  text: the GPTs did not have access to the best that ChatGPT had to offer. It couldn't
    really take advantage of all of the tools and modes within ChatGPT at the time.
    That now has changed because OpenAI recently updated custom GPTs.

    non-deterministic nature means reproducibility is not guaranteed, and users must
    expect variability.'

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: if you do it once and it works, and then you go do it live in front of a bunch
    of people, or in my case, you know, at least thousands of people on the podcast,
    it's going to break. It's not going to work, but that's fine. That's why I do

    using the ''@'' mention feature, allowing users to switch specialized tools without
    starting a new thread.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: there's actually some additional functionality. And the biggest one is you
    can just click the add button when you are using a normal chat. So when I do that,
    I can bring up my recent GPTs. So you can be having a conversation or you could
    use as an example deep research, and then you could transition right away and
    start using GPTs.

    workflows together within a single session, leveraging the context window effectively
    across different tasks.'

  text: You can get it right just once, save that as a GPT, and then add mention each
    of those GPTs, and then when I'm done... I can go, X out of that GPT and then
    I can click the next one and keep going, right? So it's an easy way to work with
    multiple smaller specific custom versions of ChatGPT using the same context window.
  topic: strategy/business

    and easy model migration (e.g., to newer models like GPT-4o) without rebuilding

  text: Any old GPTs, whether they're GPTs that you made or someone else made and
    put them in the GPT store, they can be upgraded and use the latest models. It's
    a one-click thing in the settings. That's the good thing. You don't have to rebuild
    it.

    language interfaces, lowering the barrier to entry significantly.
  relevance_score: 9

summary: '## Podcast Summary: EP 559: ChatGPT’s Updated Custom GPTs: What’s New and
  How They Work


  This episode of the Everyday AI Show focuses entirely on the significant recent
  updates to OpenAI''s Custom GPTs feature, highlighting how these changes dramatically
  increase their utility for business and individual workflows. The host argues that
  the initial 2023 launch was overhyped because the GPTs lacked access to the best
  underlying models, a limitation that has now been resolved.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **enhancement of Custom GPTs** following OpenAI''s latest
  model releases. Key discussion points include the expanded model selection (especially
  the integration of GPT-4o), practical demonstrations of complex, multi-step GPTs,
  and the strategic value of using these customized tools for repetitive knowledge
  work.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Expanded Model Support:** Creators can now select from the full suite of ChatGPT
  models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, GPT-3.5, etc.) when building or updating a GPT, allowing
  for fine-tuning performance based on task needs (e.g., using faster models for simple
  tasks or advanced reasoning models for complex ones).

  *   **Action Limitation:** A key technical caveat is that GPTs utilizing **Custom
  Actions** (APIs, webhooks) are currently restricted to using only the GPT-4o model,
  while GPTs without actions can leverage the full model picker.

  *   **Agentic Capabilities of 3.5:** The host notes that the updated GPT-3.5 model
  exhibits impressive agentic behavior, capable of dynamically switching between research,
  code execution (via Code Interpreter), and knowledge retrieval mid-task, making
  it a powerful workhorse, comparable to models like Gemini 1.5 Pro.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Democratization of Custom AI:** The updates effectively allow companies to
  create internally fine-tuned AI assistants for specific roles without the massive
  development costs previously required, essentially offering a no-code path to specialized
  internal LLM applications.

  *   **ROI Acceleration:** By saving time on repetitive knowledge work (research,
  summarization, synthesis), businesses can quickly realize ROI on their Gen AI investment
  by standardizing complex workflows into easily accessible GPTs.

  *   **Strategic Model Selection:** Businesses can now optimize costs and performance
  by assigning the most appropriate model (e.g., faster, cheaper 3.5 for routine tasks;
  powerful 4o for critical analysis) to each custom tool.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **OpenAI:** The developer of the Custom GPTs feature and the underlying models
  (GPT-4o, etc.).

  *   **Everyday AI (Host/Company):** Mentioned as an expert consultancy that trains
  teams on leveraging ChatGPT Enterprise and Teams, positioning themselves as leaders
  in practical AI implementation.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is moving toward highly specialized, modular
  AI agents accessible through simple interfaces. The ability to easily swap models
  within a single custom tool indicates a future where AI deployment is highly flexible,
  cost-aware, and tailored to specific performance envelopes rather than relying on
  a single, monolithic model. The host also hints at advanced topics like "context
  stacking" and "actions" for future deep dives.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI Practitioners, Business Leaders, Knowledge
  Workers, and Technology Managers** who are already using ChatGPT Plus/Team and are
  looking for practical, actionable ways to move beyond basic prompting into building
  scalable, repeatable AI workflows within their organizations.'
