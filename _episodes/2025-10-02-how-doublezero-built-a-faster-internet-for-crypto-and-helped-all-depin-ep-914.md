  text: When I got into crypto, it was sort of the end of 2017, beginning of 2018,
    and back then, software was 100% the limiting factor in blockchain scale and power...
    We're in a very different place now. If you look at the fast L1s, whether it's
    Monads, Alana, Apto, or Sui, in their test nets, and if you benchmark the actual
    validator clients, you can get hundreds of thousands, if not a million transactions
    per second.

    This is what gets better connections between tokenized equities and traditional

    on their Fire Dancer client at a breakpoint last year in Singapore in 2024...
    That is not possible over the public internet because the public internet is actually

  text: Ethereum, and this is not a knock on Ethereum, is designed to be slow. Blocks

  text: We received what's called relief for two components covered as part of the
    no-action letter. The main one that was the most important to us is the contributor
    reward payouts. Most of our potential contributor groups are not crypto-native
    people at all. They're companies like NTT or Lumen that sometimes are public or

    blockchain performance, helping crypto professionals understand why current networks
    can't reach their theoretical limits.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The trick is the public internet was never built for this. The public internet
    is incredibly good at reaching any point in the world... but it's very latency-prone
    and indirect in the routing.
  topic: technology

  text: There's another secret component of this, which is there's a measurement on
    the public internet called jitter. Jitter is the standard deviation of latencies...
    In some of our testing from California to Singapore, you'll have a consistent
    data transmission rate of maybe 300 milliseconds latency, but sometimes those
    packets are getting there in 250 milliseconds, and sometimes they're getting there
    in 800 milliseconds.
  topic: technology

    and market efficiency, which is crucial for understanding the economic incentives
    driving infrastructure development.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is absolutely a very attractive product for traders in the sense that
    they now have more determinism in how they send a transaction... If you're trading
    on the public internet, you have no idea. It could be 35 milliseconds or 350 milliseconds.
    That determinism is really important for traders in feeling confident to make
    trades.
  topic: defi

    economics issue rather than a technical one, suggesting new approaches to solving
    scalability.

  text: We want to make it the software engineers' job to make the networks faster
    again. Right now, it's on the public internet, waiting for it to get fast. The
    public internet eats bandwidth as quickly as you can throw it at it, and there's
    not a monetary incentive to do so.

  text: You would think, oh, Facebook, a giant public internet company, must use the
    public internet for everything. Turns out they don't. They're actually the biggest
    investor in private fiber and subsea fiber in the world right now... If the public
    internet is too slow for Instagram reels, we think it's probably too slow for
    blockchain to really start competing with traditional finance.

  text: We use something called proof of utility, which resembles proof of work. If
    you think about a system like double zero, we are not securing state. This is
    effectively a stateless network, where we have to secure data that's momentarily
    in transit.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Highlights the importance of proportional rewards in decentralized
    networks and how this principle can be applied beyond traditional mining
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: One of the great things about Bitcoin is if I show up with 20% of the hash
    power, I earn 20% of the rewards averaged out over enough time. It doesn't matter
    if I'm Michael Saylor or if I own zero Bitcoin; my rewards are directly proportional
    to my contributions to that network. We have that same property on double zero.

    preventing willing traditional companies from participating
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: All the adoption hurdles we've seen with traditional finance and uncertainty
    around accepting stablecoins or paying gas fees were due to years of companies
    like Visa and MasterCard being unsure about what they were allowed to do, even
    though they wanted to.

summary: "# Podcast Summary: How DoubleZero Built a Faster Internet for Crypto and\
  \ Helped All DePIN - Ep. 914\n\n## Quick Analysis for Crypto Professionals\n\n**1.\
  \ Crypto Focus Area**: \nDePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure), blockchain\
  \ scalability, validator infrastructure, and the intersection of traditional finance\
  \ with on-chain trading systems.\n\n**2. Key Technical Insights**:\n• Modern blockchain\
  \ software can handle 100K-1M+ TPS locally, but public internet latency/routing\
  \ is now the primary bottleneck for distributed networks\n• DoubleZero uses \"proof\
  \ of utility\" with Shapley values instead of traditional proof-of-stake, rewarding\
  \ contributors based on actual network value rather than token holdings\n• The network\
  \ operates as a parallel internet using dedicated fiber, reducing jitter and providing\
  \ deterministic routing for blockchain validators\n\n**3. Market/Investment Angle**:\n\
  • Enables more sophisticated trading strategies by providing deterministic latency\
  \ for arbitrage opportunities across global markets\n• Could accelerate blockchain\
  \ parameter improvements (faster block times, higher throughput) once network constraints\
  \ are removed\n• Positions crypto infrastructure to better compete with traditional\
  \ finance execution speeds\n\n**4. Notable Crypto Projects/People**:\n• Jump Trading\
  \ (28% token allocation, contributed existing fiber infrastructure)\n• Solana/Fire\
  \ Dancer team (demonstrated 1M TPS using early DoubleZero network)\n• Multiple L1s\
  \ mentioned: Solana, Sui, Aptos, Monad, Alana as primary beneficiaries\n\n**5. Regulatory/Policy\
  \ Discussion**:\nReceived SEC no-action letter for contributor reward mechanisms,\
  \ potentially setting precedent for DePIN projects and helping traditional infrastructure\
  \ companies participate in crypto networks without securities law concerns.\n\n\
  **6. Future Implications**:\nCould enable true competition between on-chain and\
  \ traditional finance by removing infrastructure bottlenecks, potentially facilitating\
  \ tokenized equity trading and NASDAQ on-chain integration.\n\n**7. Target Audience**:\n\
  Validators, RPC providers, institutional traders, DePIN investors, and infrastructure-focused\
  \ crypto companies.\n\n---\n\n## Comprehensive Episode Analysis\n\nThis episode\
  \ features Austin Federer, co-founder of DoubleZero (00.Finance), discussing a fundamental\
  \ infrastructure problem that most crypto professionals overlook: network latency\
  \ and bandwidth limitations that prevent blockchains from reaching their true potential.\n\
  \n### The Core Problem and Solution\n\nThe central thesis challenges conventional\
  \ wisdom about blockchain scalability. While the crypto community has focused intensively\
  \ on software optimization, Federer argues that modern blockchain clients can already\
  \ process hundreds of thousands to over a million transactions per second when running\
  \ locally. The real bottleneck has shifted to network infrastructure—specifically,\
  \ the public internet's inability to handle the low-latency, high-bandwidth requirements\
  \ of truly distributed blockchain networks.\n\nDoubleZero's solution involves creating\
  \ a parallel internet using dedicated fiber infrastructure contributed by independent\
  \ operators. Unlike traditional corporate networks (used by Facebook, Google, Amazon,\
  \ and major trading firms like Jump and Citadel), this network operates as a decentralized\
  \ protocol where multiple entities contribute fiber capacity and earn tokens based\
  \ on actual utility provided.\n\n### Technical Innovation and Architecture\n\nThe\
  \ project introduces several novel concepts to crypto infrastructure. Their \"proof\
  \ of utility\" consensus mechanism uses Shapley values—an economic concept that\
  \ measures how much worse a system would perform without each component. This creates\
  \ a more nuanced reward system than traditional proof-of-stake, where a critical\
  \ connection to a remote location like Perth might earn more rewards than redundant\
  \ infrastructure in oversupplied markets like New York.\n\nThe network operates\
  \ statelessly, focusing on data in transit rather than securing stored value. This\
  \ fundamental difference allows for a different security model than traditional\
  \ blockchains, requiring less capital security since no permanent state is at risk.\n\
  \n### Business Model and Token Economics\n\nThe 2Z token serves multiple functions:\
  \ payment for network access, rewards for infrastructure contributors, and a deflationary\
  \ mechanism where approximately 50% of usage fees are burned. The system accommodates\
  \ both crypto-native users (who can pay in native tokens like SOL) and traditional\
  \ infrastructure companies (who pay directly in 2Z tokens).\n\nThe controversial\
  \ 28% allocation to Jump Trading reflects their multiple roles: core technology\
  \ contributor (Fire Dancer team), first major infrastructure contributor (providing\
  \ existing fiber network access), and early investor. This allocation structure\
  \ highlights the capital-intensive nature of physical infrastructure compared to\
  \ software-only blockchain projects.\n\n### Regulatory Breakthrough\n\nPerhaps most\
  \ significantly for the broader DePIN sector, DoubleZero obtained an SEC no-action\
  \ letter covering their contributor reward mechanisms. This regulatory clarity addresses\
  \ a major adoption barrier for traditional infrastructure companies—entities like\
  \ NTT or Lumen that operate fiber networks but lack crypto-specific legal expertise.\
  \ The precedent could accelerate institutional participation in decentralized infrastructure\
  \ projects.\n\n### Market Implications and Future Vision\n\nThe conversation reveals\
  \ ambitious long-term goals extending beyond crypto. Federer envisions enabling\
  \ on-chain trading of tokenized equities at parity with traditional markets, potentially\
  \ bringing NASDAQ trading on-chain. This infrastructure could eliminate the latency\
  \ disadvantages that currently prevent blockchain-based financial systems from competing\
  \ directly with traditional finance.\n\nFor traders, the network promises deterministic\
  \ latency—knowing exactly how long transactions take rather than dealing with public\
  \ internet variability. This predictability enables tighter market making and smaller\
  \ arbitrage opportunities, potentially improving overall market efficiency.\n\n\
  ### Industry Context and Challenges\n\nThe episode illuminates the physical realities\
  \ underlying crypto's digital aspirations. While Ethereum's design philosophy"
