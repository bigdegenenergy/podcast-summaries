    work. When I left—not left, because Salesforce and Slack are the same company—but
    when I went to Slack, what I didn't do is just take the Salesforce playbook and
    try to implement that at Slack. I went in and listened and learned, understood

    experience to help enable Slack.

summary: '## 20Sales: Sierra: Inside Silicon Valley''s Fastest Growing Sales Machine
  & How to Prospect, Outbound and Close Enterprise Deals in AI - Comprehensive Summary


  This 67-minute episode of *20 Sales* features Reggie Marable, the Head of Global
  Sales at Sierra (a fast-growing AI company founded by Brett Taylor and backed by
  Benchmark/Greenoaks). The discussion centers on Reggie’s journey, the development
  of Sierra’s enterprise sales machine, and the specific methodologies required to
  prospect, qualify, and close complex AI deals in the enterprise space.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Enterprise Sales Strategy and Execution within the Artificial
  Intelligence (AI) sector**. Key themes include leadership reinvention, building
  a scalable sales process from the ground up in a startup environment (Series A/B
  stage), enterprise deal qualification (especially around AI solutions), and the
  critical role of deep customer partnership and technical integration.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **SPEAR Sales Methodology:** Sierra has formalized its sales process, moving
  beyond standard frameworks like MEDDIC/Challenger to create **SPEAR**: **S**trategic
  Partnerships, **U**se Case articulation, **R**eturn on Investment (ROI) justification,
  and **C**ompelling execution.

  *   **Paid Proof of Concept (POC) Model:** To de-risk AI adoption and demonstrate
  immediate value, Sierra utilizes a paid POC where clients test the technology on
  specific, complex journeys. The POC investment is credited toward the long-term
  contract, ensuring commitment and immediate focus on measurable outcomes (e.g.,
  containment/resolution rates).

  *   **Forward-Deployed Engineering (FDE) Model:** Sierra embeds highly technical
  teams (Agent Product Managers and Engineers) directly into the client engagement
  during the POC phase. This FDE model acts as a full-service solution, integrating
  deeply with client IT and business teams to ensure successful deployment and continuous
  agent improvement post-sale.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Enterprise AI Sales Cycle:** Enterprise AI sales cycles are long, averaging
  **around eight months** from the first meeting to closing, largely due to the need
  for technology deployment, trust-building, and rigorous legal/governance reviews
  inherent in AI adoption.

  *   **Verticalization Strategy:** Despite serving broad industries (Financial Services,
  Healthcare, Telecom, etc.), Sierra prioritizes **verticalization** in its sales
  structure. This allows the team to speak the customer’s language, understand specific
  industry trends, and craft highly relevant messaging, which is crucial for high-value
  enterprise deals.

  *   **Brand Velocity:** Strong customer validity and social proof (customer stories)
  are essential for driving velocity and potentially compressing the lengthy enterprise
  sales cycle.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Reggie Marable:** Highlighted his career pivot from a failed CRO role (where
  ego hindered leadership) to joining Salesforce as a first-line leader with humility,
  adopting the mantra: "What are you doing for others?" (MLK Jr. quote).

  *   **Sierra:** The subject company, noted for its rapid growth, founded by **Brett
  Taylor** (praised as an "apex predator" salesperson for his ability to connect tech
  to business value).

  *   **Salesforce & Slack:** Mentioned as previous employers where Reggie learned
  the importance of *not* imposing a playbook but adapting strategy to the specific
  needs of the new organization.

  *   **Sponsors/Mentors:** Larry Shirts, Frank Filman, Danny Hertzberg, Zach Lorick,
  and Kevin Egan were mentioned as influential figures.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched upon the increased scrutiny and governance required for AI
  deals, noting that the need for **legal, compliance, and governance reviews** significantly
  contributes to the extended sales cycle.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that successful enterprise AI sales require a shift from
  transactional selling to deep, integrated **partnership**. The FDE model indicates
  that for complex AI solutions, the vendor must be willing to take on significant
  implementation risk and embed itself within the client’s operations to prove value,
  rather than relying on self-serve or lighter-touch models initially. The industry
  is moving toward requiring demonstrable ROI within the initial engagement phase.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Enterprise Sales Leaders, CROs, VP of Sales,
  Founders scaling B2B/AI SaaS companies, and Sales Operations professionals** focused
  on complex, high-ACV outbound strategies.

  ### Comprehensive Narrative Arc & Key Takeaways


  The episode follows Reggie Marable’s journey from a significant leadership failure
  as a CRO to his current success building the sales engine at Sierra. The central
  narrative is one of **humility, reinvention, and process engineering**.


  Reggie detailed how his initial failure taught him the necessity of putting people
  first and listening—a lesson he carried into Salesforce, where he accepted a demotion
  to rebuild his credibility. Upon joining Sierra (as employee #23), he consciously
  avoided importing the "Salesforce playbook," instead synthesizing his experiences
  to build Sierra’s unique **SPEAR** methodology.


  A major focus was on **enterprise deal qualification and execution**. Reggie stressed
  that multi-threading is a "team sport" requiring leadership involvement, and that
  in the post-pandemic environment, proving tangible ROI is non-negotiable. The paid
  POC, supported by the **Forward-Deployed Engineering (FDE) model**, is Sierra’s
  mechanism for de-risking AI adoption for the client while ensuring the sales team
  can demonstrate immediate, measurable value (Time to Value).


  Finally, Reggie emphasized the relentless nature of top-tier enterprise sales, noting
  that he and the founders still actively prospect daily ("take out the trash"). He
  advocates for **craftsmanship'
