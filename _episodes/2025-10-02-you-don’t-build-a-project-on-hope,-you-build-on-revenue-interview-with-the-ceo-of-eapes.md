summary: '## Podcast Summary: "You don’t build a project on hope, you build on revenue"
  - Interview with the CEO of EAPES


  This 63-minute episode of GM Web 3 features an in-depth interview with **Crypto
  Mercy, the CEO of EAPES**, one of the oldest and largest NFT collections on the
  **MultiversX** ecosystem. The discussion centers on the EAPES journey, navigating
  challenges in a bear market, the strategic expansion to **Solana**, and the fundamental
  philosophy of building sustainable Web3 projects.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion is primarily focused on **Web3 Project Sustainability and Execution
  within the MultiversX and Solana Ecosystems**. Key themes include NFT project management,
  community governance, overcoming development hurdles, and the critical shift from
  building on hype to building on revenue.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **EAPES Island Development:** The project is actively developing "EABS Island,"
  featuring playable zones, a showroom (starting on Bitcoin Bay), and a DJ platform,
  aiming to integrate their 3D avatars into various metaverse spaces.

  *   **3D Asset Strategy:** Initial 3D asset work was done with Cyberpunk City (who
  later left MultiversX), but EAPES successfully transitioned development to a new,
  talented 3D designer, **Redbreak Hamet**, ensuring continuity despite partner departures.

  *   **dApp Utility:** EAPES has expanded its utility through a dedicated marketplace
  for island assets (lands, properties), a tool for creating social media banners/PFP
  images, and the **EABS Pool** for token accumulation.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Revenue Over Hype:** The CEO strongly advocates that projects cannot survive
  on hype alone; they must generate **revenue** to pay developers and cover operational
  expenses, especially during market downturns.

  *   **Ecosystem Resilience:** EAPES has sustained operations despite the significant
  drop in EGLD price and general NFT volume decline, demonstrating resilience through
  strategic effort and community focus.

  *   **Solana Expansion:** The decision to launch a capsule collection on Solana
  (3,333 new NFTs) is a strategic move to expand reach and tap into different market
  dynamics, although the artistic direction of using AI-generated assets (like relics/necklaces)
  was met with some internal skepticism.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Crypto Mercy (CEO of EAPES):** Former professional volleyball player, background
  in communications/multimedia, and runs a coaching channel ("The Hub") focused on
  market interrelations. He took over EAPES leadership after a community election
  following initial founder/CEO departures.

  *   **Carl:** Co-founder of EAPES who was instrumental in saving the project initially
  and pushing for community governance before stepping down.

  *   **DB (MultiversX Ventures - MSV):** The VC arm that initially invested in EAPES
  (the first VC investment in an NFT project on MultiversX), but later left due to
  community disappointment over low involvement post-investment.

  *   **Cyberpunk City (Alil & Cancer):** A former development partner for 3D assets
  who later moved to Solana and reportedly lost their treasury in a leveraged trade
  involving a memecoin.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No specific regulatory discussions were highlighted, but the conversation heavily
  touched upon **governance and community trust**. The CEO emphasized the importance
  of transparency, especially during the transition of leadership and dealing with
  community disappointment regarding roadmap execution and token price performance.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a trend where established, resilient NFT projects are
  looking beyond their native chains (like MultiversX) to expand their user base (e.g.,
  Solana). Furthermore, the focus is clearly shifting towards **utility, playable
  assets (metaverse integration), and sustainable revenue streams** rather than speculative
  PFP trading volume.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Web3 Founders, NFT Project Managers, MultiversX/Solana
  Ecosystem Participants, and Community Leaders** interested in long-term project
  sustainability and navigating bear market challenges.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The interview provided a deep dive into the operational philosophy and history of
  the EAPES NFT project under the leadership of CEO Crypto Mercy. The narrative began
  with Mercy’s background—a former athlete with a finance-adjacent family history—and
  his early adoption of crypto.


  The core of the discussion focused on the tumultuous **genesis of EAPES on MultiversX**.
  The project initially lacked a clear roadmap, leading the original founders to step
  down. This triggered a community election for a new CEO, which Crypto Mercy ultimately
  won after navigating complex internal politics, including the brief involvement
  and subsequent exit of MultiversX Ventures (MSV).


  Upon taking the helm, Mercy discovered significant discrepancies: the existing development
  work (like EABS Island files) was far less advanced than promised, resembling "fucking
  templates." Despite the temptation to quit, Mercy’s fighter mentality and commitment
  to the long-term community drove him forward.


  A central theme was **building during adversity**. Mercy detailed the difficulty
  of maintaining momentum while EGLD and NFT volumes plummeted. His actionable advice
  was encapsulated in the title quote: **"You don’t build a project on hope, you build
  on revenue."** He stressed the necessity of generating income to sustain a full-time
  team, noting that personal compensation was secondary to ensuring employees were
  paid, often requiring creative solutions to manage the treasury, which was largely
  denominated in the depreciating EGLD.


  Key milestones celebrated include the successful creation of 13,333 3D avatars usable
  across metaverses, the launch of the dApp utilities, and the ongoing development
  of EABS Island'
