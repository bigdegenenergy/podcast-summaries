summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #1542 Jordi Visser | Bitcoin Could DOUBLE In
  Price This Year?!


  This episode of the Pom Podcast features Anthony Pompliano in conversation with
  Jordy Visser, a veteran of 30 years on Wall Street. The discussion centers on Visser''s
  macroeconomic outlook, his analysis of the current monetary global order, and a
  highly bullish case for Bitcoin, framed through the lens of his unique background
  in odds assessment, drawing parallels to horse race handicapping.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Macroeconomics and Investment Strategy**, heavily centered
  on **Bitcoin''s potential performance** relative to traditional assets (stocks and
  gold). Key themes include the resilience of the US economy against recessionary
  predictions, the impact of corporate capital expenditures (especially in AI), and
  shifts in global monetary dynamics.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **AI CapEx Validation:** The massive capital expenditure commitments by tech
  giants (Meta, Google, etc.) related to AI are proving the market narrative correct,
  contradicting bearish predictions that these investments would stall.

  *   **Labor Market Resilience:** The continued lack of significant job losses, coupled
  with 4.3% year-over-year income growth, fundamentally undermines the probability
  of a traditional recession, as consumption (70% of the economy) remains robust.

  *   **Structural Economic Shifts:** The economy is structurally different post-2008,
  characterized by massive government transfer payments ($4.5 trillion, or 15% of
  the economy) and an aging population offset by immigration, making historical recession
  models less applicable.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Recession Narrative is Flawed:** Visser argues that betting on known negative
  narratives (like an impending recession) when market positioning is already low
  is not where value lies. The data strongly suggests a soft landing or continued
  growth.

  *   **Sector Rotation Expected:** The market is expected to transition away from
  high-multiple "sexy growth stories" (like the Mag 7) toward sectors that are demonstrably
  working, such as healthcare, financials, and commodities, as investors seek to meet
  liabilities.

  *   **Bitcoin''s Outperformance Potential:** Due to the failure of traditional growth
  stocks to significantly outperform interest rates, Visser believes institutions
  and retail investors will be forced into assets that *are* working. He significantly
  increased his year-end price target for Bitcoin, suggesting it could reach new all-time
  highs by summer, potentially doubling its price this year.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordy Visser:** Guest, leveraging 30 years of Wall Street experience and a
  unique "handicapping" approach to odds and value assessment.

  *   **Warren Buffett:** Mentioned for his early career in horse race handicapping,
  drawing a parallel to Visser''s methodology.

  *   **Mag 7 (Mega-Cap Tech):** Central to the discussion regarding earnings expectations
  and future market leadership.

  *   **Bitwise & ZappoBank:** Sponsors mentioned, highlighting the growth of regulated
  Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin-backed lending solutions.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Tariffs and Inflation:** Visser critiques bears for relying on simplistic
  economic models regarding tariffs (assuming they are purely inflationary) without
  accounting for behavioral changes, domestic substitution, or supply chain manipulation
  (e.g., transshipment via Vietnam).

  *   **Global Reserve Currency Risk:** There is growing concern among international
  investors regarding the weaponization of the dollar and sanctions, leading to increased
  central bank gold accumulation and reduced trust in US Treasuries, which impacts
  the broader financial system.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation points toward a bifurcated market: the stock market may reach new
  all-time highs driven by sentiment shifts and corporate buybacks, but it will likely
  be "choppy" and lack broad-based performance. The real lift is expected to come
  from assets like **Bitcoin and commodities**, which are demonstrating tangible performance
  against a backdrop of global monetary uncertainty and structural labor shortages.
  The need for institutions (like endowments) to meet liabilities will force capital
  into these high-performing assets.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Financial Professionals, Institutional Investors,
  and Sophisticated Retail Investors** interested in macro strategy, asset allocation,
  and deep dives into the fundamental drivers supporting Bitcoin''s next major price
  move.'
