summary: '## 20VC: Four Traits of the Most Successful Founders | How to Hunt and Close
  Talent Like a Pro and Where All Founders Go Wrong | Lessons Raising $397M From the
  Best Investors in the World with Eléonore Crespo @ Pigment


  This episode features Harry Stebbings (20VC) in conversation with Eléonore Crespo,
  Co-founder and CEO of Pigment, a rapidly scaling European business planning platform
  that has raised over $397M from top-tier investors. The discussion centers on Eléonore''s
  journey from VC (Index Ventures) to founder, the critical traits of successful founders,
  the unique dynamics of her co-CEO structure, and her rigorous, proactive approach
  to talent acquisition.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion is firmly rooted in **General Tech/SaaS Entrepreneurship and Scaling**.
  Key themes include founder psychology, strategic hiring, board dynamics, the transition
  from investing to founding, and building a generational company.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Co-CEO Superpower for Customer Focus:** The co-CEO structure (Eléonore focusing
  on the business/GTM, Roma on product/engineering) allows the leadership team to
  dedicate **twice the time** to customer interaction, which Eléonore views as the
  ultimate competitive advantage for building a customer-first product.

  *   **Valuing Experienced Operators:** Eléonore strongly advocates for hiring executives
  who have "seen the movie"—specifically, those who have scaled a company from the
  current ARR stage to multiple billions, as they bring invaluable learned lessons
  to avoid common pitfalls.

  *   **The "Never Settle" Mindset:** The most crucial trait in experienced hires
  (like her co-founder Roma) is an ingrained **curiosity and a commitment to never
  settling**, ensuring continuous adaptation even after achieving success.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Board Power Dynamics:** Eléonore emphasizes that founders must respect the
  power of the board, noting that the board ultimately has the authority to remove
  the CEO, underscoring the need for strong alignment.

  *   **VC as Founder Training:** Her experience at Index Ventures is framed as the
  "best college of life" for a founder, providing unparalleled insight into what "amazing"
  looks like in execution and scale.

  *   **Investor Alignment:** Eléonore intentionally sought investors who would challenge
  her, valuing those who push leaders to think harder rather than simply agreeing
  with the status quo.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Pigment:** The focus company, a rapidly growing business planning platform.

  *   **Roma (Co-founder/Co-CEO):** Highlighted for his complementary technical leadership,
  humility despite prior success (Criteo IPO), and ability to challenge Eléonore constructively.

  *   **Index Ventures:** Eléonore’s former firm, cited as crucial for learning operational
  excellence.

  *   **Top Founders Traits (as learned from VCs):** Psychology/Human Understanding,
  Incredible Storytelling (especially for investors/public), Having a Truth-Telling
  Partner, and Relentlessness/Ambition.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  None explicitly discussed. The focus remained strictly on business building, talent,
  and fundraising strategy.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that in the current market, **storytelling and human psychology**
  are as critical to success as product excellence, especially for attracting top
  talent and securing investment. Furthermore, the success of the co-CEO model implies
  that rigid, traditional governance structures may be suboptimal for companies prioritizing
  deep customer immersion.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Founders (especially early to mid-stage SaaS
  CEOs), Executive Recruiters, and Venture Capital Professionals** interested in operational
  excellence, talent strategy, and founder psychology.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  Eléonore Crespo’s discussion with Harry Stebbings provides a deep dive into the
  strategic mindset required to build a "generational defining business," drawing
  heavily on her transition from a successful investor at Index Ventures to the CEO
  of Pigment.


  The narrative arc begins with the unlikely origin of Pigment: Eléonore’s year-long
  recovery from back surgery, which provided the necessary space to crystallize her
  ambition to found a company and meticulously select her co-founder, Roma. She stresses
  that co-founder selection is a multi-year sourcing exercise, prioritizing **complementary
  skills, shared values, and the ability to maintain a strong partnership for 20+
  years.** Key traits she sought included humility (even after prior success like
  Criteo’s IPO) and a commitment to continuous self-improvement.


  A major point of contention with conventional wisdom is Pigment’s **co-CEO structure**.
  Eléonore argues this works because it allows both leaders to dedicate maximum time
  to their respective domains—Roma to product vision and Eléonore to business building
  and, crucially, **customer obsession**. This dual focus grants them a "superpower"
  in gathering customer insights that single CEOs often lack due to time constraints.


  Eléonore outlines a rigorous, four-part framework for identifying the **Four Traits
  of the Most Successful Founders**, derived from her time observing top performers
  at Index: 1) Mastery of **Psychology** (understanding people), 2) Exceptional **Storytelling**
  (essential for investors and marketing), 3) Having a **Truth-Telling Partner** (someone
  unafraid to challenge), and 4) **Relentlessness/Ambition**.


  The most detailed section covers **Talent Acquisition**, which Eléonore calls the
  number one job. Her process is proactive and continuous:

  1.  **Constant Sourcing:** Actively scouting talent everywhere (e.g., asking competitors
  who the best rep on'
