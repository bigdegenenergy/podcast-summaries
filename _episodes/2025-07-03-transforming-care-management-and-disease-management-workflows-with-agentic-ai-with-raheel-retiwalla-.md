summary: '## Podcast Summary: Transforming Care Management and Disease Management
  Workflows with Agentic AI


  This episode of the AI and Business Podcast, featuring Raheel Retiwalla, CSO of
  Productive Edge, focuses on the immediate and transformative impact of **Agentic
  AI** on healthcare''s most complex operational areas: **Care Management and Disease
  Management**. The discussion centers on how these systems augment existing staff,
  connect fragmented data, and drive real-time action to improve outcomes under the
  increasing pressures of value-based care.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the application of **Agentic AI** within healthcare payer and
  provider workflows, specifically targeting **Care Management, Disease Management,
  Behavioral Health, and Complex Case Management**. The discussion emphasizes using
  AI agents as infrastructure-level augmentations to streamline processes like utilization
  tracking, medication adherence nudging, and care plan generation, rather than replacing
  human roles.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Agentic Augmentation over Replacement:** Agentic AI is positioned not as a
  replacement for care managers or rules-based systems, but as a layer that surrounds
  and supercharges existing platforms by providing real-time aggregation, insights,
  and activation capabilities.

  *   **Maturity Curve for Deployment:** A clear framework for adoption is outlined:
  starting with **Summarization/Aggregation**, moving to **Recommendation/Nudging/Activation**,
  and culminating in **Execution** of tasks, allowing organizations to achieve quick
  wins without immediate, full-scale overhauls.

  *   **Connecting Signal to Action:** Agents excel at mining unstructured data (like
  clinical notes or EMR signals) to identify rising risk (e.g., for diabetes or hypertension)
  and immediately connecting that signal to the relevant, existing workflow or stakeholder
  (e.g., nudging a provider or reprioritizing a care team''s to-do list).


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Addressing Core Business Pressures:** The momentum for agentic AI is driven
  by converging pressures: increased financial risk tied to outcomes in value-based
  care, chronic staffing constraints leading to high turnover, and the rising complexity
  of chronic conditions and SDOH.

  *   **Immediate ROI in Low-Friction Areas:** Early, successful use cases (like tracking
  authorization counters or medication adherence) demonstrate immediate value by preventing
  care disruptions, improving Star Ratings, and enabling consistent guidance across
  different operational silos.

  *   **Efficiency in Compliance and Planning:** Agents significantly reduce the manual
  overhead associated with creating and updating service plans by instantly providing
  necessary state-based rules, compliance regulations, and guidelines, thus unlocking
  scaled value from existing investments.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Raheel Retiwalla (Productive Edge):** Chief Strategy Officer, providing expert
  insights on the practical deployment and strategic value of agentic AI in healthcare
  operations.

  *   **Productive Edge:** The sponsoring organization, highlighted as a digital transformation
  consultancy specializing in helping payers and providers leverage data for operational
  streamlining.

  *   **US Payers & International Health Plans:** Mentioned as active adopters, with
  specific examples provided for Medicare/Medicaid populations and international clients
  focusing on utilization management.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a highly personalized, omnichannel engagement model
  where AI agents act as the connective tissue between disparate data sources and
  activation channels (SMS, app, email). The future involves agents proactively managing
  long-term tracking for complex areas like behavioral health and automating the preparation
  for high-value human interactions, such as complex case management reviews.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Healthcare Executives (C-Suite, VPs of Operations,
  Strategy Leaders)**, **Payer and Provider IT/Digital Transformation Leaders**, and
  **Healthcare Consultants** who are seeking actionable strategies for deploying AI
  to solve immediate operational bottlenecks and scale value-based care initiatives
  without massive infrastructure replacement.

  ### Comprehensive Narrative Summary


  Raheel Retiwalla argues that **Agentic AI** is the critical technology needed now
  to address the operational crisis in care and disease management, which is being
  exacerbated by the shift to value-based care and persistent staffing shortages.
  He stresses that the goal is **augmentation**, not replacement, freeing up stretched
  care teams from mundane data-chasing to focus on high-value patient interaction.


  Retiwalla provided concrete, operational examples of agentic AI in production across
  US payers. One key use case involves **utilization tracking**, where agents monitor
  service limits (like physical therapy visits) in real-time, alerting care managers
  and nudging members/providers before limits are breached, thus avoiding denials
  and care disruption. Another example centers on **medication adherence**, where
  agents synthesize signals from pharmacy data and EMRs to provide care teams with
  prescriptive next steps (e.g., "Member needs two refills, here is the outgoing script").


  The discussion extended internationally, showing how agents can mine unstructured
  data from admission/discharge notes to identify early signals for chronic disease
  risk (like diabetes), connecting those signals to existing enrollment workflows
  at opportune moments (e.g., when the patient is already engaged with a provider).
  This allows for proactive enrollment and stakeholder feedback across the care continuum.


  A significant portion of the conversation addressed the distinction between traditional
  **rules-based systems** and agentic AI. Retiwalla clarified that agents complement,
  rather than eliminate, rules engines. Agents are superior in the **pre-rules phase**
  (validating submission quality) and the **post-rules phase** (assisting specialist
  clinicians in complex manual reviews, such as prior authorization decisions, by
  aggregating necessary guidelines and data).


  Finally, Retiwalla presented a clear roadmap for adoption: start with **summarization**
  (e.g., preparing case management review packets), move to **activation** (nudging
  members via omnichannel approaches), and eventually reach **execution**. This phased'
