    example, you can do that.
  topic: technology/adoption
- impact_reason: Provides a powerful metric demonstrating the real-world, non-speculative
    adoption of crypto rails (stablecoins) by surpassing Visa's volume, signaling
    mainstream utility.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: For those tracking it, stablecoins have grown dramatically in usage just now,
    in the trillions of dollars higher than Visa per month. So that's been really
    good. And that's, by the way, not correlated to trading volume and things. So
    it's not speculative use cases. It seems like real use cases.

- impact_reason: Offers a novel, high-level thesis connecting the rise of crypto directly
    to the infrastructure and community-building capabilities enabled by social media.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think of crypto as being a second-order effect of social media. So, you
    go back 20 years ago and like I was thinking about social media... There would
    be no way to evangelize it and create a community around it, the way that all
    the stuff, of course, happens through social media.
  topic: strategy/adoption
- impact_reason: Directly links the second-order problems of AI (business models,
    copyright, community value) to the potential solutions offered by crypto/blockchain.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think those are all questions that, in some ways, crypto kind of address.

    (intelligence) and Crypto (coordination/governance), defining the unique value
    proposition of blockchain.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What crypto is really about is not about intelligence, it's about coordination.
    It's about solving collective action problems and coordination problems, which
    is, I think of as a non-overlapping set, a different set of problems to solve
    versus intelligence.

    distribution layers (like Google) to conduct commerce directly.'

  text: But we are getting pretty close to the point where you can actually conduct
    business activity on the internet without having to go through Google. And that
    will be with these agents, is there?

    destruction caused by generative AI in the knowledge/education sector.
  relevance_score: 10

  text: You can see it initially being disrupted in websites that are knowledge-based
    and where the model can consume the knowledge. Chegg is the best example, right?
    Which is basically it was a high-flying public company. It's a place where kids
    would go to get homework help and study guides and things like that. And then
    overnight got hit by a ton of bricks.

    knowledge bases without a clear mechanism to fund the creation of *future* high-quality,
    human-generated content.

    consumer AI applications: massive scale without the lock-in provided by traditional
    network effects.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We have gotten to this incredible scale [in consumer AI]. There is a lot of
    usage. There is a lot of monetization, but there is no network effect. And so
    how durable is that customer relationship?
  topic: strategy/business

    high value at the infrastructure (chips) and application layers, with intense
    pressure to commoditize the foundational model serving layer.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Clearly the chips and then clearly the end-user applications. And there is
    a tremendous amount of effort being exerted from a bunch of the ecosystem players
    to commoditize the middle of that, the model layer, the simple API serving.

    will accrue in the AI stack, leaving the middle layer uncertain.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We are very high conviction that at the application layer, you will have tremendous
    value and at the chip layer, you will have tremendous value. Beyond that, it is
    TBD.

    in the age of AI) to potential solutions within the crypto/blockchain space, highlighting
    its relevance beyond speculation.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: How will the money flow? How will copyright work? There are also just interesting
    questions that you can think of downstream. I think there are all questions that
    in some ways crypto can address.
  topic: technology/adoption
- impact_reason: Defines the core value proposition of stablecoins as creating a unified,
    low-friction global payment network, analogous to how WhatsApp unified SMS.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: You can think of stablecoins as you're creating a single global unified network
    without intermediaries to allow you to make payments, right? And that turns out
    once you get the infrastructure down to one penny, one second, it turns out to
    be quite popular and useful.
  topic: defi/technology

    leads to the tokenization and decentralization of other major financial assets
    (loans, stocks, treasuries).'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And that will unlock that, they'll join in, that will accelerate the network
    effect. And then the exciting thing about the stablecoin thing, right, is the
    next thing, once you have money flowing through, well, why not loans? Why not
    stocks? Why not treasury bills?
  topic: defi/adoption
- impact_reason: Provides concrete evidence of major FinTech incumbents (Stripe) prioritizing
    and acquiring stablecoin technology, validating the infrastructure's importance.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Stripe had their big product conference, and one of the big things they talked
    about, they did their biggest acquisition ever, they bought a stablecoin company,
    and it was one of the biggest parts of what they spoke about in terms of product
    advancements and their focus areas.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: Highlights the unique advantage of programmable money (crypto/stablecoins)
    in solving traditional business problems like fraud through automation and embedded
    logic.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's also the fact that it's fully programmable. So, for example, a big problem
    is invoice fraud. People send bank wire information and a PDF, and it's wrong.
    But if it's all fully programmable, you can build essentially, like, a reputation
    system and fully automate the full thing and have a weightless system.
  topic: defi/business
- impact_reason: 'Notes a surprising deviation from prior expectations: Generative
    AI''s immediate impact is on creative/knowledge work rather than purely physical
    or analytical tasks.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I don't think many people predicted that generative AI would be the kind of
    leading, the leading use case over more, like I don't know what you call analytical
    AI or whatever... The fact that it would actually be a creative thing... Coming
    for creatives before like robotic tasks is surprising.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Introduces a crucial strategic framework (second-order effects) for
    evaluating transformative technologies like AI and Crypto, moving beyond immediate
    utility.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I always like to think about second-order effects of technology, right? So,
    you go back and you look at the automobile... The second-order effect was highway
    systems and transportation and suburbs and all these other kinds of things that
    happened as a consequence later on.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: Applies the second-order effect framework to AI, using the photography-to-film
    transition as an analogy for how AI will enable entirely new media forms (like
    AI-native applications).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think one question with AI is what will be the second-order effects there?
    One thing I think about just because my interest area is like in media... you
    had film. And so film obviously requires photography, but is a new form of media
    that couldn't exist until you had photography get to a certain level of advancement,
    right?
  topic: strategy/technology
- impact_reason: Emphasizes that despite regulatory setbacks, the core technological
    build-out (infrastructure) has succeeded significantly.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: On the positive side, the infrastructure has gotten much better. So one of
    the big goals was to build send money for under one penny and under one second.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: This is a core prediction about generative AI's impact, suggesting
    true innovation beyond mere replication, analogous to photography leading to film.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But will there be new forms of media that simply couldn't have existed before?
    And my guess is there will be.

- impact_reason: Highlights the economic challenge of abundance and points toward
    the enduring value of human connection and community in the face of automated
    content creation.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: When content is abundant, presumably the cost of content goes down, the value
    goes down. But people like to engage with other people, they like to engage with
    artists, there's a human factor to it.
  topic: business
- impact_reason: Frames fundamental financial activities (money, capital formation)
    as coordination problems perfectly suited for blockchain solutions.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Money is obviously, it's a coordination problem. How do you shift value around
    the world? How do you get everyone to agree on certain standards? How do you do
    capital formation in the internet era? That's a collective action question, right?
  topic: defi
- impact_reason: Provides a specific, aggressive metric (doubling every seven months)
    for AI capability growth, indicating exponential technological acceleration.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think if you give it a set of tasks that are slightly higher order, I think
    the models are currently doubling their capabilities every seven months.
  topic: technology

    new economic rails, implicitly pointing toward decentralized payment systems (like
    crypto) for machine-to-machine transactions.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But I think it does beg the question as you go from skeuomorphic application
    of these technologies into native, there probably does need to be a different
    economy associated with them, just a number of transactions, AI to AI payments.
  topic: defi

    now we are just talking backstage about how it seems like Google might be under
    threat now, just from a search perspective.

    the AI era that potentially compensate content creators/owners, moving beyond
    traditional advertising.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: My hope would be that the AI companies, once we have the native applications,
    also come up with some native business model that is a different form. Maybe it's
    like commerce-based, or the piece that is ad-based looks something more like an
    affiliate.

    linking crypto assets (as networks) to superior defensibility compared to other
    tech sectors.
  relevance_score: 9

    so I always look at the world through that lens of like, I think networks are
    the best. They are my personal favorite types of investments because of the defensibility.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Where Crypto Meets AI with Chris Dixon & David George


  This episode, recorded live at A16Z''s 2025 LP Summit, features General Partners
  Chris Dixon (Crypto) and David George (Growth Stage Investing) discussing the intersection
  of the current state of crypto infrastructure, the explosive growth of Generative
  AI, and the resulting platform shifts that are redefining where value accrues on
  the internet.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Crypto Infrastructure Maturity** (specifically stablecoins
  and payment rails) and the **Second-Order Effects of Generative AI**, particularly
  concerning media creation, business models, and the fundamental structure of the
  internet (search and content distribution).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Crypto Infrastructure Achievement:** Core blockchain infrastructure has matured
  to the point where sending money for **under one penny and under one second** is
  now achievable, moving beyond speculative use cases toward real-world utility.

  *   **AI''s Creative Shift:** Contrary to previous expectations that AI would first
  impact manual labor (like truck driving), Generative AI has emerged as the leading
  use case, impacting **creative and knowledge work** (e.g., product, email jobs)
  first.

  *   **Media Evolution Analogy:** Generative AI''s initial impact is **skeuomorphic**
  (making existing media easier to create, like illustrations). The true second-order
  effect will be the emergence of **native new media forms** that could not exist
  without the underlying technology, similar to how film followed photography.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Stablecoin Mainstreaming:** Stablecoin usage is growing dramatically into
  the trillions of dollars monthly, now rivaling Visa''s volume, driven by non-speculative
  use cases like cross-border payments and treasury management (highlighted by Stripe''s
  major acquisition in the space).

  *   **Regulatory Unlocking:** Current regulatory uncertainty has slowed progress,
  but anticipated legislation is expected to unlock participation from conservative
  financial institutions, significantly accelerating the network effect of digital
  money.

  *   **Value Accrual in AI:** While chips and foundational models are clear winners,
  significant value will also accrue to the **application layer** that successfully
  navigates the transition from skeuomorphic to native AI experiences.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Stripe:** Mentioned for its recent acquisition of a stablecoin company and
  its focus on cross-border payments and treasury management using digital assets.

  *   **Google:** Discussed as facing a significant **Innovator''s Dilemma** regarding
  AI. Despite possessing the leading models (Gemini) and having invented much of the
  underlying technology, their highly profitable search business model (predicated
  on link clicks) is threatened by AI agents providing direct answers.

  *   **Chris Dixon & David George:** The hosts and A16Z partners framing the discussion
  on platform shifts and investment opportunities across both sectors.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The conversation highlighted the **"all-out assault" by the previous administration**
  on the crypto space, which resulted in a significant setback (estimated at four
  years) by stifling product development and deterring entrepreneurs. The expectation
  is that forthcoming legislation will unlock institutional participation and accelerate
  crypto adoption.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The convergence of AI and Crypto is inevitable. AI solves intelligence problems,
  while Crypto solves **coordination and collective action problems** (like money,
  capital formation). The future will involve these mega-trends intersecting. A major
  structural change anticipated is the **breakdown of the "original covenant of the
  internet,"** where search/social platforms distributed traffic to content sites
  in exchange for snippets. AI agents providing direct answers threaten this model,
  necessitating new business models for millions of websites dependent on link traffic.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Technology Executives, Growth-Stage Investors, Web3 Founders, and Product Strategists**
  who need to understand how platform shifts (AI) interact with foundational infrastructure
  (Crypto) to create the next wave of business models and internet architecture.'
