  text: security usually is very much boring until it isn't. But in this specific
    case, it offers you two properties that are an absolute must when talking about

    value of used/older mobile devices to acquire significant compute power cheaply,
    drastically lowering the CapEx barrier for decentralized infrastructure.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: mobile devices have a very nice property that whenever they have some sort
    of malfunction, people look at them as pretty much worthless. This means on the
    other side that you can with very little capital expense start buying a lot of
    compute, a lot of valuable compute like these devices have eight cores and 16
    gigs of RAM by now for really not that much money.

    And the only way how you can solve that is by setting the right incentives and
    by basically saying, if you say that you're going to provide compute and you get
    paid for it, there will be a penalty if you are no longer doing what you were
    saying.

    they were incremental fixes, whereas true success requires a fundamental, ground-up
    architectural redesign (like Bitcoin did for finance).

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is not a new narrative. I mean, this has come up over and over again,
    this idea of offering decentralized general compute. But what I believe that was

    the significantly lower base cost of mobile compute allows the network to absorb
    redundancy/replication costs and still undercut centralized providers.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: By offering a cost structure that is way lower, you can actually overcome
    the overhead that you will face from things like decentralization because... if
    you want to offer a really reliable service, obviously, you will need to be able
    to work with multiple replicas.

  text: We basically just created the protocol that can accommodate devices from all
    various manufacturers. As long as the manufacturers will create a so-called attestation
    of the hardware. So if they create an attestation, we know that the device is
    completely genuine and we know that it is functioning the way we expected it would.

  text: Some people are using it to scrape data because you do have a lot of various
    entry points from the consumer side of you, right? You don't have these data center
    IPs. So the way you're able to observe the internet is just through the eyes of
    the consumer. This is very, very valuable to them.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #1549 Alessandro De Carli | Is Bitcoin Decentralization
  Coming To Your Phone?!


  This episode of the Pom Podcast features Anthony Pompliano interviewing **Alessandro
  Di Carli**, co-founder of **Accurus**, about their ambitious project to build a
  decentralized computational network utilizing the latent power of everyday mobile
  phones. The conversation draws strong parallels between the success and resilience
  of the Bitcoin network and the potential for decentralized general compute.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Decentralized Infrastructure and Compute**, specifically
  exploring how the principles of decentralization, proven by Bitcoin, can be applied
  to harness the vast, underutilized computational power residing in mobile devices
  to create a resilient, globally accessible compute layer. The discussion heavily
  touches upon **mobile security (hardware security modules/TEEs)** as the foundational
  element for this new compute network.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Mobile Hardware Security as Foundation:** Mobile devices are uniquely positioned
  for decentralized compute because they possess advanced **Hardware Security Modules
  (HSMs)**, enabling critical properties like **verifiability** (proving work was
  done correctly) and **confidentiality** (preventing the host from inspecting data).

  *   **Compute Concentration Misconception:** The vast majority of global compute
  power is not in data centers but embedded within household and pocket-sized mobile
  devices, which are currently largely unused.

  *   **Network Topology Flexibility:** The Accurus network is designed to be aware
  of physical proximity, allowing devices to form local clusters for high-performance
  compute while still communicating globally over the internet.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Cost Efficiency:** Mobile devices offer a significantly lower cost structure
  for compute compared to centralized data centers due to efficient chips and the
  ability to acquire hardware cheaply (even second-hand/malfunctioning units). This
  low cost can offset the overhead associated with decentralization (e.g., replication).

  *   **Leveraging Existing R&D:** The project capitalizes on the massive R&D budgets
  of hardware manufacturers (like Apple''s $33B annual spend) by using their existing,
  highly engineered silicon without needing modification.

  *   **New Business Models:** The emergence of this infrastructure opens opportunities
  for businesses dealing in second-hand phones to institutionalize the process of
  onboarding devices into the decentralized network, mirroring the evolution of Bitcoin
  mining.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Alessandro Di Carli (Accurus Co-founder):** The guest, whose background in
  mobile security informed the project''s focus on verifiable and confidential compute.

  *   **Accurus:** The project aiming to build the decentralized mobile compute network.

  *   **Bitcoin Network:** Used as the primary case study for successful, resilient,
  and economically incentivized decentralization.

  *   **Node.js:** Mentioned as the development framework used by Accurus to lower
  the barrier to entry for developers deploying workloads.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No direct regulatory discussion occurred, but the concept of **confidential compute**
  via Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) is highlighted as a solution that allows
  users to run sensitive applications (like LLMs) without fear of the counterparty
  inspecting or tampering with the data, which has significant privacy implications.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where decentralized compute becomes an accessible
  utility, similar to how Bitcoin offered an alternative financial asset. While initial
  adoption will likely focus on **non-mission-critical** tasks, the network''s global
  scalability and local accessibility will drive broader adoption. A key predicted
  use case is running **confidential LLMs (like a private ChatGPT)** directly on the
  decentralized network.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto/Web3 Infrastructure Developers, Technology
  Strategists, Mobile Security Professionals, and Investors** interested in the convergence
  of decentralized systems, edge computing, and AI infrastructure.

  ### Comprehensive Narrative Summary


  The episode centers on the vision of **Accurus** to democratize computational resources
  by leveraging the billions of unused mobile phones globally. Alessandro Di Carli
  frames this ambition by first analyzing the **Bitcoin network**—the world''s most
  powerful decentralized computer—as proof that software rules can organize massive
  physical resources (miners) into an unstoppable, resilient system.


  Di Carli argues that just as Bitcoin provided an alternative financial asset, decentralized
  compute must offer a global, accessible alternative to centralized cloud services.
  The critical missing piece for achieving this, he asserts, is **security**, specifically
  **verifiability and confidentiality**. This is where mobile phones become the ideal
  infrastructure. Unlike data centers, phones possess sophisticated **Hardware Security
  Modules (HSMs)** that enable **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**, ensuring
  that computations remain private and the work performed is verifiable, even by the
  device owner.


  The conversation addresses the complexity of building such a network, noting that
  it requires not just miners and node operators (like Bitcoin), but also the initial
  **ideologists** who believe in the alternative. Furthermore, Accurus deliberately
  avoids partnering with hardware manufacturers, instead **piggybacking** on their
  existing R&D by utilizing the unmodified hardware and relying on standard hardware
  attestations to verify device authenticity.


  The economic incentive is rooted in the **low operational cost** of mobile chips
  compared to traditional servers. This cost advantage is necessary to overcome the
  inherent overhead of decentralized systems (like running multiple replicas).


  Practical applications already being tested on the Accurus testnet include **data
  scraping** (leveraging diverse consumer IP addresses) and running **secure Bitcoin
  wallets** within TEEs. The most compelling future use case highlighted is running
  **confidential Large Language Models (LLMs)**, allowing users to interact with powerful
  AI without any third party—including the node operator—being able to read their
  prompts or data. The'
