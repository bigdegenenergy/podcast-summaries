summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Building Trusted AI Systems in Financial Services
  From Strategy to Scale - with Zar Toolan of Edward Jones


  This 27-minute episode features Zarr Toolan, General Partner and Head of Data &
  AI at Edward Jones, discussing the critical steps financial services firms must
  take to move AI initiatives from stalled pilots to scaled, trusted production systems.
  The core narrative emphasizes the necessity of strategic alignment, robust governance,
  and human-centered change management.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **AI Transformation in Financial Services**, specifically
  addressing barriers to production adoption, establishing responsible AI governance,
  navigating the build vs. buy vs. partner decision, and managing the human element
  (change management and talent strategy) required for scaling AI.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Data Sanctity as the Coin of the Realm:** The success of any AI strategy hinges
  on the underlying data governance and the "sanctity of the data." Clean, sovereign
  data that can be transposed across multiple systems is the foundational competitive
  advantage.

  *   **Shift from Use Cases to Scalable Platforms:** Organizations should stop measuring
  progress by the sheer *number* of AI use cases (Generative or Agentic) and instead
  focus on building and measuring **scalable, repeatable platforms and patterns**
  that generate measurable strategic outcomes.

  *   **Multi-Modal Delivery:** AI solutions must be designed for **multi-modal delivery**â€”serving
  end consumers, clients, and back-office operations in structured and intentional
  ways, governed by strict data and model oversight.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Strategic Alignment is Non-Negotiable:** AI transformation cannot exist as
  a separate initiative; it must be **directly and intentionally integrated** into
  the overall corporate strategy and vision.

  *   **Build vs. Buy Guideline:** For capabilities that **do not drive significant
  competitive advantage, buy the solution**. Reserve building or strategic partnership
  for areas that constitute the firm''s "secret sauce."

  *   **Partner Selection Criteria:** When choosing partners, look beyond technical
  systems integration expertise (vertical/industry knowledge). Crucially, assess their
  **horizontal expertise in human-side change management** to ensure adoption across
  the workforce.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Zarr Toolan (Edward Jones):** The featured expert, providing practical insights
  from a major individual investor-focused financial services firm.

  *   **Emerge AI Research:** The host organization, which conducts executive surveys
  and hosts thought leaders like the CIO of Goldman Sachs.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is shifting into the **"Intelligence Age" or "Agent Age,"** which is
  predicted to be a faster and more massive transformation than the shift from the
  Information Age to the Internet Age. Success will depend on organizationsâ€™ ability
  to leverage data to create continuous feedback loops that improve processes and
  experiences, rather than just optimizing current states.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  **AI/Tech/General Business Professionals** in highly regulated industries, particularly
  **Financial Services Executives, CIOs, CDOs, and AI Strategy Leaders** responsible
  for scaling AI adoption and managing governance risks.


  ---


  ### Comprehensive Summary


  Zarr Toolan of Edward Jones provided a strategic roadmap for embedding AI into the
  core of financial services operations, moving beyond pilot purgatory. He identified
  two primary reasons AI initiatives stall: **lack of direct alignment with corporate
  strategy** and the failure to establish clear **guiding principles** for utilization.


  Toolan outlined five essential guiding principles for responsible AI: **Human-Centeredness,
  Accountability, Transparency, Trustworthiness, and Inclusivity.** These principles
  are crucial for navigating regulatory scrutiny and building user confidence, especially
  as agentic systems become more prevalent.


  The discussion then pivoted to the **Build vs. Buy vs. Partner** dilemma. Toolan
  stressed that this decision must be rooted in data and model governance. He advocated
  for a pragmatic approach: buy commodity functions, and build or partner strategically
  for proprietary competitive advantages. He used the analogy of the "Peloton," urging
  firms to stay in the lead pack by leveraging established platforms for the 70% of
  needs, while focusing internal resources on the differentiating 30%.


  Perhaps the most significant theme was the **human element of AI adoption**. Toolan
  argued that firms over-index on the **tool set** (technology) and under-index on
  **mindsets and skill sets**. Successful adoption requires making AI an exceptional,
  seamless experience *in the flow of work*â€”ideally, users shouldn''t even realize
  they are using AI on the front end. He emphasized the need to focus change management
  efforts on the "movable middle" (70-80% of the workforce) to drive mass adoption.


  Finally, Toolan addressed talent strategy, advocating for a portfolio approach (full-time,
  contingent, offshore) based on role duration and required skill sets for the next
  2-3 years. A critical component of this strategy is **knowledge transfer**â€”systematically
  downloading tribal knowledge from long-tenured employees into scalable training
  and AI systems to bridge onboarding gaps for new talent, regardless of their employment
  status. Ultimately, the conversation underscored that data quality remains the single
  biggest barrier across all industries, and mastering data architecture is the key
  to unlocking sustainable AI outcomes.'
