    This is one of the biggest misconceptions about Bitcoin. It is a safe haven asset.
    People go to it, but in moments of crisis, like not over in a three-month crisis,
    right? Because that is when Bitcoin actually does pretty well. But in the reaction
    to news, Bitcoin is a very, very liquid market. And because Bitcoin is a very
    liquid market, people panic. News breaks, sell. What do you sell? What is liquid?
    What is open? Bitcoin is the only thing available to sell.

    argument for Bitcoin inclusion, highlighting its unique risk-adjusted return profile
    (high Sharpe, low correlation, asymmetry).

    Bitcoin''s full maturity: central bank and major corporate balance sheet adoption.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: central banks, they are not willing to bet on it yet. Most financial institutions
    do not hold Bitcoin on their balance sheet yet. Most public companies do not hold
    Bitcoin on their balance sheet yet. And so it is more mature than it was, but
    we are not an adult yet.
  topic: adoption/regulation

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Bitcoin’s $10K Candles Are Coming — Get Ready
  | Anthony & John Pompliano


  This 50-minute episode of the Pom Podcast, featuring Anthony Pompliano and John
  Pompliano, centers on analyzing recent market volatility, particularly in Bitcoin,
  and arguing against the prevailing narrative of an impending stock market crash
  or bubble. The core thesis is that structural changes in monetary policy and investor
  behavior support continued asset appreciation, despite short-term geopolitical noise.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area:**

  The primary focus is **Cryptocurrency Markets (Bitcoin)**, analyzed through the
  lens of **Macroeconomics, Geopolitics, and Traditional Equity Markets (Stocks)**.
  Key themes include market reflexivity, the impact of Federal Reserve policy, and
  the evolving definition of "value investing" in the tech era.


  **2. Key Technical Insights:**

  *   **Liquidity Clearing Event:** The recent $19 billion in Bitcoin liquidations
  served to "wipe out all the excess leverage," which is viewed as a necessary cleansing
  event that clears the path for higher prices.

  *   **24/7 Market Advantage:** Geopolitical events occurring outside of traditional
  stock market hours highlight Bitcoin''s 24/7 trading nature, driving more global
  participants to seek non-stop liquidity.

  *   **Dollar vs. Percentage Moves:** The market vernacular is shifting; while percentage
  moves in Bitcoin might seem small, the **aggregate dollar amount** of daily moves
  (e.g., $10K to $20K) will increase as the asset matures, requiring investors to
  adjust their perception of volatility.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle:**

  *   **Pessimism is Misplaced:** The hosts argue that the market is not in a bubble
  because too many respected figures (like Howard Marks) are still cautious, suggesting
  the true frothiness has not yet arrived.

  *   **Fed Backstop:** The Federal Reserve''s playbook, established post-2008, ensures
  that any significant bear market (defined as 18+ months) will be aggressively countered
  with monetary stimulus (rate cuts, QE), preventing prolonged downturns.

  *   **Retail "Buy the Dip" Reflexivity:** The current generation of retail investors
  understands market reflexivity—the faster an asset falls, the faster it rebounds—making
  "buying the dip" an exceptionally effective short-term strategy.


  **4. Notable Companies/People:**

  *   **President Trump:** Mentioned for his use of social media and geopolitical
  announcements (e.g., tariff threats) to manipulate market conversation and negotiate
  leverage, often timing announcements around market open/close.

  *   **Jamie Dimon:** Cited as an example of a major traditional finance figure acknowledging
  the current environment as a bull market.

  *   **Howard Marks (Oaktree):** Referenced for his recent comments suggesting he
  is not worried about a crash or bubble, signaling a shift even among established
  value investors.

  *   **Palantir:** Used as a prime example of modern corporate efficiency, where
  CEOs are now prioritizing revenue growth *per employee* rather than simply hiring
  volume.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  *   The discussion heavily implies that **Fed intervention and monetary policy**
  are the dominant forces shaping asset prices. The post-2008 "QE playbook" is now
  the default mechanism to prevent deep recessions, favoring asset owners over the
  lower socioeconomic classes.

  *   The hosts note that traditional markets are "manipulated by hours of operations"
  and "circuit breakers," contrasting this with Bitcoin''s "pure market" structure.


  **6. Future Implications:**

  Bitcoin is seen as maturing but not yet an "adult" asset. It is currently in its
  "teenage years," lacking the full trust of central banks and major institutions
  required to reach the $10 trillion market cap threshold associated with true financial
  maturity. The future involves increasingly large dollar-denominated price swings
  and a continued shift toward 24/7, globally accessible markets.


  **7. Target Audience:**

  This episode is most valuable for **Active Crypto Investors, Institutional Analysts,
  and Macro Strategists** who need to reconcile short-term geopolitical volatility
  with long-term structural trends in monetary policy and asset valuation.'
