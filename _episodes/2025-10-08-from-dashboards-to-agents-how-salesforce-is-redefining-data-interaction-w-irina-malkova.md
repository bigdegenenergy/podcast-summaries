    critical for *all* companies engaging in AI development, not just those with existing
    recommender systems.

  text: I do think that just like companies who build their recommenders realize that
    telemetry is very valuable, all companies building AI, which is like all of them
    if you read read link that would some realize that telemetry is very important.
  topic: AI/ML trends
- impact_reason: 'A powerful argument for agent adoption: agents deliver actionable
    answers directly into the flow of work (Slack), overcoming the latency and complexity
    issues inherent in traditional dashboards for time-constrained users.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We are actually finding a lot of value in replacing what used to be a dashboard
    with a conversational agent in Slack because dashboards are difficult to read,
    especially for a very technical area and that is not something that customer facing
    folks can afford to do. They are very, very short on time.

- impact_reason: 'A concrete example of an AI agent''s value proposition: transforming
    raw data display (dashboard) into actionable, context-aware recommendations.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We created the first ever what we call product growth agent. It is a very
    simple conversational agent that allows you to ask questions. How do you grow
    adoption of a certain product and it connects the same exact dashboard that we
    had before. It just provides a recommendation rather than just showing you the
    numbers.
  topic: AI/ML products
- impact_reason: Provides empirical validation for the superiority of agent-based
    data delivery over traditional dashboards, suggesting a measurable ROI difference.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: That really was a hit. That was the first time when we could apples to apples
    compare the value of data surface through a dashboard to the value of data surface
    through an agent. And the difference was undeniable.
  topic: business
- impact_reason: This detailed example illustrates the extreme cognitive load and
    complexity of enterprise decision-making based on siloed, tabular data, providing
    a perfect use case for AI agents to synthesize complex logic.

  text: it is selling our protocol Data Cloud that is the same one that I was saying
    we are using really heavily before it is so using credits so it has many different
    meters many different things you can buy you can buy more data you can buy more
    API calls etc. And then it is a new product that sells for sell so there were
    older versions that do not give you access to that correctly so sometimes when
    you want to buy more Data Cloud you first you need to change your skew so it is
    sold by sellers so sellers that sell it they are pre technical but they are still
    salespeople so their goal eventually is to provide a quote to the customer suggesting
    how much Data Cloud should this customer buy to be successful and figuring that
    out from just our dashboards required a PhD because there was a separate dashboard
    forecasting how much Data Cloud by meter would this customer need for a specific
    use case that already required a PhD just in itself
  topic: business/limitations
- impact_reason: This is a powerful description of how expert human reasoning (encoded
    as a graph/rules) can be successfully operationalized into an AI agent, directly
    addressing the inference gap.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: what every single salesperson had to do is take on a cognitive load of going
    from a data point to inference on what this means for them. That is what we were
    able to encode for them because that is when my director of analytics who owns
    that that whole area she just sat down and she drew a giant graph that went like
    if this matrix is like this I would do this and then I would look at the other
    dashboard and I would make this decision based on this metric so with an event
    took that graph and we essentially encoded it into instructions for the agent.
  topic: technical/strategy
- impact_reason: This explicitly links the success of the agent to encoding expert
    knowledge, and crucially, highlights the realization that knowledge graphs are
    fundamental infrastructure for advanced AI agents.

    to do with AI here
  topic: technical/strategy
- impact_reason: 'This provides a critical diagnosis for the limitations of standard
    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in enterprise settings: performance degrades
    significantly with dense, proprietary corpora.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: what how graphs came back from my point of view is RAG stopped working so
    what essentially happened is that when RAG was on public internet data I am assuming
    it worked well enough for the first use case to get off the ground... but then
    when you start putting corporate unstructured data into into the RAG performance
    dropped
  topic: technical/limitations
- impact_reason: 'This explains *why* RAG fails in enterprise: high entity density
    leads to poor semantic differentiation, making vector search insufficient for
    nuanced queries.'
  relevance_score: 10

  text: the standard RAG algorithm that relies on the the semantics similarity and
    the vector search it breaks when you have very dense corpus. For example if on
    the internet there are papers about I do not know dollars loving numbers and letters
    and then there are papers about politics like this clearly to like there are about
    two different things. Classic enterprise corpus of documents for example that
    Salesforce talks about Sales Cloud in every single document so good luck trying
    to differentiate between two different documents asking for nuance about how to
    use Sales Cloud on this contact
  topic: technical/limitations
- impact_reason: This positions Graph RAG as the necessary evolution to overcome the
    density challenge in enterprise unstructured data retrieval, marking a key technical
    trend.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: it is really it is the dimension there that separates things seems to be the
    density of entities within that corpus and that is really where the graphs come
    in and I think it is graph RAG being an improvement over standard RAG on the entity
    dense corpus was the first thing that enterprises went to for unstructured data
  topic: technical/breakthroughs

    a lot of movement in the vendors based on the pieces like that maybe so maybe
    not all the way to the agents running the world yet but a lot of movement in these
    underlying important pieces of time. I do not think agents are going to run the
    world until you fix these foundational things that did not going to happen.
  topic: predictions/strategy

    Agents inherently operate across functional silos (customer lens), exposing the
    lack of a common data layer as a critical strategic failure.

    suddenly take us to a place where we can hard measure the impact just like product
    folks measure the adoption of theirs and they can maybe test via data people can
    do the same.
  topic: technical/strategy
- impact_reason: Defines the data team's strategic value as holding the 'anthology'
    (the conceptual map) of the entire enterprise, which is essential for defining
    metrics and levers that AI systems need to optimize.
  relevance_score: 10

    is that every enterprise now needs to figure out what their processes are what
    is important to them what are the concepts that met that what is their growth
    model what things adapt to having more revenue less revenue where the levers on

  topic: strategy

    metrics and processes. Data teams are forced to impose structure (''make a dashboard
    out of it'') on this chaos, effectively defining the business reality.'

    nebulous bunch of humans making decisions and things just somehow magically working
    not every enterprise has a very detailed map of metrics that matter the world

summary: '## Podcast Summary: From Dashboards to Agents: How Salesforce is Redefining
  Data Interaction w/ Irina Malkova


  This episode features Irina Malkova, who leads a product data team at Salesforce,
  discussing the evolution of data interaction within the enterprise, moving from
  traditional dashboards to sophisticated, conversational AI agents, and the critical
  role of product telemetry and knowledge graphs in this shift.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area:**

  The primary focus is the **transformation of enterprise data consumption and decision-making**
  driven by Generative AI. Key themes include the shift from static Business Intelligence
  (BI) dashboards to **conversational AI agents** embedded directly into workflows
  (like Slack), the strategic importance of **product telemetry** (data emanating
  from product usage), and the necessary technical underpinning provided by **Knowledge
  Graphs** to overcome limitations in standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
  systems within dense corporate data environments.


  **2. Key Technical Insights:**

  *   **Product Telemetry Expansion:** Telemetry has evolved from purely engineering
  observability (error logging) to a crucial data source for ML/AI, especially recommendation
  systems and internal productivity tools, as every company digitizes further.

  *   **The Dashboard-to-Agent Transition:** Agents offer superior data interaction
  by moving insights directly into the user''s flow of work (e.g., Slack), reducing
  the cognitive load associated with interpreting complex, multi-dimensional dashboards
  that often require specialized knowledge to decipher.

  *   **Graph RAG for Enterprise Data:** Standard RAG struggles with dense, entity-rich
  enterprise corpora (where core terms repeat frequently, obscuring nuance). **Graph
  RAG** emerges as a necessary improvement, leveraging the inherent graph structure
  of enterprise data relationships to provide more accurate, nuanced answers, particularly
  when dealing with complex data catalogs or documentation.


  **3. Business/Investment Angle:**

  *   **AI Adoption is Workflow Integration:** True enterprise AI value is realized
  when agents automate decisions and provide actionable advice directly within the
  user''s existing workflow, rather than requiring users to switch to a separate BI
  tool.

  *   **Data Activation Layer Necessity:** Tools like Salesforce Data Cloud are becoming
  essential as a "data activation layer" that unifies disparate data stores, enabling
  agents to orchestrate actions across the entire data landscape.

  *   **High Stakes in Enterprise AI:** Enterprise adoption is slow and incremental
  because the stakes are high—decisions made via AI can impact careers. Trust and
  demonstrable, measurable productivity gains are paramount.


  **4. Notable Companies/People:**

  *   **Irina Malkova (Salesforce):** Leads a product data team focused on building
  data infrastructure for product telemetry and enabling internal AI/ML experiences.

  *   **Salesforce Agent Force & Data Cloud:** Highlighted as the specific platform
  combination (orchestration system + data activation layer) enabling their internal
  agent development.

  *   **Architect Community (Salesforce):** Credited with helping reintroduce and
  champion the use of graph technologies within the organization.


  **5. Future Implications:**

  The industry is moving toward an **agentic enterprise** where data interaction is
  conversational and automated. While full organizational restructuring might be slow,
  significant, often unseen, productivity gains are already occurring due to faster
  learning curves (Malkova learned more this year than in the previous decade) and
  better tooling focused on semantics and retrieval. The future requires solving fundamental
  challenges in **semantics** and **retrieval** to make agents truly reliable across
  complex enterprise knowledge bases.


  **6. Target Audience:**

  This episode is highly valuable for **Data Leaders, AI/ML Engineers, Product Managers**
  overseeing internal tooling or customer-facing data products, and **Enterprise Architects**
  focused on modernizing data stacks and implementing GenAI solutions.'
