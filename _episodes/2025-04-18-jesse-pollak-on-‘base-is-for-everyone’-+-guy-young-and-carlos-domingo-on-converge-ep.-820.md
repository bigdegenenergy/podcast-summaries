    Arbitrum for your tech stack with Celestia's data availability layer. And I was
    wondering when you said about searching for your tech stack, what tech specs were
    you searching for or what problems were you trying to solve with that? Yeah, I
    can jump in and Carlos can add anything that you think. Yeah, I think for us,
    it's really trying to think about we already have an enormous asset base sitting
    with Athena at the moment and with Securitize. So I think you mentioned in the
    beginning, between ourselves, it's around $10 billion. And being able to take
    the existing critical mass that we have into a new environment in a very easy
    way for users to be able to come across without a huge amount of technical debt
    was a big consideration for us. So going to a new VM or anything else that was
    pushing the boundaries outside of the EVM was something that we couldn't consider
    in the beginning just because of where the bulk and the majority of our existing
    assets and applications actually sit. I think the second piece for us was just
    trying to get towards the tech stack that we felt A, worked out of the box now
    and actually have the level of performance that we required to run the applications
    that we need to right now, but B, was also able to be customized going forward

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Jesse Pollak on ‘Base Is for Everyone’ + Guy Young and
  Carlos Domingo on Converge - Ep. 820


  This episode of Unchained features a deep dive with **Jesse Pollak**, Head of Base
  and Coinbase Wallet, focusing on the controversy surrounding the "Base is for everyone"
  coin launch on Zora, and a subsequent discussion with **Guy Young and Carlos Domingo**
  about the Converge event.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Base''s strategy for creator monetization and on-chain
  marketing** using tokenization (specifically Zora Coins), contrasting this experimental
  approach with established crypto community norms. Secondary focus includes the broader
  implications of on-chain economic primitives and the future of decentralized social/creator
  economies.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Coins as a Primitive for Content Value:** Pollak argues that "coins" (simple
  tokenization via Zora) are a powerful, technology-agnostic primitive for capturing
  the value of content, shifting economic power from platforms to creators.

  *   **Evolution of Tokenization:** The discussion traces the evolution from NFTs
  (requiring collections) to Coins (tokenizing single pieces of content), suggesting
  this simplification is key to mass adoption for creators.

  *   **Integration of DEXs into Coinbase:** A future vision for Coinbase involves
  integrating Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) directly, moving toward a "list everything"
  philosophy to grant customers access to the entire global economy.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Creator Economy Shift:** The core investment thesis is that tokenizing content
  allows creators to capture value (e.g., via trading fees or ownership) that Web2
  platforms currently extract, creating a new positive-sum economic engine.

  *   **Market Volatility as a Feature:** The rapid pump and dump of the "Base is
  for everyone" coin is framed not as a failure or rug pull, but as a demonstration
  of a free market valuing ephemeral content, which is necessary chaos for learning.

  *   **Challenging Existing Norms:** Pollak explicitly rejects conforming to the
  "social standards" set by existing communities (like Pump.fun users) regarding token
  launches, arguing that boundary-pushing experimentation is necessary to onboard
  the next billion users.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jesse Pollak (Base/Coinbase Wallet):** Central figure defending Base''s experimental,
  on-chain marketing strategy.

  *   **Zora:** The platform facilitating the coin creation, which has shifted its
  focus entirely to coins over NFTs for content posting.

  *   **Pump.fun:** Mentioned in the context of its founder, Alan, criticizing Base''s
  launch for violating established "trench standards" for token launches.

  *   **Coinbase:** Reiterated its long-term goal to list all assets and integrate
  DEX functionality.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Insider Trading & Surveillance:** Pollak provided absolute certainty that
  no Coinbase or Base employees were involved in the pre-launch trading of the token,
  highlighting Coinbase’s rigorous internal trading surveillance systems, which they
  use to report potential misconduct to regulators.

  *   **Cultural Toxicity & Safety:** Pollak stressed the need to create "psychological
  safety" on Base for experimentation, contrasting this with the "cultural toxicity"
  on Crypto Twitter that demands conformity.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where **tokenization becomes the default method
  for valuing and monetizing individual pieces of digital content**, moving beyond
  the concept of long-term projects or aggregated memes. This requires working through
  the current cultural stigma associated with coins to achieve a truly open, creator-centric
  economy. The industry needs to embrace necessary chaos and experimentation to pave
  the way for mass adoption.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Web3 builders, product managers, marketing
  executives in crypto, ecosystem strategists, and investors** interested in the intersection
  of social media, creator tools, and on-chain economics, particularly those focused
  on the Ethereum L2 ecosystem (Base).'
