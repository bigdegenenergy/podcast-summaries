summary: It seems there might be some confusion here. The content you've provided
  is actually the lyrics to Rick Astley's song "Never Gonna Give You Up," not a transcript
  of an AI/ML podcast episode. Therefore, I can't create a summary of AI-related topics
  from this text. If you have a different text or a genuine AI/ML podcast transcript
  you'd like summarized, please provide that, and I'd be happy to help.
