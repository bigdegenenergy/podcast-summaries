summary: '## Podcast Summary: Ep 632: ChatGPT Apps: 3 Hands-on approaches to save
  time today


  This episode of the Everyday AI Show, hosted by Jordan Wilson, focuses on the practical
  utility and future implications of OpenAI''s newly released **ChatGPT Apps**, which
  embed native third-party experiences directly within the ChatGPT interface. The
  core narrative centers on eliminating "file finishing friction"—the time lost copying,
  pasting, and reformatting between ChatGPT and external applications—by integrating
  services like Spotify, Canva, and Figma directly into the chat UI.


  The host argues that while the initial rollout is imperfect (only seven apps available,
  and current exclusion of Business/Enterprise users), this shift toward interacting
  with websites via a chat UI represents the future of work, similar to the success
  of mobile app stores.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **practical application of ChatGPT Apps** (native
  third-party integrations within ChatGPT) to enhance productivity. Specific technologies
  discussed include multimodal interaction (text and computer vision), the difference
  between Apps, Connectors, and Custom GPTs, and live demonstrations using the **Canva**
  and **Figma** apps.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Native GUI Integration:** ChatGPT Apps are distinct from previous attempts
  (Plugins, GPTs) because they offer a native graphical user interface (GUI) embedded
  within the chat window, allowing users to interact with external services directly
  via natural language.

  *   **Multimodal Context Awareness:** The apps leverage the LLM''s multimodal capabilities,
  meaning they can process visual inputs (like an uploaded mind map image) and apply
  that context to the task within the third-party application (e.g., recreating the
  map in Figma).

  *   **Productivity Gains:** OpenAI internally reported a **70% productivity increase**
  when using these integrated apps compared to the traditional workflow of switching
  between windows and manually transferring data.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Ecosystem Play:** OpenAI is aggressively pursuing an ecosystem model, similar
  to Apple''s App Store, evidenced by the introduction of a new protocol to handle
  **in-chat financial transactions and checkouts**.

  *   **Revenue Potential:** The host predicts this could become a multi-billion dollar
  endeavor within the first year if successful, driven by potential transaction fees
  (speculated to be 20-30%) on commerce conducted within ChatGPT.

  *   **Market Validation:** The partnership with Walmart for in-chat shopping signals
  a strong push toward embedding commerce directly into the AI interaction layer.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **OpenAI:** The developer of the ChatGPT Apps, aiming to close the gap between
  AI output and final execution.

  *   **Jordan Wilson (Host):** Provides the analysis and live demonstrations.

  *   **Mentioned Apps:** Spotify, Zillow, **Canva**, **Figma**, Expedia, Booking.com,
  and **Coursera**.

  *   **NotebookLM:** Mentioned as the tool used to generate the source material (a
  mind map) for one of the demos.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests that the industry is moving toward a **"chat
  UI as a browser"** model, where users will increasingly manage complex tasks across
  multiple services without leaving the conversational interface. This will necessitate
  that all major software providers integrate deeply with leading LLM platforms to
  remain relevant.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI Practitioners, Business Leaders, and Power
  Users** who already rely heavily on ChatGPT and are looking for immediate, actionable
  strategies to integrate these new features into their daily workflows to boost efficiency.

  ### Comprehensive Narrative Summary


  The episode begins by identifying the "file finishing friction" that plagues current
  AI usage—the tedious process of moving finalized AI outputs into their final destination
  applications. Jordan Wilson introduces ChatGPT Apps as OpenAI''s solution to this
  problem, positioning them as a significant step toward the future of work where
  users interact with external websites via a chat UI.


  Wilson differentiates Apps from previous features: **Connectors** bring in enterprise
  data, and **Custom GPTs** are personalized versions of the model, whereas **Apps**
  are native, embedded GUIs for third-party services (like Canva or Coursera). He
  notes that this is OpenAI''s third attempt to build an ecosystem, following the
  failure of Plugins and the relative stagnation of GPTs.


  A key point of discussion is the surprising availability of Apps to **free users**.
  Wilson explains this is strategic: OpenAI wants maximum adoption to test and refine
  the new **in-chat checkout protocol**, paving the way for future revenue generation
  through transaction fees, mirroring the success of mobile app stores.


  The bulk of the episode is dedicated to **three hands-on approaches** demonstrating
  immediate time savings:


  1.  **Bringing in Images/Elements (Multimodality):** A demo using the Figma app
  showed how uploading a mind map image (generated in NotebookLM) allowed ChatGPT
  to analyze the visual structure via computer vision and recreate the entire diagram
  vertically with new color schemes, saving hours of manual design work.

  2.  **Enriching Starting Points with Connectors:** This was partially demonstrated
  in the Coursera example, where prior research context was established.

  3.  **Giving Personal/Professional Context:** The host set a specific persona (expert
  in AI, learning neural networks, needing 90s basketball analogies). When asking
  for a Coursera course on neural networks, ChatGPT correctly surfaced the Coursera
  app, embedded the course player, and—crucially—**retained the established context**
  when asked follow-up questions about the course content, even integrating the requested
  niche analogy.


  Wilson concludes that while the current selection of seven apps is limited, users
  must start practicing with them now, as this integrated, context-aware interaction
