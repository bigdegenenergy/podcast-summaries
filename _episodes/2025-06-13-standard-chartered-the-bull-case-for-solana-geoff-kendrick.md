    and tokenized equities as the logical next step for chains like Solana, leveraging
    the stress-tested infrastructure.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Another even more positive version of the story would be we've had meme coins,
    they have tested the rails in Solana. They've had very high transaction volumes,
    etc., very, very quick, cheap stuff. And the other things that should lend themselves
    to Solana could come together more quickly. And there I'm thinking like social,
    for example. I'm thinking like tokenized equities, something like that.
  topic: Technology/Adoption
- impact_reason: Defines a key on-chain metric ('Application Fees Paid' or 'On-Chain
    GDP') as a superior measure of network utility compared to simple transaction
    count.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: When I look at activity on-chain, and the best measure I think is the total
    fees paid to the applications. So these end users pay the applications that are
    built on, in this case, Solana. You add those together. Some people include myself
    a starter call that GDP as a measure.
  topic: Technology/Valuation
- impact_reason: Quantifies the 'meme coin discount'—the market is pricing Solana

    more established use cases.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So like best part of 100% meme coin trading activity is not able to sustain
    the Solana price to where it could have been. If it had have had the same sort
    of PE type measure as you had on other chains, we would have gone a lot higher
    actually all this year.

    revenue) for L1s, contrasting it with traditional fee-based metrics.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: your preferred metric for valuing smart contract blockchains is what you call
    GDP, which is basically just the combined app revenue on these chains.
  topic: Investment/Strategy
- impact_reason: Provides a powerful analogy comparing L1s to sovereign nations, framing
    application fees as 'taxes' and net issuance as the 'government deficit,' offering
    a deep strategic framework for analysis.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: if you think about blockchains as being their own countries or their own cities...
    the fees paid on applications as kind of like a metric, which is interesting.
    And then you think about as that rolls up to the overall chain, and as fees and
    stuff like that, the net token issuance, which is essentially equivalent to like
    a government deficit type measure, will be impacted by the fees that are generated,
    which is kind of like taxes in the country, country system.
  topic: Strategy/Technology
- impact_reason: Suggests that current L1 valuations might be inflated because application
    value capture (and thus L1 fee capture) is not yet mature, predicting a potential
    shift where L1 premiums decrease as apps capture more value.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I suspect there's an overtime question here because blockchains are new...
    over time, particularly if take rates change on applications... at that point,
    you'll also then start to think about should layer ones have the premium that
    they have today?
  topic: Investment/Strategy
- impact_reason: Highlights the current economic imbalance where L2s capture significant
    value while paying minimal fees back to the L1 (Ethereum), suggesting this structure
    is unsustainable or mispriced.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you do the same type of metrics for the layer twos, who quite frankly are
    completely minting it from a cash perspective, paying Ethereum almost nothing
    and taking quite a bit for themselves. If you do those metrics, they are totally
    different levels.
  topic: Technology/DeFi
- impact_reason: 'A profound observation on value accrual: currently, L1s capture
    most market cap value, mirroring a centralized platform (Apple) where the platform
    captures value over the apps, which contradicts the decentralized ethos.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Layer ones actually probably come off a lot and application prices go up a
    lot. Like if we step back and sort of look at where value lies, it's been remarkably
    stable that the layer ones have captured all the value in a market cap sense right
    through. So it's sort of like saying in your, I don't know, like in your phone,
    iOS or Apple gets all the value and the applications built on it get zero.
  topic: Strategy/Web3
- impact_reason: 'Articulates the fundamental tension in L1 economics: L1s enable
    apps, but successful apps often capture value away from the L1, a key strategic
    challenge for all L1s.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's sort of, it feels a bit circular to me, right? So you have, as in most
    technologies, you have the application, sorry, the layer one gets built, then
    applications get built on top. Their value was enabled by the layer one, but then
    when applications get large enough, they kind of create all the value in the ecosystem.
    And so then you get a little bit of a breakout down the track.

  topic: investment
- impact_reason: Pinpoints the Dencun upgrade and blob space expansion as the mechanism
    causing value leakage from Ethereum L1 to L2s, framing it as a 'mismanagement'
    of value capture.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Dencun upgraded much last year, which gave power to the Layer 2s. And actually
    even just the Picture upgrade, which at the margin gave even more power to the
    Layer 2s by increasing blob space. So there's a multi-year value capture problem,
    which feeds back to your point before about fees mattering, which I think has
    been mismanaged by Ethereum.
  topic: technology/defi
- impact_reason: Poses a critical existential question for Solana regarding its core
    utility beyond speculative activity, suggesting its narrative is currently weaker
    than Ethereum's.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So Solana is in this space, which is what is the chain actually for? What's
    it about? And in a relative sense, that feels more tricky for me for the next
    two or three years than even the Ethereum story...
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: Identifies US stablecoin regulation as a potential 'lucky win' catalyst
    that could disproportionately benefit Ethereum due to its existing stablecoin
    dominance (Tether/Circle).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There could be a lucky win as well for Ethereum that could come at the same
    time, which is the only use case that is existing from the real world in crypto
    so far, which is stablecoins, like in scale... I think once you get legislation
    change in the US, the GENS Act or the Stable Act, whichever one comes through...
    Ethereum continues to dominate in stablecoins, it continues to dominate in tokenized
    real-world assets for now, like in scale.
  topic: regulation/adoption
- impact_reason: 'This provides a clear, tiered hierarchy of mainstream awareness:
    Bitcoin (universal awareness), Ethereum (banking sector awareness), and Solana
    (niche awareness within the banking sector, likely driven by trading activity/performance).'
  relevance_score: 10

  text: So everyone's heard of Bitcoin, like every person on the street, and every
    person that works in a bank has heard of Ethereum, and then like 5% of those in

  topic: Investment/Valuation

    (meme coins) must transition to sustainable utility.

  text: It also feels like some of the layer ones are at perhaps quite an interesting
    turning point in 2025. And for Solana, if, you know, obviously we're going to

    obviously that's been driving activity.

    from speculative activity to real-world, high-volume use cases.

    sustainable utility beyond speculative trading.'

  text: On the negative side, you would say we could now be in a space where we've
    had meme coins and there's nothing that's going to replace them.
  topic: Investment/Risk Analysis
- impact_reason: Describes a likely 'frustration phase' where price appreciation slows
    down as the market waits for utility adoption to catch up to infrastructure capability.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I would like to now create a bridge to the next use cases, which are high
    turnover, fast sectors like social or my equity token as equity example. But that
    could take time. So markets may be a little frustrated, etc. So that clearly comes
    a bit lower, and therefore, perhaps prices underperform while still going higher.
  topic: Market Trends/Strategy
- impact_reason: Provides concrete, recent data showing that meme coin volume has
    not collapsed, but rather established a new, higher baseline floor, challenging
    the narrative of immediate unsustainability.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Meme coin trading volume has increased each of the past three months from
    a low of $45 billion in March to $75 billion in May... So it's like the floor
    today is the ceiling of mid-2024.
  topic: Market Trends/Data
- impact_reason: Suggests that despite high activity, the market is applying a significant
    valuation discount to Solana compared to peers like Ethereum, perhaps due to perceived
    risk or narrative uncertainty.
  relevance_score: 9

    low-cost financial applications, likely due to speed and cost advantages.

    more so than Ethereum or Layer 2s.

- impact_reason: Contrasts Ethereum's current trust advantage with Solana's technical
    suitability for mass-market, low-value transactions, suggesting a future split
    in use cases.

  text: TradFi trusts Ethereum, they understand it, etc. But over time, if you need
    something that's faster and cheaper and quite frankly can get it done and is great
    for very low transaction size, it's sort of tokenized equities for retail investors
    in Thailand. Solana makes a lot of sense.
  topic: Technology/Adoption
- impact_reason: Argues for the utility of the Market Cap/App Revenue ratio because
    it produces comparable valuation figures across different L1s, similar to P/E
    ratios in equities.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: when you do this market cap divide annual as GDP measure that I'm talking
    about, you get similar numbers... So I feel like you can then do a little bit
    of an apples-to-apples across blockchains, which is extremely helpful.
  topic: Investment/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Presents a counter-argument: high app revenue doesn''t guarantee
    high value capture for the L1 if the app''s take rate is low or if the L1 doesn''t
    capture sufficient value from the activity.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I don't necessarily see how like a market cap to app revenue ratio is like
    a fair ratio to take because... it's not necessarily the case that the apps...
    have a really high take rate and then settle very little data to Solana.

    to applications—and notes that current market capitalization structures have not
    yet realized this potential.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: in blockchain space, that's not really possible. And it's kind of the whole
    point of blockchain, right? Is that value should get passed down or kept by the
    applications. We just haven't quite got there yet, at least in market cap.
  topic: Web3/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Outlines Solana''s strategic imperative: to maintain dominance,
    it must leverage composability and shared state to overcome the incentive for
    applications to fork off onto their own L1s/L2s.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think Solana has to really make this global shared state vision very appealing
    and have like multiple breakout sectors where you would want to be directly composable
    because you're all on this ledger together on Solana. And if you go be on your
    own layer one, people can't move assets there very easily, and that's like a downside.

    double what it is today, but you think in the near term, Ethereum will outperform
    Solana, which is a hot take, Jeff, I must say...
  topic: investment
- impact_reason: Suggests Solana's recent strong performance was heavily reliant on
    temporary meme coin activity, implying a difficult period ahead without a new
    catalyst.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So Solana had a pretty sweet run, helped out by the meme coin trading to get
    actual activity rather than just hope. Now I think we're post that, as we mentioned
    before, post-peak meme coin trading activity.
  topic: adoption/investment
- impact_reason: Predicts that future 'altcoin seasons' will be muted or structured
    differently due to the dominance of institutional capital flowing primarily into
    BTC first.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think so I see this altcoin season being completely different to past ones.
    I think because the institutionalization of the asset class and the importance
    of institutional flows dominate so below BTC.
  topic: investment

    of be like if I was going to have like AI producers were going to have a massive

    AI, right? So in this case, it could be lucky that the sector that benefits Ethereum
    does well.

    is like super old, right? Sort of like the equivalent of my personal real age,

    for blockchain is similar to midlife crisis in the real world.

    based on the diversity and risk profile of their dominant applications (e.g.,
    Solana's meme coin concentration vs. Ethereum's diversity).

    you have the application, sorry, the layer one gets built, then applications get
    built on top. Their value was enabled by the layer one, but then when applications
    get large enough, they kind of create all the value in the ecosystem. And so then
    you get a little bit of a breakout down the track.

summary: '## Standard Chartered: The Bull Case For Solana | Geoff Kendrick - Podcast
  Summary


  This 49-minute episode features Jack Cubanek interviewing Geoff Kendrick, Head of
  Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered, focusing on the bank''s first-ever
  price forecast for Solana (SOL). The discussion moves beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum
  coverage to analyze Solana''s valuation methodology, its current reliance on meme
  coin activity, and its potential transition to broader, high-throughput applications.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**:

  The primary focus is the **valuation and future trajectory of the Solana Layer-1
  blockchain**. Key themes include:

  *   Methodology for valuing L1 tokens beyond immediate hype.

  *   The role and sustainability of meme coin-driven transaction volume.

  *   Identifying the next major use cases (social, tokenized equities) that could
  replace meme coin activity.

  *   Comparing Solana''s on-chain activity metrics against peers like Ethereum.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **GDP Metric for Valuation**: Kendrick champions using "GDP" (Total Fees Paid
  to Applications) as the most comparable metric for valuing L1s, arguing it allows
  for more consistent, "apples-to-apples" comparisons across chains (like comparing
  P/E ratios in equities).

  *   **Discounting Meme Coin Activity**: Markets appear to be heavily discounting
  Solana''s current activity, suggesting a lower probability assigned to the sustainability
  of its current meme coin-driven fee structure compared to chains with more diversified
  usage (like Ethereum).

  *   **Application vs. L1 Value Capture**: There is an acknowledgment that historically,
  L1s capture most of the market cap value, but in the long term, as applications
  mature (e.g., Uniswap), value capture should shift to the applications themselves,
  potentially reducing L1 premiums.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Price Forecast**: Standard Chartered projects SOL to reach **$275 by the end
  of 2025** and **$500 by the end of 2029** (Base Case).

  *   **Bull Case**: A massive acceleration in non-meme coin activity, such as tokenized
  equities or successful social applications, replacing meme coin volume could push
  the price significantly higher (e.g., $450 in the near term).

  *   **Bear Case**: If meme coin activity collapses without a viable replacement,
  Solana could be viewed as a "one-trick pony," leading to price stagnation or decline,
  though Kendrick views this as low probability.

  *   **Current State**: The market is currently in a "bridge" phase where high meme
  coin activity has subsided from peak highs, and the market awaits the next wave
  of sustainable use cases.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Geoff Kendrick (Standard Chartered)**: The analyst providing the valuation
  framework and price targets.

  *   **Solana (SOL)**: The primary asset under review, noted for its high throughput
  and low transaction costs.

  *   **Ethereum (ETH)**: Used as a primary comparison point for valuation metrics
  and application diversity.

  *   **pump.fun & Radium**: Mentioned as key platforms driving Solana''s meme coin
  trading activity.

  *   **Ledger**: The episode sponsor, highlighted for securing SOL and SPL tokens
  via hardware wallets.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   No direct, in-depth regulatory discussion occurred, though the conversation
  touched upon the potential for **tokenized equities** to gain traction, which would
  inherently involve significant regulatory oversight in traditional finance (TradFi).


  **6. Future Implications**:

  The conversation suggests the industry is heading toward a point where L1s must
  prove utility beyond speculative trading. Solana’s future success hinges on its
  ability to attract high-volume, low-transaction-size financial services (like tokenized
  equities for global retail access) or successful social applications to create a
  durable economic moat against competitors. Solana must make its shared global state
  highly appealing to prevent breakout applications from migrating to their own L2s
  or L1s to capture greater value.


  **7. Target Audience**:

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto Investors, Institutional Analysts, and
  Blockchain Strategists** focused on Layer-1 tokenomics, comparative blockchain valuation,
  and the long-term utility drivers for high-speed networks.'
