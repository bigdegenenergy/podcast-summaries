summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Keeping the Patient Voice in De-Identified Data
  Models - with Brad Kennedy of Orlando Health


  This 24-minute episode of the AI and Business Podcast, featuring Brad Kennedy, Senior
  Director of Business Solutions Strategy at Orlando Health, focuses on the critical
  implementation challenges and strategic considerations for deploying AI within complex
  healthcare environments, emphasizing the necessity of maintaining the patient voice
  and achieving measurable clinical and operational value.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **AI implementation strategy in healthcare**, specifically
  addressing the intersection of **patient experience, clinical workflow integration,
  technology adoption hurdles (especially physician skepticism), and the strategic
  validation of new AI tools** (including Generative AI and emerging Agentic AI) against
  quantifiable outcomes.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Clinical Decision Support (CDS) over Automation:** The most promising current
  application for AI in healthcare is providing precise CDS by synthesizing numerous
  patient factors into quick recommendations, which the physician must then validate,
  ensuring AI *supports* rather than *replaces* physician judgment.

  *   **Agentic AI Potential:** Agentic systems are anticipated to offer opportunities
  for rolling out new algorithms that enhance diagnostic precision and speed up complex
  analysis, provided they are carefully governed to avoid autonomous decision-making
  regarding patient care.

  *   **Data Modeling Nuance (Implied):** While the title mentions de-identified data
  models, the conversation heavily implies that successful AI relies on understanding
  the *context* of patient experience data (like HCAP scores) to drive meaningful
  algorithmic improvements, suggesting a need for rich, contextualized data inputs
  beyond simple de-identification.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Value-Based Care Driver:** Patient experience (tracked via CMS HCAP surveys
  and star ratings) is no longer just a satisfaction metric; it is increasingly tied
  to revenue under the shift from fee-for-service to value-based care contracts.

  *   **Quantifiable ROI is Mandatory:** Any proposed technology or change, including
  AI pilots, must be supported by a robust business case that clearly quantifies the
  expected improvements in experience, outcomes, or efficiency to gain buy-in from
  clinical, IT, and legal stakeholders.

  *   **Adoption hinges on "What''s In It For Me" (WIIFM):** Investment success is
  directly linked to demonstrating tangible benefits for the end-users—providers and
  nurses—by showing how the technology improves their workflow efficiency or patient
  care precision, rather than just abstract benefits.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Brad Kennedy (Orlando Health):** The key expert, providing real-world insights
  from his background in patient experience strategy and innovation leadership within
  a major health system.

  *   **CMS (Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services):** Mentioned as the key driver
  behind formalizing patient experience accountability through the **HCAP survey**
  system, which links public ratings to hospital performance.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a future where AI is deeply embedded as a **clinical
  support layer**, accelerating diagnosis and treatment planning. However, the success
  of this integration hinges on overcoming significant **trust barriers** (both clinician
  and patient skepticism regarding automated systems) and ensuring that new technologies,
  like Agentic AI, are built collaboratively with frontline staff to avoid increasing
  provider burden.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Healthcare Executives, Clinical Informatics
  Leaders, AI Strategy Officers, and Health System Innovation Teams** who are responsible
  for vetting, funding, and deploying new technologies while navigating regulatory
  environments and clinical adoption challenges.'
