  text: But the star of the show, the one that Mark opened with, with a live stream
    from the glasses, are these Ray-Bans with a screen. Basically, they're Ray-Bans
    display, and they've got a little— is it a 600 by 600 kind of thumbnail-sized
    display within the lens. It's super bright. A nit is actually a unit of measurement
    for how much light something can emit, but it's 5,000 nits, which translates to—

    like it is not just us making stuff and setting out into the world. The goal is
    going to be that people are out there and they will want to do these on their
    own, too. The tools will not be there day one, but our plan across the board is

- impact_reason: Suggests that technology adoption and perception (like AI content)
    are heavily influenced by generational cohorts, impacting long-term market acceptance.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think it will be generational, which we have said before. Like, the idea
    that generations are going to define how they're using technology. I said this
    about AI slop a while ago, like that 15-year-olds don't think of it as AI slop.
    They just think about as content that they can make and do stuff with.

    difficult onboarding process to Codex where you're having to figure out the exact

    and permissions to do the things that you want to do.
  topic: technology

    direct competition with Anthropic, driven by the high commercial value (MRR/valuation)
    of specialized coding AI tools.'
