    and 80% of stakers to twice different snapshots. So no mistakes happen, and then

    of different banking systems, no need for overnight settlement.

    hedge against dollar debasement, offering high growth *and* yield, a combination
    absent in traditional assets.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The value of the US dollar has been going down since 1970s... Solana is high
    growth because it's five times cheaper than Ethereum but has 30 times more transactions
    and users. And it's yielding, you know, 7% staking yield, and with DeFi, like
    10 to 12% plus. So a high-growth asset which yields 10% dividend per annum in

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why This Early Solana Investor Is Still All
  In | Viktor Fischer


  This 68-minute episode features an in-depth conversation with **Viktor Fischer**,
  founder and CEO of **Rockaway X**, an early and highly successful venture fund focused
  on the Solana ecosystem. Fischer details the firm''s origin story, their unwavering
  conviction in Solana since the seed stage (when SOL was $0.04), and their current,
  aggressive thesis for the network''s future, including ambitious price targets.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Solana''s technical viability, ecosystem development, and
  investment thesis**, contrasted against Ethereum. Secondary themes include the changing
  landscape of crypto venture capital, the influx of Traditional Finance (TradFi)
  investors, and the macroeconomic environment (fiat debasement).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Ecosystem Dominance over Performance:** Fischer argues that the "game is over"
  for new L1s because developer mindshare has consolidated around **Solana and Base**.
  The barrier to entry for a new L1 is no longer raw performance but the massive,
  multi-year effort required to secure exchange off-ramps, wallet support, and foundational
  DeFi primitives.

  *   **Solana''s Speed as an Application Builder:** Solana''s core technical advantage
  is its speed and low cost, which allows applications (like NFT minting tools) to
  be built and iterated upon extremely quickly, making it the preferred chain for
  rapid deployment.

  *   **Operational Maturity:** Following past network outages (like the mainnet snapshot
  issue), the community has implemented robust processes, such as avoiding mainnet
  upgrades, demonstrating a commitment to operational excellence and learning from
  mistakes.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **The End of 1000x L1 Bets:** The VC math has changed; achieving a $1 billion
  Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) is now considered a success for a new L1 investment,
  shifting the focus from massive early-stage multipliers to securing significant
  ownership stakes (e.g., 10% of FDV) in successful protocols.

  *   **TradFi Influx and the DAO Opportunity:** Fischer identifies a major current
  opportunity in onboarding TradFi investors via Solana-based DAOs (e.g., Ford, STS,
  Solvade). He notes a massive gap: Solana DAOs have only $110M-$120M in daily trading
  volume compared to over $3B on Ethereum DAOs.

  *   **Price Targets Anchored to Macro and Utility:** Fischer projects **SOL targets
  of $900 (matching ETH market cap), $2,000, and $6,000**. The $2,000 target is based
  on Solana capturing 10% of the projected $20-25 trillion global tokenized asset
  market by 2030.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Rockaway X:** Victor Fischer’s firm, an early investor in Solana, Camino,
  Squads, and Double Zero.

  *   **Solana Team (Toly & Raj):** Praised for their "never give up" attitude, which
  was crucial during lean times before the 2021 boom.

  *   **Dr. Arthur Laffer:** The inventor of the Laffer Curve, now a board member
  at Solvade, who bullishly views Solana as a "global NASDAQ" that offers instant,
  low-cost global settlement without overnight synchronization.

  *   **WiseSolana.com:** A resource Fischer created to simplify the Solana story
  for traditional investors.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched on the macroeconomic policy environment, specifically the
  expectation of **negative real interest rates** in the US (inflation running hotter
  than Fed rates). This environment, Fischer argues, forces investors to seek high-growth,
  yield-generating assets outside of traditional bonds and equities, benefiting crypto.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a duopoly of dominant L1s (Solana and Base) where
  ecosystem integration (wallets, exchanges) dictates success. The next major growth
  vector for Solana will be successfully integrating sophisticated TradFi capital
  through institutional-grade DAOs, positioning SOL not as "digital gold" but as a
  **high-growth, yield-generating asset** that improves traditional portfolio Sharpe
  ratios.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto VCs, Solana Ecosystem Builders, Institutional Investors looking for high-growth
  digital assets, and Macro Strategists** interested in how blockchain adoption intersects
  with global monetary policy.'
