  text: If you're too active in DeFi, if you're too active in rehypothecating your
    Solana, there's meaningful double taxation through a corporation.

    potential as foundational financial infrastructure, suggesting DeFi capacity is

summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - Pantera has been instrumental in structuring and anchoring over 15 DAT deals across
    crypto, positioning them as leaders in this emerging investment vehicle.
  - Helius (HSTT) is Pantera's dedicated effort to bring the successful DAT model,
    previously applied to ETH (like Bitwise), to Solana, which they view as their
    highest conviction investment.
  - 'The core investment thesis for Solana is its alignment with the ''holy trinity''
    of consumer wants: faster, cheaper, and more accessible, mirroring the success
    factors of Amazon.'
  - DATs justify a premium to Net Asset Value (NAV) if they can sustainably generate
    yield exceeding their cost of capital, primarily through financial engineering
    (issuing stock at a premium) and productive asset use (staking/DeFi).
  - Pantera believes the DAT market will consolidate, expecting 2-3 major winners
    per ecosystem, and they are prepared to acquire smaller DATs if they trade at
    a discount to NAV.
  - The primary focus for generating yield in the Solana DAT will be staking, leveraging
    Pantera's scale to secure differentiated, efficient terms with staking providers.
  - A key goal for Helius is to emulate the success of the Bitwise ETH DAT by aggressively
    marketing Solana to 'Main Street' retail and mainstream financial media, rather
    than just crypto natives.
  overview: Cosmo Jiang of Pantera Capital discusses the launch of Helius, a new Solana
    Digital Asset Treasury (DAT), emphasizing Pantera's deep conviction in Solana
    as the superior productive asset compared to Bitcoin. The conversation centers
    on the strategy behind DATs, drawing parallels to successful equity models, and
    how Helius aims to capture mainstream attention by telling Solana's compelling
    story of speed, low cost, and accessibility to traditional finance investors.
