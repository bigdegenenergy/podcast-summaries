    to ''smarter compliance'' enforced programmatically on-chain.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: One, you can start thinking about smarter compliance rather than an interpretation
    of compliance or manual compliance. So, there's no reason why KYC and AML cannot
    move on-chain, and you cannot enforce the rules programmatically, right?
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: 'This is a crucial regulatory insight: programmatic enforcement allows
    for broader participation (inclusion) while enabling targeted, efficient compliance
    checks at the point of use/redemption.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So, you make it permissionless, but in order to redeem, in order to use, in
    order to use as collateral for different products that are out there, you can
    enforce these programmatically, and it actually makes it easier, not harder. So,
    imagine a world where you let in more people, and then you can target rather than
    say, 'I'm just going to not let everyone participate in it.'

    change (''rewiring the back end''), not merely a superficial digital wrapper.'

summary: '## Podcast Summary: #1561 Arjun Sethi | Is Bitcoin Becoming the New Global
  Reserve Asset?


  This episode of the Pomp Podcast features Anthony Pompliano in conversation with
  **Arjun Sethi, Co-CEO of Kraken**, focusing on the convergence of traditional finance
  (TradFi) and the crypto ecosystem, and the fundamental shift towards programmable,
  permissionless financial infrastructure.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **future of global finance**, arguing that it will
  be **programmable, permissionless, and increasingly decentralized**. Key themes
  include:

  *   The convergence of TradFi and crypto (e.g., Robinhood adding crypto, Kraken
  adding US equities).

  *   Bitcoin and crypto as an **infrastructure layer** for global liquidity, not
  just an asset class.

  *   The role of **AI in finance** for creating leaner, faster systems.

  *   The importance of **tokenization** (moving real-world assets on-chain).

  *   The development of **hybrid trust models** between regulated entities and decentralized
  primitives.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Crypto as Infrastructure:** Crypto is fundamentally an infrastructure layer
  powering trading, payments, identity, custody, and credit, moving beyond being viewed
  solely as an asset class.

  *   **Programmatic Compliance:** KYC/AML compliance can and should move on-chain,
  enforced programmatically rather than through manual, post-facto interpretation,
  potentially making compliance easier and more targeted.

  *   **Composability and Interoperability:** The future requires protocol-level composability,
  similar to email, allowing seamless communication and asset transfer across different
  platforms (e.g., sending assets between Venmo and PayPal equivalents).


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Kraken’s Strategy:** Kraken is positioning itself as a "financial OS of the
  internet," building infrastructure for trading, custody, and payments to enable
  innovation rather than acting as a closed gatekeeper.

  *   **Tokenization as the Trojan Horse:** Tokenizing traditional assets (like Kraken’s
  X-stocks) is the key mechanism for bringing established assets onto programmable
  rails, unlocking innovation in DeFi lending and structured products.

  *   **Issuer Choice:** Issuers (companies) now have a choice between traditional
  public markets and tokenized on-chain strategies, which will drive competition between
  TradFi and crypto systems to win their business by offering better access to global
  liquidity and lower friction.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Arjun Sethi (Kraken Co-CEO):** The primary expert, detailing Kraken’s strategy
  to build open, programmable financial rails and integrate traditional assets.

  *   **Kraken:** Highlighted as a crypto-native company proactively building infrastructure
  to support traditional assets (X-stocks) and aiming to be a global financial OS.

  *   **Traditional Players (e.g., Fidelity, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley):** Mentioned
  as examples of existing systems where moving assets between providers is intentionally
  difficult due to friction.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The conversation acknowledged that regulations were often passed for good reasons
  but are poorly implemented in the manual, post-WWII framework. Sethi argues that
  the future involves **smarter, programmatic compliance** that enforces rules at
  the point of interaction (e.g., redemption or collateral use) rather than broad,
  manual gatekeeping that excludes billions of potential users.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward an **open, permissionless financial system** where
  asset ownership is user-owned (or hybrid), globally accessible, and natively digital.
  This shift will collapse layers of friction (custody, settlement, access) abstracted
  into code, leading to greater innovation and financial inclusion by lowering the
  barrier to entry for product development.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Financial Technology Professionals, Investment
  Strategists, Crypto Infrastructure Developers, and Institutional Investors** seeking
  deep insight into the long-term structural evolution of global capital markets driven
  by crypto and AI integration.'
