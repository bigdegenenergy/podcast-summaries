    it is almost impossible to do that in Europe. I need to go to Silicon Valley because
    the density of people who have done that scale, have served tens of millions of

    is where I stand.'' You know, suddenly the VCs were like, ''Yeah, we follow you.

summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: The Wild Story Raising $450M From Masa and Softbank
  with Johannes Reck (GetYourGuide)


  This episode of 20VC features Harry Stebbings in conversation with **Johannes Reck,
  Co-founder and CEO of GetYourGuide**, detailing the company''s extraordinary journey
  from five bookings in two years to processing 35,000 per day, culminating in a massive
  funding round from SoftBank. The discussion heavily contrasts the European and US
  startup ecosystems, focusing on capital availability, talent density, and the cultural
  mindset required for global scale.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **General Tech/E-commerce (Online Travel)**, with deep
  dives into **Venture Capital dynamics (US vs. Europe)**, **scaling challenges**,
  **founder psychology**, and **European competitiveness** in the global tech landscape.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Early Product Iteration & Pivots:** GetYourGuide pivoted three times in its
  early years (starting as a peer-to-peer guide community) before finding product-market
  fit by focusing on digitizing the massive, non-digital European experience provider
  market.

  *   **Talent Density Requirement:** Scaling to $10B+ valuations requires talent
  density (e.g., CPOs who have managed tens of millions of customers), which Reck
  argues is currently concentrated almost exclusively in Silicon Valley, necessitating
  international relocation for top roles.

  *   **Operationalizing Scale:** The shift from early-stage failure to growth required
  going "all-in," building online marketing functions, and establishing structures
  and processes necessary for massive scale, which cannot be done effectively on the
  side.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **US vs. European VC Dynamics:** US investors, having seen massive home runs
  (like Oculus, Palantir in SoftBank’s early fund), operate with less pressure, allowing
  founders to take bigger swings. European VCs often lack this track record, leading
  to different founder dynamics.

  *   **The Growth Capital Gap in Europe:** While Seed/Series A capital might be sufficient,
  Reck strongly argues that Europe suffers from a severe lack of **growth-stage capital
  (Series C, D, pre-IPO)**, making it nearly impossible for a German company to realistically
  consider a European public listing due to insufficient capital pools.

  *   **Valuation and Cost of Capital:** More innovation funding in Europe would lead
  to a lower cost of capital, resulting in higher valuations for growth-stage companies,
  which keeps successful businesses anchored in the region.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Johannes Reck & Tao (Co-founder):** Founders of GetYourGuide, whose initial
  idea stemmed from a poor travel experience in Beijing.

  *   **Masayoshi Son (Masa) & SoftBank:** Mentioned for the "wild story" of securing
  a $400M check, which included Masa’s famous Napoleon portrait in the background
  during meetings.

  *   **Sequoia Capital, Spark Capital:** Mentioned as examples of top-tier VCs whose
  presence significantly eases subsequent fundraising rounds due to the validation
  they provide.

  *   **Nico Rosberg (F1 Champion):** Quoted on the importance of focusing on the
  road (the goal) and not looking at the wall (failure).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Talent Attraction Policy:** Reck passionately advocates for Europe to seize
  the current moment (while the US is politically unstable) by aggressively attracting
  global talent through **massive tax incentives** (e.g., five years tax-free, no
  taxation on stock options) for skilled tech workers.

  *   **Bureaucracy as a Barrier:** The difficulty of securing basic immigration paperwork
  (e.g., a CTO from Netflix took six months and required intervention from the German
  Foreign Office for a visa appointment) highlights crippling bureaucratic barriers.

  *   **Civic Society Concerns:** The rise of the far-right in Europe is seen as a
  significant detractor for the global talent pool that Europe desperately needs.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The future of European tech hinges on its ability to **fund growth-stage companies**
  and **aggressively attract and retain global talent**. Reck believes governments
  are currently ill-equipped, making it the challenge for the current generation of
  founders and leaders to inject optimism and drive necessary structural change, particularly
  in investment allocation toward the younger generation.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Tech Founders (especially European), Venture Capitalists, Startup Ecosystem Builders,
  and Policy Makers** interested in global competitiveness, scaling businesses beyond
  Series B, and the structural differences between US and European funding markets.'
