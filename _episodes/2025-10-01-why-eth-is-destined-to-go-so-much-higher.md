summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why ETH Is Destined To Go So Much Higher


  This 80-minute episode of The Edge Podcast, featuring host DeFi Dad, Nomadic, and
  guest Ryan Berkman (an ETH investor), focuses on the fundamental strength, recent
  positive catalysts, and massive future potential of Ethereum (ETH), arguing that
  its price is significantly lagging its underlying value proposition.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Ethereum (ETH) as a foundational, civilizational infrastructure
  asset**. Key discussion areas include the recent positive shift in market sentiment,
  the maturation of network fundamentals, the strategic evolution of the Ethereum
  Foundation (EF), and the critical role of "Low-Risk DeFi" in driving global economic
  adoption.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Dencun Upgrade Catalyst:** The upcoming Dencun upgrade (slated for December
  3rd at the time of recording) is highlighted as a key technical catalyst, specifically
  focusing on its implications for Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions (likely via EIP-4844/blobs).

  *   **L2 Activity Benefits L1:** Growing activity on L2s is viewed as extremely
  positive for both the utility of the L1 base layer and ETH''s role as a store of
  value.

  *   **Scaling Strategy:** The EF''s current strategy is defined by three pillars:
  scaling L1 (including institutional adoption), scaling L2s (blobs), and improving
  User Experience (UX) through interoperability.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Strong Buy Thesis:** The core investment thesis is an unequivocal recommendation
  to **"Buy Ether,"** projecting a reliable 5x return over a 5-to-10-year horizon,
  suggesting ETH is destined for a multi-trillion dollar valuation regardless of short-term
  volatility.

  *   **Sentiment Shift:** The market has moved from extreme bearishness (April 2025,
  ETH near $1,500) to significant bullishness, driven by mainstream recognition of
  ETH''s value as digital treasury assets.

  *   **Low-Risk DeFi as Gateway:** The concept of "Low-Risk DeFi" (lending, under-collateralized
  loans, identity solutions) is identified as the critical pathway for Ethereum to
  capture global economic activity by minimizing friction and maximizing trust.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Ryan Berkman:** ETH investor and guest, providing the core bullish framework.

  *   **Joseph Lubin & Joseph Chaolam (BlackRock Alum):** Mentioned as key figures
  representing the new coalition of institutional and political support for Ethereum
  adoption.

  *   **Tom Lee:** Credited for effectively packaging and communicating key Ethereum
  talking points to Wall Street.

  *   **Vivek (The Defiant):** Praised for his early and effective messaging linking
  stablecoins to Ethereum''s trajectory.

  *   **The Defiant:** Highlighted as a "keystone" organization building products
  at the intersection of Wall Street, government, and cutting-edge Ethereum architecture.

  *   **Ethereum Foundation (EF):** Noted for a significant, positive evolution toward
  greater pragmatism, strategic execution, and cultural cohesion since April, focusing
  on scaling and UX.

  *   **Vitalik Buterin:** His recent embrace of "Low-Risk DeFi" (even acknowledging
  projects like TrueFi) signals a major shift in recognizing DeFi as the chain''s
  primary profit center and global adoption driver.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Stablecoin Embrace:** The discussion noted the "courageous" embrace of stablecoins
  by the new administration, viewing this as a positive catalyst because stablecoins
  represent on-chain US dollar dominance, aligning with American principles of permissionless
  innovation and property rights.

  *   **Political Diversity:** The rise of Digital Asset Treasury companies (DAOs)
  is seen as creating a new, politically diverse coalition ready to advocate for Ethereum
  in halls of power.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests Ethereum is evolving into **"civilizational infrastructure"**
  and the **"future of capitalism."** The industry is moving toward a phase where
  foundational applications like low-risk DeFi will onboard massive amounts of real-world
  economic activity, proving the value of decentralization and risk minimization on
  a global scale. The EF is becoming less central as new stakeholders (DAOs, Robinhood,
  Coinbase) take on leadership roles.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto/Web3 professionals, institutional investors,
  and long-term ETH holders** who need a deep, fundamental-driven argument for ETH''s
  continued appreciation, focusing on network strategy, technical roadmap, and macroeconomic
  positioning.'
