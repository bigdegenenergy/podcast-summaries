summary: '## Summary of AI and Business Podcast Episode with Brett Kiley (CVS Health)


  This episode of the AI and Business Podcast, featuring Brett Kiley, Executive Director
  of Customer Experience and Client Solutions at CVS Health, provided a deep dive
  into the strategic challenges and technological transformations occurring in customer
  experience (CX) within the complex retail and healthcare sectors. The core narrative
  focused on CVS Health''s journey to evolve from reactive problem-solving to proactive,
  hyper-personalized customer engagement amidst rising consumer expectations and significant
  regulatory oversight.


  **Key Discussion Points & Narrative Arc:**


  The conversation began by establishing the high bar set by modern consumers who
  demand **24/7 access** and **channel consistency** across communication modes (chat,
  text, phone). Kiley highlighted the challenge of **inconsistency** across channels
  and the constant pressure to match the seamless experiences offered by non-competitor
  industries. The discussion then pivoted to the overwhelming volume of **Voice of
  the Customer (VoC) data**—from social media to internal surveys like **Net Promoter
  Score (NPS)**—and the difficulty in synthesizing it effectively, especially when
  balancing speed (seen in non-regulated industries) against heavy **healthcare and
  financial regulation**. A major theme was eliminating **journey friction**, ensuring
  that when a customer escalates from a bot to a human or switches channels, they
  do not have to restart the interaction.


  **Major Topics and Technical Concepts:**


  * **Omnichannel Consistency & Journey Mapping:** Focus on creating end-to-end seamless
  experiences where context and information transfer correctly between automated and
  human touchpoints.

  * **Data Governance and Prioritization:** Moving beyond data overload by weighting
  characteristics (e.g., medication delivery timeliness matters more than geography)
  to inform operational strategy.

  * **Metrics and KPIs:** Critiquing traditional metrics like Average Handle Time
  (AHT) in favor of context-aware KPIs tied directly to NPS and patient satisfaction,
  acknowledging that longer calls can sometimes indicate better resolution.

  * **Proactive vs. Reactive Service:** A major strategic shift involving integrating
  demographic, interaction, and social data to anticipate needs rather than just responding
  to complaints.

  * **AI Application:** Practical uses of Natural Language AI for handling routine
  inquiries, thereby freeing human agents for complex issues, and leveraging AI for
  **hyper-personalization** at scale (moving from broad buckets to "two million different
  buckets").


  **Business Implications and Strategic Insights:**


  The strategic insight shared by Kiley is that superior CX is now the **battleground**
  for winning and transforming organizations, moving away from the perception of customer
  service as the "DMV." Proactive service generates loyalty and positive viral messaging,
  which is impossible in a purely reactive model. Furthermore, the ROI for proactive,
  data-informed interventions (even small ones, like thanking a loyal customer) is
  often positive almost immediately.


  **Challenges and Controversies Highlighted:**


  The primary challenges are navigating the **regulatory surface area** (which inherently
  adds friction) while simultaneously implementing new technologies. There is also
  the persistent **trust factor** associated with automation, where human oversight
  is still perceived as more trustworthy, particularly in sensitive healthcare contexts.
  The difficulty in selecting the *right* KPIs that accurately reflect quality over
  mere speed was also a significant point of contention.


  **Actionable Advice and Recommendations:**


  1. **Define Contextual KPIs:** Move beyond simple efficiency metrics (like AHT)
  and focus on drivers that align with regulatory requirements and core patient satisfaction
  goals.

  2. **Prioritize Seamless Handoffs:** Invest in technology that ensures context is
  maintained across all channels to eliminate customer effort (the need to repeat
  information).

  3. **Leverage AI for Scale and Complexity:** Use AI to automate routine tasks to
  enable human agents to focus on high-value, complex problem-solving, and use AI
  to achieve true hyper-personalization at massive scale.


  **Context and Industry Relevance:**


  This conversation is crucial for technology professionals because it illustrates
  how a massive, highly regulated entity like CVS Health is operationalizing AI and
  data science to meet consumer expectations set by frictionless tech giants. It underscores
  the necessity of balancing innovation speed with compliance, proving that strategic
  data governance and thoughtful KPI selection are prerequisites for successful digital
  transformation in CX.'
