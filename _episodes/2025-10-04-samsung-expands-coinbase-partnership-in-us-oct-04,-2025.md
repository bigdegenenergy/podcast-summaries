summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: "Samsung expands Coinbase partnership in US"
  (Oct 04, 2025)


  This 5-minute daily crypto report focuses on significant real-world adoption milestones
  in the US crypto space, driven by major corporate partnerships and regulatory tailwinds,
  while also covering key developments in DeFi security.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**:

  The primary focus is on **mainstream crypto adoption** driven by major technology
  and retail giants (Samsung, Walmart/OnePay), the integration of digital assets into
  traditional financial rails, and security updates within specific Layer-2 ecosystems
  (Shibarium).


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Samsung Pay as a Funding Rail:** Samsung has integrated Samsung Pay directly
  into the Coinbase app, establishing a seamless, built-in funding mechanism for Coinbase
  accounts using existing Galaxy phone infrastructure.

  *   **ZeroHash Infrastructure:** Walmart-backed OnePay''s planned crypto integration
  (Bitcoin/Ether trading and custody) is being powered by the crypto infrastructure
  firm ZeroHash, highlighting the growing reliance on specialized B2B crypto service
  providers.

  *   **Shibarium Exploit Remediation:** Shibarium developers successfully rotated
  all validator keys and moved over 100 contracts to secure wallets following a $4
  million exploit, demonstrating rapid response and recovery protocols for L2 security
  incidents.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Retail Access Expansion:** Walmart/OnePay''s planned integration could expose
  crypto access to one of the largest US retail user bases, signaling major potential
  for increased mainstream adoption.

  *   **Coinbase Growth Pressure:** The Samsung partnership is crucial for Coinbase,
  which is facing slowing growth (Q2 revenue up only 3%) compared to competitors like
  Kraken and Robinhood.

  *   **Stablecoin Milestone:** The overall stablecoin market capitalization has surpassed
  the $300 billion mark, indicating robust activity and trust in dollar-backed digital
  assets despite broader market volatility (e.g., US government shutdown).


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Samsung & Coinbase:** Expanding their partnership to allow Samsung Pay to
  fund Coinbase accounts, including promotional offers via Samsung Wallet.

  *   **Walmart & OnePay (Powered by ZeroHash):** Planning to roll out Bitcoin and
  Ether trading/custody within the OnePay mobile banking app, allowing crypto-to-cash
  conversion for use at Walmart.

  *   **Shibarium Developers:** Actively managing the aftermath of a $4 million exploit,
  including token recovery and security hardening.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  The report notes a "more favorable US crypto policy backdrop," specifically mentioning
  the **Clarity for Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act** and the ongoing
  push to permit **crypto inclusion in 401k plans**. This regulatory clarity is cited
  as a factor supporting major corporate moves like Walmart/OnePay''s entry.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  The industry is moving toward deeper integration where crypto services are embedded
  directly into existing, ubiquitous consumer platforms (smartphones, retail banking
  apps). The focus is shifting from pure trading to utility, such as using crypto
  balances to pay for groceries or reduce card debt (as planned by OnePay). International
  expansion of these corporate partnerships is also anticipated.


  **7. Target Audience**:

  **Crypto Professionals, Fintech Investors, and Corporate Strategy Analysts** interested
  in enterprise adoption, retail onboarding metrics, and the intersection of Big Tech/Retail
  with digital assets.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast episode centers on tangible evidence of accelerating mainstream cryptocurrency
  adoption in the US, driven by strategic partnerships between tech giants and established
  financial/retail entities. The headline development is the **expansion of the Samsung
  and Coinbase partnership**, enabling US Galaxy users to directly fund their Coinbase
  accounts using Samsung Pay. This move provides Coinbase with a vital new retail
  funding rail amid slowing growth figures, bolstered by promotional incentives like
  fee waivers via the Samsung Wallet.


  Simultaneously, the report highlights a major development from the retail sector:
  **Walmart-backed OnePay** is preparing to launch Bitcoin and Ether trading and custody
  services on its mobile banking app later this year, utilizing infrastructure provided
  by **ZeroHash**. This integration is significant because it promises to bring crypto
  access to one of the largest US retail user bases, allowing users to convert crypto
  directly into cash for shopping at Walmart or paying down balances. This corporate
  activity is contextualized against a backdrop of improving US regulatory sentiment,
  specifically referencing the **Clarity for Digital Commodities Consumer Protection
  Act** and discussions around 401k crypto inclusion.


  In contrast to these adoption stories, the episode addresses a significant security
  challenge within the decentralized ecosystem: the **Shibarium exploit**. Developers
  are actively working to restore the Ethereum bridge and have successfully secured
  recovered funds (over $4.6 million in BONE tokens) after a hacker exploited the
  system, resulting in approximately $4.1 million in stolen assets. The team’s swift
  action in rotating validator keys and securing contracts serves as a case study
  in post-incident remediation.


  Overall, the narrative arc moves from corporate integration (Samsung/Coinbase, Walmart/OnePay)
  signaling utility and mainstream access, to market health indicators (stablecoin
  market cap hitting $300B), and finally, to necessary security responses within the
  DeFi/L2 space. The underlying theme is that crypto is successfully embedding itself
  into everyday consumer spending and banking infrastructure, supported by evolving
  policy frameworks.'
