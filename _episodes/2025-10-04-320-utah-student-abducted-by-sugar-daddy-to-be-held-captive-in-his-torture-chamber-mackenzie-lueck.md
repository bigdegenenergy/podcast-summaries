summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - Mackenzie Lueck, a driven pre-nursing student, went missing on June 17, 2019,
    after meeting an online contact at Hatch Park in Salt Lake City.
  - Mackenzie was exploring 'sugar dating' on the platform Seeking Arrangements, a
    fact she kept hidden from her close-knit family.
  - The man she met, Ayula Anjayi, had a hidden, disturbing background including a
    history of alleged abuse, being kicked out of the National Guard, and planning
    to build a secret, soundproof room with unusual features.
  - The meeting location—a dark park with non-functional security cameras—suggests
    the rendezvous was deliberately chosen to avoid digital trails.
  - Mackenzie's family quickly recognized her sudden radio silence and lack of bank
    activity as major red flags, prompting a serious investigation.
  - Ayula Anjayi had crafted a polished online persona that masked his volatile temper
    and disturbing history, including a prior unprosecuted sexual assault allegation.
  overview: This episode details the disturbing disappearance and murder of Mackenzie
    Lueck, a University of Utah student who vanished after landing at the airport
    following a family funeral in California. She was last seen taking a late-night
    ride-share to a dark park to meet a man she connected with online, Ayula Anjayi,
    who harbored dark secrets and fantasies of building a torture chamber.
