  text: And so starting to try to understand why these edge devices were having unusual
    behavior when they worked together led me to start looking at network and network
    science. And then how you deal with a lot of network science concepts is using
    a graph. Because until you can represent your network as a graph, you then can't
    use. That's when you get to use computer science capabilities because you have
    to model it in a way that computers can deal with it.
  topic: strategy/technical
- impact_reason: 'Explains the core advantage of graphs in fraud/crime detection:
    they excel at connecting disparate, non-obvious ''breadcrumbs'' of activity that
    look normal in isolation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The reason why graphs are so good about finding aberrant or bad behavior is
    that if you think about how somebody trying to hide their tracks, they don't,
    if you're, if you have activity going on, usually there are multiple touch points
    in criminal behavior. So it's not like somebody walks through the door and advertises
    that they are doing something criminally bad.
  topic: business/technical
- impact_reason: Directly contrasts the relational power of graphs against traditional
    tabular data structures (SQL/spreadsheets) for complex, multi-entity investigations.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And the other thing is really bad behavior is rarely a one-person or one-entity
    point-in-time thing. It usually has multiple different collaborators. And so again,
    you need to be able to see the relationships between those collaborators and their
    behavior and their addresses and and. And so you can imagine that gets into lots
    of dots and links between them. And that's hard to look at as rows and tables.
    If you look at that as some rows and tables, you're just not going to see a pattern.
  topic: business/technical
- impact_reason: A major strategic warning against relying solely on historical ML
    predictions without understanding the underlying network structure, especially
    relevant for supply chain resilience and robustness against 'Black Swan' events.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And part of that was because most of the way we were looking at supply chains
    was looking at the past. And this is a classic machine learning mistake is that
    you do correlations that you make predictions based on what you've seen in the
    past. But if you don't understand your network, your customers, your supply chains,
    your partners very well, and you're just predicting based on what you've seen
    in the past, when there is an event that shifts the underlying reality, you are
    going to fall down.
  topic: strategy/business
- impact_reason: Directly connects the graph topic to the current dominant AI trend
    (LLMs), signaling the relevance of graphs in modern generative AI architectures.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think we should also talk about graph RAG, because that's one of the things
    that's really hot right now, especially with LLMs.
  topic: AI/ML
- impact_reason: 'Explains the fundamental benefit of Graph RAG: providing structured,
    relational context to LLMs, which enhances accuracy and reduces hallucinations
    by grounding responses in explicit relationships.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So, when you're using a graph, you're essentially giving the LLM a knowledge
    base that is structured, and it's not just a flat document store. So, you're giving
    it the relationships, which is what LLMs are really good at understanding, but
    you're giving it the context of those relationships.
  topic: AI/ML
- impact_reason: Pinpoints the specific limitation of current LLMs (complex, multi-hop
    reasoning) and positions graphs as the essential augmentation tool to overcome
    this weakness.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So, one of the things we're seeing is that LLMs are really good at language,
    but they're not necessarily good at reasoning over complex, multi-hop relationships.
    And that's where the graph comes in to augment the LLM's capabilities.
  topic: AI/ML
- impact_reason: 'Highlights the core value proposition of graph analysis: structure
    (topology) reveals underlying dynamics that simple statistics miss.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The topology of a network is really indicative of the behavior within a network,
    like whether your network is growing, whether it's breaking apart, whether it's
    dying, whether it's it's clumping together. Those are often driven by internal
    dynamics of your network science.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: This is a strong differentiator statement, positioning graph algorithms
    as complementary to, and sometimes superior to, traditional ML/statistical methods
    when structural insights are required.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And you can't very easily see those with statistical methods or with machine
    learning methods, but graph algorithms compute over topology, they compute over
    structure. And so the results of them will actually tell you something that you
    didn't know about your network, and you can infer meaning from that.
  topic: technical/strategy
- impact_reason: A profound critique of the current GenAI focus, suggesting that sequence
    prediction (LLMs) often comes at the expense of deep structural understanding
    (graphs) of the underlying systems.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And to me is so important right now because a lot of times I feel like in
    this moment, this machine learning, Gen AI moment, we are predicting the next
    item in a sequence, but we're not understanding our network, our customers, our
    patients, our supply chain as well.
  topic: safety/predictions
- impact_reason: 'Crucial insight into the current AI landscape: Gen AI/LLMs are not
    replacing older techniques (like graphs) but are making previously intractable
    problems solvable by combining them.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There's also some emerging use cases that I don't know if I would say re-emerging
    that people had talked about previously that are now becoming more tractable because
    they're combining it with LLMs and Gen AI.
  topic: AI technology trends/integration
- impact_reason: 'Clearly defines the synergy: LLMs handle the unstructured language
    understanding, while graphs handle the structural, relational context.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's easier now because you can use the LLMs, the parts, the language, and
    then use the graph to understand the connections between the different documents.
  topic: AI technology trends/integration
- impact_reason: Addresses the hype cycle of RAG, suggesting performance limitations
    are driving the need for augmentation (like graphs), and clarifies that Graph
    RAG is additive, not replacement.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: there are several reasons why rag has plateaued. It doesn't replace it, augments,
    augments rag, anyhow.
  topic: AI technology trends/limitations
- impact_reason: 'Explains *why* pure vector search fails: it misses topological (structural)
    significance, which graphs inherently capture.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The retrieval effectiveness, pure semantic vector search can be insufficient.
    So, you might get an approximate match rather than an exact match, or you might
    get it, you might want a match that has topological significance that you're just
    not getting.
  topic: technical/model limitations
- impact_reason: 'Describes the optimal architecture for hybrid RAG: parallel execution
    of vector (fuzzy) and graph (specific/topological) searches to maximize retrieval
    quality.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Am I correct in understanding that they happen in parallel? That you would
    be doing a vector search as well as a graph search in parallel? And so, then you
    get the best of both worlds. You get the fuzziness of the vector search with the
    specificity of a graph search.
  topic: technical/architecture
- impact_reason: 'Crucial strategic advice for modern AI/data engineering: the necessity
    of dedicated graph databases has diminished; computational graph projections are
    now viable, offering flexibility.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I would say right now, don't lock yourself into one methodology. In the past
    several years ago, maybe three, four years ago, it was assumed if you were going
    to add graph to your capabilities, you had to have a graph database. That is no
    longer the case.
  topic: strategy/technical shift
- impact_reason: A strong statement on the current limitations of generative AI and
    ML, clearly defining the boundary where other techniques (like optimization) must
    take over.

    that document, and you put that into a graph, and then you ask the LLM a question,
    the LLM can traverse that graph to find the answer, which is much more reliable
    than just having the LLM read the document itself.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: 923: Graph Algorithms, GraphRAG and Causal Graphs,
  with Graph Guru Amy Hodler


  This episode of the Super Data Science Podcast, hosted by John Cron, features graph
  analytics expert Amy Hodler, author of the O''Reilly book *Graph Algorithms*. The
  discussion provides a comprehensive overview of graph data structures, fundamental
  algorithms, and cutting-edge applications, particularly in the context of modern
  AI and data analysis challenges.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Graph Data Structures and Algorithms**, transitioning
  into advanced applications such as **GraphRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for
  LLMs**, **Causal Graphs**, and the practical use of graphs in domains like **fraud
  detection, supply chain optimization, and network science.**


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Graph Modeling Flexibility:** Graphs capture relationships via **nodes (vertices)**
  and **edges (links)**. The discussion highlighted two main modeling paradigms: **Property
  Graphs** (offering flexibility with properties on nodes/edges) and **RDF/Triples**
  (more verbose, often used in knowledge graphs, emphasizing subject-predicate-object
  structure with stronger rule enforcement).

  *   **Computational Considerations in Traversal:** While powerful, graph operations
  like **All-Pair Shortest Path** can be computationally intensive if approached naively.
  Thoughtfulness in query design (e.g., optimizing for Top K paths instead of *all*
  pairs) and tailoring the data model are crucial for managing complexity, which often
  mirrors the complexity of multiple joins in relational databases.

  *   **Algorithm Power over Topology:** Graph algorithms (like PageRank or Community
  Detection) are vital because they compute directly over the **network topology (structure)**,
  revealing insights about network dynamics (growth, clumping, importance) that standard
  statistical or sequence-based ML methods often miss.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Fraud and Anomaly Detection:** Graphs excel at uncovering complex, multi-touchpoint
  criminal behavior (money laundering, fraud rings) by following temporal "breadcrumbs"
  that appear as non-obvious patterns in tabular data.

  *   **Supply Chain Resilience:** Understanding the underlying network structure,
  rather than just historical correlations, is essential for robust supply chain management.
  Graphs enable dynamic route optimization when disruptions occur (e.g., a closed
  port).

  *   **The Shift Beyond Prediction:** In the current GenAI moment, there is a critical
  need to move beyond predicting the next sequence item toward **understanding the
  underlying network structure** of customers, patients, or systems, where graph analytics
  provide the necessary structural inference.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Amy Hodler:** Graph Guru, author of *Graph Algorithms* (O''Reilly), and founder/executive
  director of **Graph Geeks**.

  *   **Michelle Yee (Episode 915 Guest):** Mentioned as an outstanding communicator,
  highlighting the importance of clear explanation in complex technical fields.

  *   **Larry Page:** Creator of the **PageRank** algorithm, originally used for inferring
  source credibility (now applied widely, including in neuroscience for telomere lifespan
  analysis).

  *   **Dell Technologies & Intel:** Sponsors, highlighting the importance of hardware
  acceleration (AI PCs with Intel Core Ultra) for demanding local model inference
  and data science workloads.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests that as data complexity increases, the integration
  of graph structures will become fundamental, especially in AI. The emergence of
  **GraphRAG** indicates that graphs will serve as structured, relational memory stores
  for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to access and reason over complex,
  interconnected knowledge beyond simple text retrieval. Causal graphs also point
  toward a future where systems can better model *why* things happen, not just *what*
  happens next.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers,
  Data Architects, and Technology Leaders** involved in building complex analytical
  systems, especially those dealing with interconnected data, risk modeling, recommendation
  engines, or knowledge representation for AI applications.'
