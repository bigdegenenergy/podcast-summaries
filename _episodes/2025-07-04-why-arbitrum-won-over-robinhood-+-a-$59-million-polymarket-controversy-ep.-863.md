    that love it, have years of experience and code already written in Rust or C or
    C++ or other languages.
  topic: Adoption/Business

    entities like Robinhood to capture Miner Extractable Value (MEV) that would otherwise

  text: If Robinhood is launching and could only be on someone else's public blockchain,
    they're going to leak all that MEV to someone else. So, certainly, having your

    uniquely possible on your own chain.

    like something built by Flashbots, like that is going to be their decision, and
    I don't have anything to say they're today. But the idea that they can capture
    their own MEV is something that's really uniquely possible on your own chain.

    finger to everybody who voted yes on last month's market, right? It's saying,
    'Hey, this is a very similar outfit, and even though some people called it a suit
    last month, we ultimately resolved to no.' So, if they were to resolve to yes
    this time around, it would just be a massive contradiction...

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why Arbitrum Won Over Robinhood + A $59 Million
  Polymarket Controversy - Ep. 863


  This episode of Unchained features a double-header, with the primary focus being
  an in-depth interview with **Stephen Goldfetter, Co-founder and CEO of Offchain
  Labs (creators of Arbitrum)**, discussing the massive strategic partnership with
  Robinhood. The latter segment briefly touches upon a $59 million controversy on
  Polymarket.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Blockchain Infrastructure, Layer 2 Scaling Solutions (specifically
  Arbitrum), and the convergence of TradFi with Web3**, exemplified by Robinhood''s
  decision to build its financial services on the Arbitrum tech stack. Secondary topics
  include advanced L2 customization and the challenge of liquidity fragmentation.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Arbitrum Stylus Advantage:** Stylus allows developers on Arbitrum (an EVM
  chain) to write smart contracts using traditional, high-performance languages like
  **Rust and C/C++**. This offers up to a **10x cost reduction** for computational
  tasks (like ZK proof verification) and seamlessly interoperates with existing Solidity
  code via the Solidity ABI, bridging the gap for Web2 developers.

  *   **Arbitrum Orbit Customization:** The Arbitrum tech stack (Orbit) allows entities
  like Robinhood to launch their own chains with "out-of-the-box" customizations (e.g.,
  custom gas tokens like stablecoins, choice of data availability layers like Celestia/EigenDA)
  or deeper, bespoke changes (e.g., integrating institutional KYC or privacy features).

  *   **MEV Capture and Fee Revenue:** Launching a dedicated chain via Orbit allows
  entities to **capture Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)** and convert transaction
  fees from an operating cost (when using a public chain) into a direct **revenue
  stream**.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **The "Rails of the Future":** The conversation frames crypto infrastructure
  as the inevitable "rails" for future financial systems, citing the move from pen-and-paper
  to mainframes as a historical parallel. The Robinhood deal validates this long-term
  vision.

  *   **Tokenized Equities as the "Main Prize":** Offchain Labs viewed Robinhood’s
  commitment to launching tokenized stocks and ETFs on the Arbitrum ecosystem as the
  most significant win, as it represents the true reinvention of core financial products
  on-chain, bridging TradFi directly into DeFi.

  *   **DAO Revenue Share:** The Arbitrum DAO benefits monetarily from every chain
  launched using the Arbitrum stack, as these partnerships often include a **10% profit
  share**, aligning incentives between the core team and the decentralized governance
  body.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Robinhood:** The major client, choosing Arbitrum over potential competitors
  (like Solana) for its tokenized stock and proprietary chain development.

  *   **Stephen Goldfetter (Offchain Labs CEO):** Provided detailed insights into
  the technical and strategic reasons behind Robinhood''s choice.

  *   **AJ Warner (Arbitrum CSO):** Highlighted that the tokenized stock offering,
  not just the chain itself, was the primary strategic goal.

  *   **Flav (mentioned):** Quoted from a CNBC appearance reinforcing the belief that
  crypto is the next evolution of financial rails.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched on the logistical challenges of integrating traditional markets
  (which operate on limited hours) with 24/7 crypto markets, specifically regarding
  price divergence between tokenized assets and underlying assets. However, the consensus
  was that increased efficiency, faster settlement (moving beyond T+5 for funds),
  and arbitrage opportunities driven by deep liquidity will ultimately resolve these
  short-term friction points.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward **native on-chain operations** for core financial
  services. The future involves a hybrid environment where Web2 developers can easily
  contribute using familiar languages (via Stylus) and where large institutions can
  customize their own compliant environments (via Orbit) while remaining interoperable
  with the broader L2 ecosystem. The key bottleneck identified for mass adoption is
  **UX/wallet support**, which needs to abstract away blockchain complexity, similar
  to how web browsers abstracted away raw internet addresses.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Infrastructure Professionals, DeFi
  Strategists, Venture Capitalists, and Web2 Executives** considering blockchain integration,
  as it details the competitive advantages of specific L2 technology stacks and provides
  a case study on securing a major TradFi partnership.'
