summary: '## Summary of Finding Genius Podcast Episode with Pablo S. Holman


  This episode of *The Finding Genius Podcast*, hosted by Richard Jacobs, features
  venture capitalist Pablo S. Holman, Managing Director of Deep Future. The discussion
  centers on Holmanâ€™s focus on **deep tech investing**â€”funding breakthrough technologies
  often ignored by mainstream Silicon Valleyâ€”and highlights several specific, high-impact
  investments his firm is pursuing.

  ### 1. Main Narrative Arc and Key Discussion Points


  The conversation begins with Jacobs establishing the podcast''s mission: interviewing
  "geniuses" to distill complex knowledge. Holman introduces his role at Deep Future,
  emphasizing their focus on **deep tech**â€”technologies that require fundamental scientific
  breakthroughs to improve industries like energy, food, mining, and manufacturing
  by factors of 10x or 100x, rather than incremental software improvements. The core
  of the episode is Holman detailing two specific, revolutionary investments: autonomous,
  wind-powered cargo ships and next-generation, highly efficient electric motors based
  on novel magnetic configurations.


  ### 2. Major Topics, Themes, and Subject Areas Covered


  *   **Deep Tech Venture Capital:** Investing in foundational science and engineering
  before traditional financial metrics (like spreadsheets or revenue) are available.

  *   **Maritime Technology:** Decarbonizing and automating global shipping.

  *   **Advanced Materials Science:** The creation of ultra-long carbon nanotubes
  for high-performance applications.

  *   **Electromagnetism and Motor Efficiency:** Breakthroughs in magnetic configurations
  leading to vastly more efficient electric motors.

  *   **Investment Stages:** Delineation between pre-seed (Holmanâ€™s focus), seed-stage,
  and Series A funding rounds.


  ### 3. Technical Concepts, Methodologies, or Frameworks Discussed


  *   **Autonomous Sailing Cargo Ships:** Utilizing rigid, computer-controlled sails
  (like drones) for propulsion, achieving **100% fuel savings** (relying on wind,
  supplemented by solar and regenerative drag charging batteries). The hull design
  is crucial, requiring a **V-shaped hull** for stability against sideways wind forces,
  unlike the flat hulls of conventional cargo ships.

  *   **Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs):** The ability to produce **super long, ultra-long
  CNTs** from methane cracking. This overcomes the historical limitation of CNTs being
  produced only as "dust." The strength of these long fibers, held together by **van
  der Waals forces**, makes them candidates for materials like carbon fiber 2.0, potentially
  enabling concepts like a **space elevator**.

  *   **Virtual Tri-Polar Magnetism:** A novel magnetic arrangement (North-South-North
  or similar configuration) that allows for stable magnetic levitation and enables
  the creation of highly efficient electric motors.


  ### 4. Business Implications and Strategic Insights


  *   **Disrupting Legacy Industries:** Deep tech aims to overhaul massive, slow-moving
  sectors (like shipping) where software alone cannot drive necessary improvements.

  *   **Efficiency Gains in Shipping:** The autonomous sailing ships offer massive
  cost savings (eliminating fuel costs, which account for five out of six dollars
  spent) and align with new maritime emission standards. The bottleneck in shipping
  is port waiting time, not sea travel time.

  *   **Material Revolution:** Long CNTs promise to replace traditional high-performance
  materials in aerospace, automotive, and construction (e.g., replacing rebar).

  *   **Electric Motor Efficiency:** The new magnetic configuration achieves **97%
  efficiency**, significantly outperforming current motors (often in the 60% range),
  leading to increased range for drones and electric vehicles, and reduced waste heat.


  ### 5. Key Personalities, Experts, or Thought Leaders Mentioned


  *   **Pablo S. Holman:** Venture capitalist, inventor, and technology futurist,
  Managing Director of Deep Future.

  *   **Richard Jacobs:** Host of *The Finding Genius Podcast*.

  *   **Peter Diamandis:** Mentioned as an inspiration for starting the podcast due
  to his future-focused newsletters.

  *   **Jeff Bezos:** Mentioned in Holmanâ€™s background regarding playing with spaceships
  at Blue Origin.


  ### 6. Predictions, Trends, or Future-Looking Statements


  *   Everything requiring high-performance materials (skis, race cars, rockets) will
  eventually be made from ultra-long CNTs.

  *   The new highly efficient electric motors will eventually be used in "everything
  that flies at least and that is electric," as well as cars, motorcycles, and power
  plants.

  *   The autonomous cargo ships may initially carry only a few thousand containers,
  serving smaller ports currently underserved by massive container vessels.


  ### 7. Practical Applications and Real-World Examples


  *   **Cargo Ships:** Eliminating fuel costs and reducing emissions while only slightly
  increasing transit time (which is often irrelevant due to port congestion).

  *   **CNTs:** Creating tape, ropes, wires, and honeycomb panels; the theoretical
  application of a **space elevator** tether.

  *   **Motors:** Creating highly efficient **ring motors** (axle-less design) ideal
  for electric drones and aircraft, offering more thrust or range without added weight.
  They can also improve microphone fidelity by eliminating physical connections.


  ### 8. Controversies, Challenges, or Problems Highlighted


  *   **Retrofitting Ships:** Existing cargo ships cannot be easily retrofitted for
  sailing because their flat hulls are not designed to handle the lateral forces generated
  by sails, leading to excessive rolling.

  *   **Investment Risk:** Deep tech investing is challenging because it precedes
  traditional metrics; investors must deeply understand the underlying science to
  assess commercialization potential.

  *   **Piracy/Security:** The lack of crew on autonomous ships removes the leverage
  pirates typically seek, though remote control and insurance considerations remain.
