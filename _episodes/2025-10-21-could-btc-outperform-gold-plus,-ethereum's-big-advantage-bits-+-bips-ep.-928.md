summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Could BTC Outperform Gold? Plus, Ethereum''s
  Big Advantage (Bits + Bips - Ep. 928)


  This episode marks the launch of Season 2 of *Bits + Bips*, introducing a new permanent
  co-host lineup featuring **Ram Alamalia**, **Chris Perkins** (President of Coin
  Fund), and new moderator **Austin Campbell** (NYU Stern/Zero Knowledge Consulting).
  The discussion centers on the collision of crypto and macroeconomics, focusing initially
  on the power dynamics of centralized exchanges (CEXs) and the systemic failures
  observed during a recent major crypto liquidation event.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus areas were:

  1. **Centralized Exchange (CEX) Power & Listings:** Analyzing the controversy surrounding
  Binance''s alleged high listing fees and the broader implications for market access
  and competition.

  2. **Derivatives Market Infrastructure & Risk Management:** A deep dive into the
  recent "Black Friday" $20 billion liquidation event, examining the failures of Automatic
  Deleveraging (ADL) and comparing crypto derivatives infrastructure against traditional
  finance (TradFi) risk waterfalls.

  3. **Bitcoin vs. Gold & Ethereum''s Longevity:** A brief discussion on Bitcoin''s
  valuation relative to gold and Ethereum''s unique advantages stemming from its long
  operational history.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **TradFi Risk Waterfall:** Chris Perkins detailed the five-tiered risk management
  framework used in traditional derivatives clearinghouses (CCPs): 1) Good Pricing,
  2) Initial Margin, 3) Exchange/Clearinghouse Skin in the Game, 4) Guarantee/Insurance
  Funds, and 5) Recovery/Resolution (where ADL sits as a last resort).

  *   **ADL as a Design Flaw:** The recent mass liquidations highlighted that relying
  solely on Automatic Deleveraging (ADL) without upstream buffers (like FCMs or robust
  margining) is a systemic design flaw, forcing innocent participants to absorb losses.

  *   **Internet Capital Markets Thesis:** The discussion supported the trend toward
  direct listings (like those seen with canonical equities on Solana) as the future
  of capital formation, potentially bypassing expensive intermediated IPOs, mirroring
  the efficiency seen in the unregulated meme coin market.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Binance Fee Structure:** The alleged listing fees (8% of token supply plus
  a $2M deposit) highlight the immense cost of distribution and liquidity acquisition,
  which is a necessary expense whether paid directly to a CEX or indirectly through
  TradFi intermediaries.

  *   **Competition is the Solution:** The consensus was that the market power of
  dominant CEXs like Binance will only be curtailed through robust competition, particularly
  from regulated onshore US entities that can offer alternative, transparent distribution
  channels.

  *   **Bullish on Derivatives Learning:** While the liquidation event was catastrophic,
  the hosts view it as a necessary stress test that will force the industry to adopt
  better risk management principles, ultimately making derivatives markets (which
  are highly lucrative) more resilient and attractive for institutional capital.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Binance/CZ:** Central to the listing fee controversy; CZ’s response and the
  allegations against the exchange’s vertical integration (acting as broker, exchange,
  custodian, and stablecoin issuer) were discussed.

  *   **Coinbase/Jesse Pollock/Dr. Bune:** Positioned themselves as the competitive
  alternative, actively advertising their platform (Base) as a fee-free alternative
  to paying Binance for listings.

  *   **Don Wilson (DRW Founder):** His analysis provided the framework for understanding
  why the CEX infrastructure failed the stress test, emphasizing the need for TradFi
  buffers.

  *   **Robert Leshinor (Super State):** Mentioned for pioneering on-chain canonical
  equities via direct listing on Solana, supporting the internet capital markets thesis.

  *   **Mantle:** Featured as a sponsor pioneering "blockchain for banking," focusing
  on payments, trading, and assets on the Mantle Network.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Segregation of Duties:** The discussion highlighted that Binance’s vertical
  integration—combining exchange, custody, and capital-raising functions—is generally
  prohibited in the US due to regulations enforcing segregation of duties, which are
  designed to protect the system.

  *   **Offshoring Pressure:** It was noted that US regulatory pressure (specifically
  under the current administration) pushed much of this activity offshore, forcing
  entities like Binance to build vertically integrated structures out of necessity.

  *   **Need for Onshore Competition:** The path forward requires US-based competitors
  to enter the market to provide regulated alternatives, thereby fixing the distribution
  problem through competition rather than solely relying on regulatory enforcement
  against offshore entities.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is expected to move toward **greater institutional adoption of derivatives**,
  but only after implementing robust, transparent risk management frameworks borrowed
  from TradFi (the risk waterfall). Furthermore, the convergence of tokenized equities
  and traditional listings via direct listing mechanisms is seen as the future of
  capital formation, potentially unlocking massive market caps currently seen only
  in unregulated crypto sectors.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Investors, TradFi Professionals transitioning
  to Digital Assets, Risk Managers, and Blockchain Infrastructure Developers** who
  need nuanced insights into market structure, regulatory arbitrage, and the technical
  resilience of decentralized finance systems.'
