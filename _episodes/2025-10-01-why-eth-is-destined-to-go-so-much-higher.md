summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why ETH Is Destined To Go So Much Higher


  This 80-minute episode of The Edge Podcast, featuring host DeFi Dad, Nomadic, and
  returning guest Ryan Berkman (an ETH investor), focuses on the fundamental strength
  of the Ethereum network and the compelling long-term investment case for Ether (ETH),
  arguing that its price significantly lags behind its underlying utility and ambition.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Crypto/Web3**, specifically analyzing the fundamental growth,
  technical upgrades, and macro-narrative shifts driving the value proposition of
  **Ethereum (ETH)** and its ecosystem, particularly in relation to **Decentralized
  Finance (DeFi)** and institutional adoption.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Dencun Upgrade Catalyst:** The upcoming Dencun upgrade (slated around December
  3rd at the time of recording) is highlighted as a key technical catalyst, expected
  to significantly benefit Layer 2 (L2) activity, which in turn supports the L1 and
  ETH as a store of value.

  *   **L1 Scaling via L2s:** The strategy of scaling Ethereum through L2s (rollups)
  is validated, with the Ethereum Foundation''s current strategy explicitly focusing
  on scaling L1 (via institutional adoption/blockspace) and scaling L2s (via blobs/data
  availability).

  *   **Low-Risk DeFi as the Gateway:** Vitalik Buterin''s concept of "Low-Risk DeFi"
  is discussed as the crucial entry point for global commerce. This concept emphasizes
  minimizing friction through decentralization, permissionless access, and automated
  execution, paving the way for broader adoption beyond simple lending.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Strong Long-Term Conviction:** The guest asserts a high conviction that ETH
  is "destined to go so much higher," suggesting a reliable 5x return (not inflation-adjusted)
  over a 5-to-10-year horizon, positioning ETH as "buying the future of capitalism."

  *   **Sentiment Shift:** The market sentiment around ETH has transformed from its
  "worst place" in Spring (when ETH was ~$1,500) to one of the most bullish periods
  since 2018, driven by mainstream recognition.

  *   **Institutional Validation:** The entry of major figures and DAOs associated
  with traditional finance (TradFi) buying and advocating for ETH provides a new,
  politically diverse coalition supporting the network''s long-term roadmap.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Ryan Berkman:** ETH investor whose previous analysis from April proved prescient
  regarding the subsequent price rally.

  *   **Ethereum Foundation (EF):** Praised for its significantly improved execution,
  strategic coherence, and pragmatic evolution, including new institutional teams
  and a clear three-part scaling strategy.

  *   **Digital Asset Treasury Companies (DAOs):** Mentioned as crucial new stakeholders
  providing political backing and capital flows (e.g., SBET).

  *   **Key Advocates:** Joe Lubin, Joseph Schalam (ex-BlackRock), and Tom Lee are
  cited for pushing the ETH narrative into mainstream finance.

  *   **The Defiant:** Highlighted as a keystone organization operating at the intersection
  of Wall Street, government, and product development, effectively packaging Ethereum''s
  value proposition.

  *   **Vitalik Buterin:** His recent focus on "Low-Risk DeFi" and undercollateralized
  lending signals a growing acknowledgment and enthusiasm for DeFi applications built
  on the platform.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Stablecoin Embrace:** The growing acceptance of stablecoins by the new administration
  is viewed as a massive catalyst, as stablecoins (over 99% USD-denominated on-chain)
  represent global faith in the US dollar, which Ethereum facilitates permissionlessly.

  *   **Alignment with American Values:** Ethereum is framed as embodying core American
  principles: property rights, permissionless innovation, and freedom.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests Ethereum is evolving into **civilizational infrastructure**.
  The future involves DeFi expanding from simple lending into complex areas like undercollateralized
  lending and identity (using ZK proofs), effectively acting as the "gateway drug"
  for Ethereum to capture global economic activity by drastically reducing friction.
  The increasing importance of external stakeholders (DAOs, Robinhood, Coinbase) means
  the EF will become proportionally less central over time—a positive, subtractive
  philosophy.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto/Web3 Professionals, Portfolio Managers, and Long-Term ETH Investors.**
  The discussion requires familiarity with L1/L2 scaling, DeFi primitives, and institutional
  crypto narratives.'
