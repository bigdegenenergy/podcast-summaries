    Dollar is eroding, validating the need for alternatives like Bitcoin and gold.

  text: Even in most financial crises in the past, what you saw was generally the

    That paradigm has fundamentally changed.

    the broader crypto ecosystem, suggesting capital naturally gravitates back to
    the base layer.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: All roads lead to Bitcoin, right, in my opinion. That's why people also have
    said within the crypto VC industry that all coins have been on the margin great
    because at some level, those who find success in all coins eventually allocate
    some portion back to Bitcoin regardless.
  topic: Investment Thesis/Strategy
- impact_reason: Provides stark macroeconomic context, contrasting the strong fiscal
    position of 1999 with today's high debt levels, which fundamentally supports the
    need for non-sovereign hedges like Bitcoin.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: In 1999, the US GDP was growing on the back of globalization as a trend, and
    the debt-to-GDP ratio was around 40%. It's a healthy market to grow into. Right
    now, it's 120%. We're over one.
  topic: Macro/Strategy
- impact_reason: This is a direct, high-impact pitch for a specific Bitcoin scaling/DeFi
    solution (KOR), emphasizing security, native Bitcoin usage ('no bridging'), and
    passive yield generation.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: You can earn yield on your Bitcoin by just holding your Bitcoin. It's simple.
    KOR is a protocol secured by elected validators. You can help elect validators
    and secure the network by simply locking up your Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain.
    No bridging, no lending, and just holding.
  topic: DeFi/Technology (Bitcoin Scaling)
- impact_reason: This describes a novel, non-custodial way for Bitcoin holders to
    earn yield directly on the Bitcoin blockchain without resorting to bridging or
    lending, which addresses major security concerns in the DeFi space.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: KOR is a protocol secured by elected validators. You can help elect validators
    and secure the network by simply locking up your Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain.
    No bridging, no lending, and just holding. When your validator secures KOR, it
    earns rewards fueled by network activity and passes them back to you as yield.
  topic: DeFi/Technology
- impact_reason: Proposes a superior macro metric (GDP-to-liquidity ratio) over the
    traditional debt-to-GDP ratio, linking liquidity directly to refinancing risk
    duration.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What you really need to focus on is the GDP-to-liquidity ratio because liquidity
    itself represents the duration of refinancing risk that is now being more meticulously
    challenged by the oversupply of global debt.
  topic: Strategy/Investment
- impact_reason: Confirms a massive institutional validation ($2B investment) of prediction
    markets, signaling a major shift in financial infrastructure.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Let's talk real quick about ICE and Polymarket. They announced a pretty big
    deal. ICE is going to invest $2 billion at a $9 billion post-money valuation in
    Polymarket. Prediction markets are here. This is real.
  topic: Web3/Adoption
- impact_reason: Identifies the convergence of finance and news/information as a key
    mega-trend, driven by decentralized prediction markets.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So the readiness of Polymarket being a part of our financial infrastructure
    is showing you a big mega-trend, which is financial information is becoming actually
    news information.
  topic: Web3/Adoption
- impact_reason: A powerful statement framing data ownership and monetization as the
    final battleground for individual economic empowerment against large tech entities.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And in that sense, the convergence of finance and information is happening,
    and at the center of that is the reality that data is kind of the last frontier
    of colonization.
  topic: Web3/Ownership
- impact_reason: This is a strong, provocative statement positioning Bitcoin as the
    ultimate store of value, even suggesting gold's potential valuation is contingent
    on Bitcoin's absence. It frames Bitcoin as superior to gold.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Gold may actually be $8 to $10,000 an ounce if Bitcoin didn't exist. All roads
    lead to Bitcoin, right, in my opinion.
  topic: Investment Thesis/Adoption
- impact_reason: This articulates a 'Bitcoin Maximalist' view within the broader crypto
    ecosystem, suggesting that success in altcoins ultimately validates and flows
    back into Bitcoin, treating even gold as a competing asset class (an 'altcoin').
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: All coins have been on the margin great because at some level, those who find
    success in all coins eventually allocate some portion back to Bitcoin regardless.
    World creation leads to Bitcoin as part of the denominator. And so in some sense,
    gold is also an altcoin in my opinion.
  topic: Investment Thesis/Adoption
- impact_reason: A sharp critique of the concept of the 'risk-free rate' (US Treasuries)
    in the current environment, suggesting it should be redefined as the 'risk-full
    rate.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I joked about a month ago and put out a little bit of satire, which was that
    we need to think about risk-free rate having a totally different definition now,
    and we now have to go around and tell everybody and call it the risk-full rate
    to start really normalizing that idea.
  topic: Investment Thesis/Strategy
- impact_reason: Directly states that the dollar's perceived safety is compromised,
    justifying the rotation into riskier, potentially higher-reward assets.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The risk-free rate of the dollar, frankly, is obviously kind of the thing
    that's at risk. And if you embrace that to now be considered the risk-full rate,
    well, there's a lot of other things that rather bet and take risk on than trading
    US bonds.
  topic: Investment Thesis
- impact_reason: Another endorsement from a legendary macro investor (Paul Tudor Jones)
    explicitly naming Bitcoin as a necessary hedge against inflation/debasement.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Paul Tudor Jones was very bullish on CNBC this week talking about things like
    Bitcoin and gold and saying what's a position there.
  topic: Adoption/Investment Thesis
- impact_reason: Shows mainstream financial infrastructure (Morgan Stanley) is officially
    integrating Bitcoin advice due to client demand, marking a major adoption milestone.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We saw Morgan Stanley now say that a 2% to 4% allocation is something that
    they want to support their 16,000 financial advisors in doing because they're
    getting a lot of inbound inquiries.
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: Critiques the traditional financial industry's framing of Bitcoin.
    It underscores the core long-term, permanent value proposition of Bitcoin versus
    short-term trading mentality.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: they allocated the recommendation was 4% for a bucket that was called 'opportunistic
    growth.' Opportunistic growth. I thought that was funny... anyone who's been around
    long enough knows this is actually the opposite of opportunistic; it's evergreen
    as it comes. It's the story value. It's permanent. You should have that always.
  topic: Investment Thesis/Strategy
- impact_reason: Offers a precise, alternative framing for Bitcoin's role in a portfolioâ€”'evergreen
    value'â€”which better reflects its fundamental scarcity and long-term store of value
    characteristics.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I just thought it was funny that Morgan Stanley made the move, but they called
    that 'opportunistic growth' when, in hindsight, I think it should be called like
    'evergreen value.'
  topic: Investment Thesis/Strategy
- impact_reason: A forward-looking statement emphasizing the growing necessity of
    non-fiat denominated assets due to changing macroeconomic landscapes.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: in 2025, the idea of having story value in your portfolio that isn't dollar-denominated
    is a key story.
  topic: Investment Thesis/Adoption
- impact_reason: Highlights the critical distinction between paper/tokenized gold
    exposure and true self-custody, drawing a parallel to the custody advantages of
    holding Bitcoin directly.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: one of the things people have called on for years, even the most tired gold
    bugs, is that GLD is not gold because it's an IOU that once you feel like you
    need it at the exact moment of its tail risk, it may not be actually available,
    and it could just evaporate.
  topic: Technology/Custody/Adoption
- impact_reason: Directly contrasts the custody friction of physical/paper gold with
    the relative ease of self-custody for Bitcoin, reinforcing Bitcoin's superior
    sovereignty feature.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: in that sense, challenges the idea of custody, the idea of self-custodial
    ownership, to which anyone who owns Bitcoin, I think, will find that aspect much
    easier to do.
  topic: Technology/Custody
- impact_reason: Further solidifies the idea of gold as a stepping stone asset for
    young investors moving towards Bitcoin, framing it as a competitor within the
    'alternative asset' bucket.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: in some sense, gold is also an altcoin in my opinion because those who make
    money on gold, especially the young people, will eventually look to diversify,
    and the correlation will not be perfect. And so if you made a ton of money on
    gold, you have a higher chance of winning allocation from that pocket of money
    to invest in Bitcoin than from Nvidia or from French government bonds or anything
    else.
  topic: Investment Thesis/Adoption
- impact_reason: Argues that current market overvaluation is heavily driven by sovereign/institutional
    activity (including direct government investment), signaling a fundamental shift
    away from traditional free-market dynamics.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: the stretch is not just coming from, I think, the private sector and individual
    investors; it's really coming from institutional flows. And there's no more prime
    example to share on that beyond the fact that the US government is proactively
    staking in public companies here in this country at this moment.
  topic: Macro/Regulation
- impact_reason: Identifies the unwinding of the globalization trend that defined
    the late 90s/early 2000s, suggesting a new, more fragmented and fiscally strained
    global economic structure where Bitcoin thrives.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is a pre-Euro, pre-China WTO, pre-Eastern Europe being part of the Eurozone
    world, to which now we've shown all of that has not worked, and it's totally being
    unwound to this particular moment...
  topic: Macro/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Highlights the core value proposition of this specific Bitcoin DeFi
    mechanism: earning yield while maintaining custody and minimizing lock-up risk.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: With a minimum lock-up of just one day, when the time lock ends, you get your
    Bitcoin back untouched. Still your keys, still your coins, now your yield.
  topic: DeFi/Custody
- impact_reason: A specific, high-impact prediction identifying Chinese M1 liquidity
    injection as the dominant macro driver for the near future (2025).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And on that point, the biggest driver of liquidity this year has been China,
    right? Their M1 liquidity actually has increased tremendously this year, and they
    are on a pretty well-documented plan, right? They're actually cutting down the
    oversupply of all their industrial output. They're actually trying to bring consumption
    back a little bit, investing the private sector the correct way. And so, you see
    Chinese equities react to it. So, M1 liquidity injection by China is very real,
    and that, I think, is the headline story of 2025.
  topic: Investment/Prediction
- impact_reason: Reframes debt analysis from a static balance sheet view to a dynamic
    flow/refinancing risk view, crucial for understanding systemic fragility.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So, it's not important to just think about GDP as a static measure; it's how
    much debt is there and actually how frequently do you have to refinance that because
    every refinancing is an event risk.
  topic: Strategy
- impact_reason: Challenges the conventional wisdom that credit investing is purely
    spread-based, arguing that absolute return targets dominate when baseline rates
    are high.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: My different view is that there's an absolute return level that credit investors
    at the corporate level seek to clear the hurdle to put allocations for. There's
    an absolute number. It's actually not a spread number.
  topic: Investment
- impact_reason: Explains how high sovereign yields compress credit spreads because
    the absolute return hurdle is already partially met by risk-free rates, leading
    to potentially misleading spread compression signals.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Well, when the US interest rate itself is giving you 4.5%, the US is already
    giving you a lot of that bogey. So, what that means is actually if you're not
    investing on a spread-based level but an absolute level, you have more room to
    compress on the credit side because the totality of it is actually still the same
    number.
  topic: Investment

    fundamental life skill, akin to financial literacy, essential for navigating ambiguity.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: The New Bitcoin Trade Everyone Is Doing | Jeff
  Park


  This 37-minute episode of the Pom Podcast, featuring Jeff Park (CIO at ProCAP BTC),
  centers on the growing institutional acknowledgment of global fiscal instabilityâ€”the
  "de-basement trade"â€”and how this dynamic is shifting capital toward assets like
  Bitcoin and gold, away from traditional dollar-denominated instruments.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Macroeconomics and Crypto/Digital Assets**, specifically
  analyzing the shift in global investor sentiment driven by persistent sovereign
  debt expansion ("fiscal dominance") and the resulting embrace of Bitcoin as a non-sovereign
  store of value. Secondary themes include the comparison between gold and Bitcoin,
  and the changing landscape of market euphoria versus underlying economic fundamentals.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Gold as an "Altcoin" to Bitcoin:** The argument is presented that if Bitcoin
  did not exist, the market capitalization of gold would be significantly higher (potentially
  $8,000â€“$10,000 per ounce), suggesting that successful capital generated in other
  assets (including gold) will eventually flow into Bitcoin as the ultimate denominator
  of scarce, non-sovereign wealth.

  *   **Self-Custody Advantage:** Bitcoin is highlighted as being fundamentally easier
  to self-custody and transfer than physical gold bullion, suggesting that as institutional
  adoption matures, Bitcoin''s utility in velocity and transfer will become a key
  differentiator over gold ETFs (like GLD).

  *   **Bitcoin DeFi Ecosystem:** Mention is made of the growing Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem
  (specifically referencing KOR), where users can earn yield by locking up Bitcoin
  to secure the network, representing an early stage of utility beyond simple holding.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **The De-Basement Trade is Mainstream:** Institutional recognition is accelerating,
  evidenced by major figures like Ken Griffin and Paul Tudor Jones discussing de-dollarization
  and Bitcoin, signaling that the narrative has moved beyond fringe belief.

  *   **Redefining Risk-Free Rate:** Investors are increasingly treating the US dollar/Treasury
  bond as the "risk-full rate," leading them to take more risk on alternative assets
  that offer better inflation protection.

  *   **Gold vs. Bitcoin Momentum:** While gold has recently outperformed Bitcoin
  on a year-to-date basis, Bitcoin maintains a massive long-term outperformance (10x
  over five years), suggesting both are durable hedges, but Bitcoin represents the
  more permanent, evergreen value proposition.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jeff Park (CIO, ProCAP BTC):** The guest, providing the core analysis on fiscal
  dominance and the de-basement trade.

  *   **Anthony Pompliano (Host):** Emphasizing the "all roads lead to Bitcoin" thesis
  and contrasting US fiscal stagnation with global industrial capacity (e.g., China''s
  infrastructure projects).

  *   **Paul Tudor Jones & Ken Griffin:** Cited as high-profile investors now publicly
  acknowledging the need for portfolio de-dollarization.

  *   **Morgan Stanley:** Mentioned for advising financial advisors to allocate 2-4%
  to Bitcoin, though humorously categorized by Park as "opportunistic growth" rather
  than "evergreen value."

  *   **Tether:** Noted for launching institutional products combining gold and Bitcoin
  performance, illustrating the merging of these two non-sovereign hedges.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion highlights the **irrelevance of traditional US fiscal drama** (like
  government shutdowns or minor credit rating threats) to global markets, as the overarching
  theme is global fiscal dominance and continued money printing across sovereign actors.
  The focus has shifted from political drama to industrial production and sovereign
  financial health.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests an industry trajectory where:

  1.  **Fiscal Reality Dominates:** The market narrative is permanently shifting away
  from US fiscal discipline as the primary anchor, moving toward assets that hedge
  against monetary expansion.

  2.  **AI and Productivity:** The de-basement trade is paralleled by massive capital
  flowing into AI, representing a search for *actual* productive utility in the new
  economic environment.

  3.  **Bitcoin Maturation:** Institutional adoption, driven by client demand, will
  continue to push Bitcoin into the core of modern portfolio theory, moving beyond
  "opportunistic" categorization.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Investment Professionals, Crypto Strategists,
  and Macro Hedge Fund Managers** who need concise analysis on how persistent monetary
  debasement is reshaping asset allocation strategies and validating the long-term
  thesis for Bitcoin.'
