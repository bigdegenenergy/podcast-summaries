summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: ⚠️Atención⚠️ Nunca antes vimos esta métrica
  en el mercado (14 Minutes)


  This episode of *Crypto Mercados y Pymes* focuses on analyzing a novel, internal
  on-chain market metric that provides short-term directional insights, juxtaposed
  against a backdrop of escalating global geopolitical and macroeconomic tensions.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Cryptocurrency Market Analysis**, specifically utilizing
  an **on-chain metric** to gauge internal market structure, distinct from traditional
  price action. Secondary themes include global macroeconomic instability (US-China
  trade war, recession fears) and the evolving role of digital assets (Bitcoin, Stablecoins)
  within this environment.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Novel On-Chain Metric:** The host introduces and analyzes a specific on-chain
  metric focused on the *internal structure* of the market, suggesting it offers short-term
  predictive value, especially when market sentiment is nervous.

  *   **Stablecoin Market Expansion:** The stablecoin market capitalization has surpassed
  **$300 billion**, with USDT leading and USDC being the second largest. The host
  suggests this massive stablecoin liquidity pool is poised to flow into either Bitcoin
  or other high-cap coins once the current "crypto-winter" sentiment subsides.

  *   **Meta-Planet Anomaly:** A Japanese company, Meta-Planet, now has a book value
  lower than the value of the Bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet—a situation the
  host claims has **never been seen before in the market.**


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Geopolitical Risk & Flight to Safety:** Renewed US-China trade tensions (potential
  100% tariffs by Trump) are driving investors toward traditional safe havens like
  Treasury bonds, the Euro, and the Swiss Franc, causing yields on major government
  bonds to drop.

  *   **Fed Policy Expectations:** Market sentiment suggests the Federal Reserve might
  stop reducing its balance sheet in the coming months, which the host notes would
  be "fantastic" for small-cap companies and liquidity.

  *   **ETF Flows Show Net Selling:** Despite BlackRock buying over $60 million in
  Bitcoin ETFs, the overall net flow for Bitcoin ETFs saw sales exceeding **$326 million**
  in the analyzed period. Ethereum ETFs experienced even heavier selling, with BlackRock
  selling over $310 million, leading to a total net negative flow above $428 million
  for ETH ETFs.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump & Xi Jinping:** Mentioned in the context of escalating trade
  war threats and the possibility of a meeting between the two leaders.

  *   **BlackRock:** Highlighted as a significant buyer of Bitcoin ETFs ($60M+) but
  also a major seller of Ethereum ETFs ($310M+).

  *   **Zero Hedge:** Cited for its observation that capital spending for the "new
  global environmental system" (AI) will eventually be financed by the US and Chinese
  governments, linking this to the value proposition of Bitcoin (energy-based vs.
  fiat).

  *   **Meta-Planet:** The Japanese company whose balance sheet anomaly (Bitcoin holdings
  > Book Value) is presented as a unique market event.

  *   **PAMP (CMIP):** A new, purely entertainment-focused "meme coin" on the Solana
  network, which the host intends to share details about daily in their bulletin.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **US DOJ Seizure:** The US Department of Justice executed the largest seizure
  in history in a fraud case, resulting in the acquisition of **127,271 Bitcoin**.
  This seizure means the US government now holds approximately 325,283 BTC, valued
  around $37 billion.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The analysis suggests a dichotomy: while traditional markets react nervously to
  trade wars, the underlying crypto infrastructure (stablecoins) is maturing rapidly.
  The comparison of current Bitcoin price action to late 2024 suggests a potential
  move toward the **$180,000 to $200,000 range** if historical patterns hold. The
  host emphasizes that the internal metric analysis will provide actionable short-term
  guidance for navigating the current slow market environment.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Active Crypto Traders and Professional Market
  Analysts** who require deep, technical on-chain data alongside macro context to
  inform short-term trading strategies.


  ---


  ### Comprehensive Summary Narrative


  The podcast episode begins by immediately addressing significant **global macroeconomic
  headwinds**, primarily the renewed trade tensions between the US and China following
  threats of massive tariffs by Donald Trump. This uncertainty has triggered a flight
  to safety, boosting demand for traditional assets like Treasury bonds, the Euro,
  and the Swiss Franc. Despite this, the host notes that recession probabilities in
  the US have drastically fallen according to some indicators (like Polymarket data
  cited by Zero Hedge).


  The discussion pivots to the evolving narrative around **Bitcoin and AI**. A key
  point raised is the theory that capital spending for the "new global environmental
  system" (AI infrastructure) will be government-financed, making energy-backed assets
  like Bitcoin fundamentally superior to falsifiable fiat currency.


  The core of the episode centers on **unprecedented market observations**. The host
  highlights the anomaly of the Japanese company Meta-Planet, whose Bitcoin holdings
  now exceed its entire book value. Furthermore, the massive growth of the stablecoin
  market ($300B+) is presented as a sign of latent capital waiting to deploy once
  market fear subsides.


  Analyzing recent ETF data, the episode reveals **significant net outflows** from
  both Bitcoin ($326M net sell) and Ethereum ($428M net sell), despite BlackRock making
  selective purchases. This selling pressure is occurring while Bitcoin ho'
