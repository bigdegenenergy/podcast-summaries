    still at ground zero because who's going to know about what I've built? How would
    I market this?

    moves away from the product/code itself and toward data, brand, or distribution.'

    as possible because they gave it for free... it doesn't give you advantage because
    it's giving the same advantage to everyone, which makes everyone get back to ground
    zero.

    technological change, the quality and conviction of the founding team is the primary
    differentiator.

  text: Technology will evolve. Ideas will change. Companies will pivot, but who are
    the people that are running the company? Are they 100% opportunistic, or are they

  topic: Investment
- impact_reason: Suggests that the current market is inflated because the underlying
    tech is too cheap/free, and that regulation/expensive compute might be necessary
    catalysts for true, sustainable value creation.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There are, I think, two main things that are missing. One is regulation, and
    the other is expensive tech. And what I mean by the second is the type of technology
    that is not free or $20 or $200 technology.

    and societal crises caused by generative AI (epistemic uncertainty).

    It is dead. It's a notion from 1710, dead overnight. There is no copyright. It's
    done. It's dead.

    immense, potentially world-altering power being concentrated in private hands,
    predicting inevitable government intervention.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced

    or heavily restrict foundational AI capabilities once they become too powerful
    or destabilizing.

    purposeful direction (velocity) over mere rapid output (speed).'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: When I talk with my team about the concept of moving fast, I never use the
    term speed. I always use the term velocity. Speed is just the speed of movement.
    Velocity is speed plus direction.

    but about making failures cheaper and faster so more experiments can be run.'

    across all departments, not just engineering.'

    in whatever they do. I don't care if you're whatever, if you're joining the league

    value proposition, linking professional survival to self-discovery of core human
    attributes.

    gained from solving hard problems, not just being first to market.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The second advantage is they don't know what we know because we're ahead of

    capability.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I was on a call with a massive bank this morning, and they were like, Harry,

    notes that AI bypasses the attribution mechanism (copyright) that allowed the
    printing press era to flourish.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you look at the arc of advancement of humanity... What changed the pace
    of advancement of humanity was the printing press because it allowed for the distribution
    of knowledge... With AI is it jumped over the hoop of attributing anything to
    anyone.

    because we're producing content, and that content is going to be eaten by a machine
    and used to produce new stuff.
  topic: adoption/business

summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Fiverr CEO on AI Disruption, Adaptation, and Startup
  Survival


  This episode of 20VC features Michaelfman, Founder and CEO of Fiverr, in a candid
  discussion sparked by his viral post urging professionals to adapt to AI or face
  obsolescence. The conversation centers on the immediate and brutal impact of generative
  AI on the job market, the necessary mindset shift for survival, and the resulting
  dynamics in the startup ecosystem.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **General Tech and Business Strategy in the Age of AI**. Key
  themes include workforce adaptation, the speed of technological iteration ("Time
  to Copy"), the sustainability of the current AI startup boom, and the enduring importance
  of human capital and brand equity over easily replicable technology.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **AI Forces Rediscovery of Humanity:** If AI automates routine functions, human
  value shifts entirely to non-linear thinking, advanced taste, ethical judgment,
  and unconventional ideation—the aspects that cannot be easily automated.

  *   **Shortened Development Horizon, Unchanged Core Challenge:** AI has dramatically
  lowered the initial barrier to entry ("lift to 300 feet from the peak"), making
  it easy to build a product. However, the core challenge of **distribution, marketing,
  and building true defensibility** remains at the "peak," which is now harder to
  reach due to market saturation.

  *   **Technology Democratization:** When foundational technology (like LLMs) is
  democratized (e.g., offered for free like OpenAI initially did), it elevates the
  standard for everyone but offers no inherent competitive advantage, forcing focus
  back onto human-centric elements.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **The AI Startup Bubble:** Kauffman predicts a massive "cleanup" in the AI startup
  space, stating that **99% of current AI companies will die** because they are building
  marginal advancements without true differentiation or defensibility.

  *   **Defensibility Shifts:** Traditional defensibility based on speed of cloning
  is gone (time to clone is now ~10 days). Defensibility accrues instead in the mid-spectrum:
  collecting, cleansing, and utilizing high-quality customer data, and building strong
  brand/distribution.

  *   **Investment Thesis: People Over Product:** In a world where technology is easily
  copied, investment decisions must revert to the oldest principle: backing exceptional
  people (missionaries, adaptable leaders) who can navigate existential crises. He
  cites an example of investing in a company that "should have died seven times" but
  survived due to the strength of its team.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Michaelfman (Fiverr CEO):** The central voice, advocating for radical personal
  responsibility in professional development amidst AI disruption.

  *   **Chegg:** Mentioned as a company whose business model was demonstrably killed
  by AI, serving as a cautionary tale.

  *   **OpenAI/Anthropic/Google:** Mentioned as potential foundational players in
  the AI infrastructure layer, possibly evolving into a utility model (paying for
  GPU cycles).

  *   **Etsy:** Referenced via an anecdote about its early investors valuing its resilience
  despite near-death experiences.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion briefly touches on the future role of governments, with Kauffman
  predicting that **governments will eventually take control of AI**, suggesting that
  the power and potential risk of the technology will necessitate centralized oversight.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward a period of **ruthless consolidation and cleanup**
  among AI startups. Survival will depend not on the novelty of the AI implementation,
  but on superior human capabilities (strategy, taste, ethics) and established moats
  like brand and distribution. The current environment is likened to the dot-com boom,
  where massive failure will precede the emergence of foundational giants (like Amazon
  from the dot-com crash).


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Startup Founders, Technology Executives, Venture
  Capitalists, and Mid-to-Senior Level Professionals** whose roles are susceptible
  to automation. It provides a stark strategic framework for adaptation and investment
  filtering in the current AI landscape.


  ---


  ### Comprehensive Summary Narrative


  The episode opens with the explosive catalyst for the discussion: Michaelfman’s
  blunt assertion that professionals must adapt to AI or be "done," emphasizing that
  the responsibility for upskilling lies solely with the individual, not their employer.
  He frames this as an "awakening," rejecting the notion that companies are responsible
  for making employees valuable; rather, if employees automate 100% of their current
  tasks, they free up time to focus on uniquely human, non-linear strategic work.


  Kauffman draws a direct parallel between the current AI frenzy and the **dot-com
  era**, noting the unsustainable influx of new companies (40 new startups daily in
  his feed) that often lack meaningful differentiation beyond applying a new technology
  layer. He argues that while AI has lowered the *cost and time to build* a product,
  it has simultaneously **eroded the time to clone**, meaning traditional competitive
  advantages based on early lead time are vanishing.


  For investors, this means that technology itself is no longer a differentiator.
  Kauffman advises focusing exclusively on the **quality and resilience of the founding
  team**. He shares a personal story of an investment that nearly failed multiple
  times but succeeded wildly due to the team''s sheer tenacity, suggesting that the
  ability to survive existential threats is the ultimate metric of quality in the
  current environment.


  Looking ahead, Kauffman is certain of a market cleanup, predicting that **99% of
  current AI companies will fail** because they are opportunistic rather than missionary.
  The surviving foundational players will likely be those who control infrastructure
  or possess deep, non-replicable moats like brand and proprietary data utilization.
