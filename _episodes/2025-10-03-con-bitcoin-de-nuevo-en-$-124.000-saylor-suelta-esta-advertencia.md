summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Con Bitcoin de nuevo en $124.000 Saylor suelta
  esta advertencia


  This episode of *Crypto Mercado Cipimés* focuses heavily on Bitcoin''s recent price
  surge, technical analysis suggesting potential continuation, and broader market
  developments, including institutional adoption and significant movements in the
  DeFi/Layer 2 space.


  The main narrative arc centers on Bitcoin briefly touching the **$124,000** level
  (though the host seems to reference a previous high near $129,000 or $120,000 in
  context, noting the current movement is significant). The host emphasizes the importance
  of the **weekly closing price** for Bitcoin, suggesting that if it closes near the
  current highs, it would represent the largest weekly candle in history, signaling
  strong bullish momentum.


  A key feature of the episode is the introduction of a **proprietary predictive model**
  that has historically forecasted the peak price of previous bull runs (2017 and
  2021). This model is now suggesting a price target for the current cycle, which
  began in November 2022, and this analysis is being exclusively shared in the host''s
  premium newsletter.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  Cryptocurrency market analysis, focusing primarily on **Bitcoin (BTC)** price action,
  technical indicators, institutional investment (ETFs), and comparative performance
  across major altcoins and Layer 2 solutions.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Weekly Closing Significance:** The potential for Bitcoin to achieve its largest-ever
  weekly candle close is highlighted as a major bullish confirmation for the coming
  weeks, despite recent minor pullbacks.

  *   **Historical Parallels:** The host draws comparisons between the current price
  action and the explosive growth seen in October 2017, when BTC rose from around
  $4,300 to over $17,700 in a single month.

  *   **Predictive Model:** A new, unshared model is mentioned, which has successfully
  predicted previous cycle tops and is now projecting a target for the current bull
  run''s final movement.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **ETF Inflows:** Bitcoin ETFs in the US saw a very positive day with over **$627
  million** in inflows, indicating strong institutional demand.

  *   **October Performance:** October is historically a strong month for Bitcoin,
  averaging over 28% profitability since 2010.

  *   **Short Squeeze Context:** Significant short positions (bets against BTC) have
  been liquidated, with billions being "barred from the game," suggesting that the
  recent price surge overcame significant bearish sentiment.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy):** Mentioned in the context of his consistent
  Bitcoin accumulation strategy; the host implies Saylor''s advice is to "preserve
  Bitcoin."

  *   **MARA (Marathon Digital):** Updated its September data, increasing its strategic
  Bitcoin reserve to **52,850 BTC**.

  *   **Tether (USDT):** Reportedly seeking a financing round that values the company
  highly, potentially placing it as the **fourth largest financial company globally**
  (behind JPMorgan, Visa, and Mastercard), showcasing massive crypto adoption value.

  *   **Samsung:** Announced integration of Coinbase''s cryptographic access into
  75 million Galaxy devices.

  *   **Binance:** Shared historical data on BTC performance in past Septembers.

  *   **Venue (VNT):** Mentioned for breaking its historical All-Time High, surpassing
  $1,150.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The episode briefly touches on the **US Federal Government shutdown**, noting that
  authorities suggest it could last until the 15th, but stressing that the market
  currently views this as **irrelevant** to crypto price action.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests an **optimistic outlook** for Bitcoin, driven
  by institutional inflows and strong technical patterns. The potential valuation
  of Tether indicates that the financial integration of crypto entities is rapidly
  accelerating, placing them alongside traditional financial giants. The introduction
  of the predictive model hints at potentially much higher price targets for the current
  cycle.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Investors and Traders** who rely on technical analysis, market structure,
  and institutional flow data to make short-to-medium-term decisions. Professionals
  interested in the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets will also
  find the Tether valuation relevant.'
