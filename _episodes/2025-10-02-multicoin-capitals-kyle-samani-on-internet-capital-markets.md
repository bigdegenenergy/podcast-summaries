summary: '# Multicoin Capital''s Kyle Samani on Internet Capital Markets - Comprehensive
  Summary


  ## Focus Area

  This episode centers on the convergence of blockchain technology and regulatory
  reform to create "internet capital markets" - a vision for global, 24/7, programmable
  financial infrastructure built on crypto rails. The discussion spans DeFi protocols,
  tokenized securities, regulatory frameworks, and the transformation of traditional
  finance through blockchain technology.


  ## Key Technical Insights

  • **Blockchain Infrastructure Maturity**: Modern blockchains like Solana can now
  process over 1 billion transactions daily at under a penny per transaction, finally
  achieving the scale and cost efficiency needed for internet-scale capital markets

  • **Regulatory Super App Framework**: SEC Chair Paul Atkins outlined a unified platform
  approach allowing three distinct asset types (non-security crypto assets, tokenized
  securities, and traditional securities) to trade on one interface despite different
  underlying backends

  • **On-Chain Securities Migration**: The SEC is actively updating regulations to
  enable securities markets to move on-chain, representing the first fundamental infrastructure
  change in nearly 100 years


  ## Market/Investment Angle

  • **Generational Inflection Point**: 2025 represents the first time in a century
  that technology capabilities and regulatory frameworks have aligned, creating conditions
  similar to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that unleashed the internet

  • **Legacy System Displacement**: Rather than adapting, traditional financial intermediaries
  (exchanges, clearing houses, custodians) will be "consumed" by programmable blockchain
  infrastructure that eliminates rent-seeking layers

  • **Media-Finance Convergence**: Prediction markets and embedded trading will fundamentally
  reshape media consumption, with financial primitives becoming integrated into news,
  sports, social media, and entertainment platforms


  ## Notable Companies/People

  **Key Figures**: Kyle Samani (Multicoin Capital founder), SEC Chair Paul Atkins,
  David Sacks (credited with helping secure Trump''s crypto executive orders)

  **Traditional Platforms**: Robinhood, Coinbase, SoFi positioned as emerging "regulatory
  super apps"

  **Crypto Protocols**: Gido, Drift, Camino, Kalshi mentioned as DeFi platforms that
  will integrate with regulated interfaces

  **Media References**: Jim Cramer, Roaring Kitty, Dave Portnoy cited as examples
  of entertainment-finance evolution


  ## Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  **Historical Foundation**: Current system built on 1930s legislation (Securities
  Act 1933, Exchange Act 1934, Investment Company Act 1940) following the 1929 crash,
  with 90 years of accumulated regulatory bloat

  **Recent Developments**: Trump''s crypto executive orders, the Genius Act creating
  stablecoin frameworks, and the expected Clarity Act addressing crypto market structure

  **SEC Transformation**: Chair Atkins explicitly directing staff to update "antiquated
  agency rules" to enable on-chain software systems, preparing for the "digital finance
  revolution"


  ## Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is moving toward ubiquitous financial primitives
  embedded in all software experiences - from news articles enabling instant interest
  rate betting to group chats facilitating sports wagering to live streams enabling
  collaborative trading. This represents a fundamental shift from siloed financial
  markets to finance as an internet-native primitive accessible globally with just
  a phone and internet connection.


  ## Target Audience

  This content is most valuable for crypto/DeFi professionals, traditional finance
  executives evaluating blockchain adoption, regulatory affairs specialists, and fintech
  entrepreneurs building at the intersection of traditional and decentralized finance.

  ## Comprehensive Analysis


  Kyle Samani''s presentation at Summit represents a watershed moment thesis for the
  financial industry, arguing that 2025 marks the convergence of technological capability
  and regulatory alignment necessary to rebuild capital markets from first principles.
  His central argument is that the current financial system, built on 1930s crisis-response
  legislation, has accumulated nearly a century of inefficient intermediation that
  blockchain technology can now eliminate.


  The historical context Samani provides is crucial to understanding the magnitude
  of proposed change. The 1929 stock market crash led to foundational legislation
  creating the SEC and establishing disclosure requirements, but also initiated a
  pattern of adding "rule after rule, system after system" that created layers of
  rent-seeking intermediaries. Today''s markets still close at 4 PM, charge high fees,
  and take two days to settle trades - inefficiencies that seem absurd in a world
  of instant digital communication.


  The technical breakthrough Samani highlights is blockchain scalability reaching
  internet-scale requirements. Solana''s ability to process over a billion daily transactions
  at sub-penny costs represents the infrastructure maturity needed to support global
  capital markets. This isn''t just about cryptocurrency trading, but about rebuilding
  the entire stack of financial services on programmable, permissionless infrastructure.


  Perhaps most significantly, Samani details unprecedented regulatory alignment under
  the Trump administration and SEC Chair Paul Atkins. The "regulatory super app" framework
  represents a pragmatic approach to bridging traditional and crypto-native finance,
  allowing users to access DeFi protocols through regulated platforms without requiring
  multiple licenses. This regulatory clarity addresses the primary barrier that has
  prevented institutional adoption of blockchain-based financial infrastructure.


  The media-finance convergence Samani envisions extends far beyond traditional trading
  platforms. His examples of betting on Federal Reserve decisions while reading financial
  news, wagering on sports plays during live broadcasts, and trading assets within
  group chats illustrate how financial primitives will become embedded throughout
  digital experiences. This represents a fundamental shift from finance as a specialized
  domain to finance as ubiquitous internet infrastructure.


  The presentation concludes with a bold prediction that legacy financial'
