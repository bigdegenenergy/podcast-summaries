summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Inside the FBI: Crypto, Crime and National Security


  This 52-minute episode features an in-depth conversation between Jonathan Loven
  (CEO/Co-founder of Chainalysis) and James Monaco (Deputy Assistant Director of the
  FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division), detailing the FBI''s evolution in combating
  cybercrime, particularly focusing on the pervasive role of cryptocurrency.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area:**

  The primary focus is the **FBI’s strategy and operational response to crimes involving
  cryptocurrency**, spanning from early darknet market usage to modern, sophisticated
  schemes like ransomware and investment fraud (specifically "pig butchering"). The
  discussion centers on integrating blockchain analysis into traditional criminal
  investigations across nearly all FBI classifications.


  **2. Key Technical Insights:**

  *   **Ubiquity of Crypto in Crime:** Cryptocurrency is now involved in approximately
  **170 out of 250** FBI investigative classifications, with over 2,500 active investigations
  incorporating crypto components.

  *   **Centralized Expertise & Field Support:** The FBI established a **Virtual Assets
  Unit (VAU)** at headquarters to centralize expertise, supported by a "hub and spoke"
  model utilizing several hundred agents across field offices in the **Virtual Currency
  Response Team (VCRT)** for local blockchain tracing support.

  *   **Proactive Intelligence Gathering:** The ability to trace real-time money flows
  on the blockchain provides critical intelligence about the **entire supply chain**
  of criminal operations (e.g., ransomware actors or fraud compounds), moving investigations
  beyond relying solely on delayed victim reporting.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle:**

  *   **Ransomware Recovery Success:** The FBI has demonstrated significant success
  in recovering illicit funds, citing an example where **$12 million out of a $15
  million ransomware payment was recovered** due to early victim engagement and tracing
  capabilities.

  *   **Fraud Escalation:** Crypto investment fraud (pig butchering) losses reported
  to IC3 reached approximately **$5.8 billion in 2024**, marking a **48% year-over-year
  increase**, highlighting a massive and growing financial threat.

  *   **Private Sector Necessity:** Success in combating these crimes is heavily reliant
  on **public-private partnerships**, leveraging tools and relationships from exchanges
  (VASPs), tracing companies, and major tech infrastructure providers.


  **4. Notable Companies/People:**

  *   **James Monaco (FBI DAD):** Provided the primary insights into the FBI''s organizational
  structure, training evolution, and operational challenges regarding crypto crime.

  *   **Jonathan Loven (Chainalysis CEO):** Hosted the discussion, framing the context
  through Chainalysis’s role in providing tracing tools and industry expertise.

  *   **IC3 (Internet Crime Complaint Center):** The central reporting mechanism for
  victims of fraud and cybercrime.

  *   **Hexigate/Venus Protocol:** Mentioned in the pre-roll as an example of Chainalysis/Hexigate''s
  early detection capabilities successfully safeguarding $13 million in a social engineering
  attack.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  *   **Inter-Agency Cooperation:** The FBI actively manages working groups (e.g.,
  Ransomware, Terrorism Fundraising) to ensure collaboration between intelligence
  and criminal investigative arms, as well as with federal partners (Secret Service,
  HSI, Postal Inspection Service).

  *   **Victim Engagement Initiative ("Level Up"):** This joint government/private
  sector initiative proactively contacts potential victims of pig butchering. In 15
  months, they contacted over 6,300 people, with **76% unaware they were victims**,
  leading to an estimated **$275 million in losses averted**.

  *   **Discouraging Ransom Payments:** While the FBI encourages institutions not
  to pay ransoms for business continuity reasons, they emphasize the importance of
  immediate reporting to maximize recovery chances.


  **6. Future Implications:**

  The industry is moving toward **proactive disruption** based on real-time blockchain
  intelligence rather than reactive investigation based on late victim reports. The
  sophistication of transnational criminal enterprises, including those utilizing
  forced labor in overseas fraud compounds, requires sustained, deep collaboration
  between global law enforcement and the private sector infrastructure providers.


  **7. Target Audience:**

  **Cybersecurity Professionals, Financial Crime Compliance Officers, Law Enforcement/Government
  Officials, and Crypto Investors/Analysts** interested in the nexus of national security,
  regulatory enforcement, and blockchain tracing methodologies.


  ---


  **Comprehensive Narrative Summary:**


  The episode chronicles the FBI''s nine-year journey from viewing cryptocurrency
  as a niche tool for darknet markets to recognizing it as an enterprise-wide threat
  vector. Deputy Assistant Director James Monaco detailed how crypto initially landed
  within the Money Laundering program due to its function in value transfer, but quickly
  expanded its footprint.


  The initial FBI strategy focused heavily on **education**, deploying small teams
  to conduct "Cryptocurrency 101" training across field offices. This evolved into
  a more structured approach with the creation of the **Virtual Assets Unit (VAU)**,
  co-locating experts from Cyber, Counterintelligence, and Criminal divisions. This
  VAU now manages the VCRT, a network of hundreds of field agents trained in blockchain
  tracing, acting as the central resource for the Bureau''s 2,500+ crypto-involved
  investigations.


  Monaco highlighted the success against **ransomware**, emphasizing the FBI’s dual
  role as an intelligence and investigative body, which facilitates collaboration
  with intelligence agencies against nation-state actors. The success in recovering
  millions in ransom payments underscores the value of early engagement with victims.


  The most pressing current challenge discussed was **crypto investment fraud, or
  "pig butchering,"** which saw reported losses surge to $5.8 billion. The FBI’s **"Level
  Up" initiative** exemplifies the necessary public-private synergy, proactively identifying
  and warning victims before they lose'
