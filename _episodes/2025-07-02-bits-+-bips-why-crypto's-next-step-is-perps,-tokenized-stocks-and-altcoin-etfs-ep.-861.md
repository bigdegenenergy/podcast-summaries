    acceptance and the blurring of traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto rails.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced

    risk-averse firms to severely limit their scope to avoid jeopardizing their core
    business.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It became very clear through a variety of different actions that the US regulators
    consider Jane Street to be a US person, which meant that if you wanted to build
    a fully compliant business, which Jane Street is, like that is what they do. It
    doesn't make sense for a firm as big as Jane to take headline risks or regulatory
    risks in something like crypto and risk the rest of the franchise.

    a few firms could manage it initially.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: part of the reason why the Bitcoin ETFs worked as well as they did is because
    of Jane's balance sheet. Like the back end where the cash to crypto lay was still

    somebody to send a billion dollars off the door and then hope to get somebody

    many different places of the world at the same time, you can't get deterministic
    in terms of, you know, using the time as the, as a priority.
  topic: technology/scalability
- impact_reason: A sharp critique comparing DeFi exchange costs (high fees + wide

    fees and tight spreads), showing where DeFi currently lags in trading efficiency.

summary: '## Bits + Bips: Why Crypto''s Next Step Is Perps, Tokenized Stocks and Altcoin
  ETFs - Ep. 861 (Comprehensive Summary)


  This episode of Bits + Bips, featuring host James Seyffart and guests Ram Alawalia,
  Noel Atchison, and Thomas Um (CCO of the Gido Foundation, formerly of Jane Street),
  explores the accelerating convergence of traditional finance (TradFi) and crypto,
  focusing on the emergence of perpetual futures, tokenized equities, and the broader
  implications for market structure.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **collision of crypto and macro**, specifically analyzing
  the rapid adoption of derivative products (perpetual futures) and the tokenization
  of real-world assets (RWAs), particularly stocks, within the blockchain ecosystem.
  It also touches upon Solana market structure and the competitive landscape between
  centralized exchanges (CEXs) and DeFi.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Solana Priority Mechanism:** The yield on Lido (Gido) on Solana primarily
  comes from **Gido Tips** paid by market makers and HFTs to ensure transaction inclusion
  and priority, as blockchains cannot rely on the deterministic time-priority mechanisms
  common in traditional CLOBs (Central Limit Order Books).

  *   **Token Programmability:** The key technical advantage of tokenized stocks over
  traditional shares is **programmability and composability**—the ability to use them
  as collateral in DeFi protocols (like Morpho) or integrate them into novel financial
  applications, which traditional custody prevents.

  *   **TradFi Efficiency vs. DeFi Fees:** Traditional equity markets, especially
  the US market, demonstrate superior liquidity and tighter spreads (often trading
  at mid-spreads for retail), highlighting areas where DeFi still lags centralized
  systems, despite lower *stated* fees on some crypto exchanges.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Perpetual Futures as the Next Frontier:** Perpetual futures are highlighted
  as a massive, potentially world-eating product category, especially as major platforms
  like Robinhood plan to introduce retail-friendly versions in the EU, and Coinbase
  plans US launches.

  *   **Tokenized Stocks as an Access Play:** While tokenizing deep-liquidity assets
  like MSTR or TSLA offers little immediate liquidity benefit, the primary driver
  is **access** for non-US investors and the potential for 24/7 trading.

  *   **The Super App Thesis:** Major platforms (Robinhood, Coinbase/Base, X) are
  aggressively building integrated "super apps" that bundle payments, trading, and
  crypto services, aiming to capture user convenience and control the entire financial
  stack.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Robinhood:** Mentioned for its significant product launch, including introducing
  perpetual futures and tokenized stocks in the EU, and crucially, announcing plans
  to build its **own blockchain** to control its tokenization efforts.

  *   **Gido Foundation (Thomas Um):** Discussed in the context of Solana market structure
  and how Gido tips function as a priority fee mechanism.

  *   **Jane Street (Thomas Um''s former firm):** Noted for its crucial role in providing
  the balance sheet and cash-to-crypto leg necessary for the successful creation of
  Bitcoin ETFs, demonstrating the continued reliance on sophisticated TradFi infrastructure.

  *   **ByBit:** Mentioned for launching **ByBit Earn** (ByBrill), allowing stock
  trading directly on Solana via partners like Kamino.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **US Regulatory Impact on TradFi Crypto:** Thomas Um detailed how US regulators
  viewing Jane Street as a "US person" severely constrained their ability to build
  a fully compliant crypto derivatives business, forcing them to limit activity primarily
  to CME futures, illustrating the friction points for large institutions engaging
  with crypto.

  *   **Political Shift:** The panel noted the surreal nature of the current political
  environment, where the sitting US President is engaging in forward guidance on crypto,
  suggesting that owning crypto is shifting from a purely speculative position to
  a necessary component of a globally diversified portfolio.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a **re-bundling** of financial services onto controlled,
  highly usable platforms (the super app model), even as the underlying technology
  (blockchain) was initially designed for decentralization. The convergence is accelerating,
  with TradFi giants like Schwab and Fidelity rapidly integrating crypto services,
  suggesting that the siloed era of crypto is ending. The ability to move tokenized
  assets *off* the issuing platform (e.g., taking tokenized Apple stock off Robinhood)
  is the key factor that will unlock true DeFi utility.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto and TradFi professionals, institutional
  investors, product managers, and market structure analysts** interested in the practical
  integration points between regulated finance and decentralized technology, particularly
  concerning derivatives and RWA tokenization strategies.'
