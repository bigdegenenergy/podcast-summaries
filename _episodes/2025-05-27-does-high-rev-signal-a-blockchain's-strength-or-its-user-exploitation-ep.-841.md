    economic activity and total volume, not just current, isolated cash flows (like
    today''s fees).'
  relevance_score: 10

    activity built through the users, the transaction volume, et cetera, and all of
    the future volumes and values that you think will come in the future, but not
    just some one individual level of cash flow today.
  topic: investment
- impact_reason: 'This is the mathematical punchline: showing that if crypto captures
    all global transaction/equity fees, the resulting revenue still leads to an extremely
    high revenue multiple (70X) relative to current asset values, questioning the
    valuation premise.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you're looking at $10 billion in fees in the future, steady state for everything,
    and versus $700 billion in assets, you can see why the numbers are really hard
    to make sense at a 70X revenue multiple.
  topic: investment
- impact_reason: This is a highly controversial and strong stance advocating for a
    monolithic settlement layer (Ethereum) and questioning the utility and value of
    most existing L2 tokens, suggesting they are centralized and unnecessary if they
    don't function as gas tokens or have meaningful governance.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I don't think any L2 should have tokens. Everything should be settlement.
    Ethereum should be one base layer. You're reaping all the call data fees in Ethereum.
    Eventually, the sequencers are all centralized. We haven't made—people would argue
    with me—I don't think we've made grow meaningful progress in that in a very long
    time, and all these tokens are not worth anything...
  topic: technology/scalability
- impact_reason: 'This is the central thesis of the debate: execution fees are unsustainable/transitory;
    the true value of an L1 asset is derived from the economic security it provides
    to the assets built upon it.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Any L1 fees are a meme and going to zero in my honest opinion, REV or otherwise.
    What matters is the amount of value you secure as a chain and the downstream economic
    security needed for the L1 asset to justify that security.
  topic: investment/strategy
- impact_reason: Proposes a novel valuation framework for L1 assets based on the value
    of the economic activity they secure, rather than the fees they collect.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The only metric that I could come up with with why these total assets should
    be valued, commensurate to billions or trillions of US dollars, is they have to
    be tied to the economic security of the underlying assets that actually transact
    and are built on that network.
  topic: investment/strategy
- impact_reason: Directly refutes the common investment narrative that increased Total
    Value Locked (TVL) automatically necessitates a proportional increase in the L1
    token price, highlighting a flaw in many crypto investment theses.

  text: As an investment thesis to say, if we are going to have, let's say, $10 trillion
    come onto Ethereum and trade on Ethereum, A-E-R-G-O, the price must go up. That's
    where I start running into issues.
  topic: investment
- impact_reason: 'This is a core argument for PoS security: the economic cost of acquiring
    control (via staking assets) drives the asset price up, increasing the cost of
    the attack itself.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But that's not possible on proof-of-stake networks, right? The act of acquiring
    enough Ether to attack Ethereum or acquiring enough SOL to attack Solana would
    send the asset price so astronomically high that effectively you gain more economic
    security in the process...
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: A highly skeptical and pragmatic view on validator motivation, suggesting
    financial incentives (price appreciation) dominate altruism in crypto security.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I have seen nothing in the history of crypto that shows that altruistic self-interest,
    altruistic lets better the network, it is pervasive in the space.

- impact_reason: A clear articulation of the thesis that value captured by sophisticated
    actors (like HFTs) should accrue to the underlying blockchain protocol rather
    than external third parties.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Does High REV Signal a Blockchain''s Strength or Its
  User Exploitation? - Ep. 841


  This 82-minute episode of *Unchained* features a deep-dive debate between **Tom
  Dunleavy** (Head of Ventures at Varys Capital) and **Austin Federer** (co-founder
  of 00) regarding the utility and valuation implications of **REV (Revenue)**, defined
  as **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) plus transaction fees**, as a metric for blockchain
  network strength. The discussion, sparked by a prior exchange on X, also touches
  heavily on the structure of Layer 2 (L2) ecosystems and the future of token utility.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **critique and re-evaluation of REV** as a core metric
  for valuing Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 blockchain assets. Secondary, but significant,
  topics include the necessity of L2 tokens, the concept of "protocolization" of off-protocol
  payments (like Lido tips), and alternative valuation frameworks for decentralized
  networks that move beyond traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) models.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **REV Definition Nuance:** The participants debated whether REV should include
  "out-of-protocol payments" like Lido tips, arguing that if a mechanism is widely
  adopted and integral to the network''s function (like Lido on Solana), it should
  be considered part of the economic activity, even if not explicitly internalized
  by all token holders.

  *   **L2 Token Utility Questioned:** Both guests strongly agreed that most L2 tokens
  are currently redundant or unnecessary. They argued that L2s should primarily function
  as settlement layers, potentially using the L1''s native token (like ETH) for gas/fees,
  suggesting a move towards a "base model" (like Coinbase''s Base, which lacks a native
  token).

  *   **The Rise of Base Rollups:** The conversation noted that the industry is already
  moving toward "firing the L2s" through the adoption of **base rollups** on Ethereum,
  which integrate execution and sequencing directly into the base layer, potentially
  rendering many current L2 tokens obsolete.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Fees Headed to Zero:** Tom Dunleavy argued that execution fees, priority fees,
  and even MEV are likely to trend toward zero over the long term, making traditional
  revenue/DCF models useless for valuing these assets.

  *   **Security as the Valuation Anchor:** The core investment thesis presented by
  Dunleavy is that L1 assets should be valued based on the **economic security they
  secure** for the underlying assets built on the chain, rather than current fee generation.
  This security component is unique to blockchains and not comparable to traditional
  equities.

  *   **Valuation Disconnect:** The sheer scale of potential global transaction volume
  (equities + credit cards) suggests a maximum annual fee pool of only around $10
  billion, which is difficult to reconcile with current L1 market caps ($700B+ aggregate),
  especially when considering the ancillary monetization in traditional finance (lit/dark
  pools, HFT infrastructure).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Austin Campbell (NYU Professor):** Mentioned in the intro regarding his interview
  on the stablecoin bill banning yield-bearing stablecoins.

  *   **Haseeb Qureshi (Dragonfly Capital):** Initiated the debate and provided questions,
  pushing a skeptical view on the importance of REV.

  *   **Tom Dunleavy & Austin Federer:** The central debaters, representing differing
  perspectives on how to quantify network value.

  *   **Coinbase/Base:** Cited as a model for L2s that forgo a native token, relying
  instead on the L1 (Ethereum) for settlement.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The episode briefly touched upon user comments regarding the **stablecoin bill**
  banning yield-bearing stablecoins, highlighting the tension between user innovation
  and banking stability concerns.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where:

  1.  **Fee revenue metrics (REV) become increasingly irrelevant** for long-term L1
  valuation as execution costs drop.

  2.  **Economic security**—the cost/incentive structure required to maintain consensus
  integrity—will become the dominant framework for assessing the intrinsic value of
  L1 assets like ETH and SOL.

  3.  The L2 landscape will consolidate, likely favoring L1-native solutions (like
  base rollups) over L2s with separate, potentially useless, native tokens.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Investors, Blockchain Architects, Protocol
  Developers, and Financial Analysts** specializing in digital assets who are seeking
  sophisticated, non-consensus frameworks for valuing decentralized infrastructure.'
