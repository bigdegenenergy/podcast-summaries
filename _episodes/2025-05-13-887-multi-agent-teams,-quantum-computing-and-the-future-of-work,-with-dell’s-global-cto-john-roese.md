    be done to accomplish that complex task. But because they're agents, they're going

    was everybody else for working with us to allow us to focus and get these done.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: 887: Multi-Agent Teams, Quantum Computing and the Future
  of Work, with Dell’s Global CTO John Roese


  This episode features John Roese, Global CTO and Chief AI Officer at Dell Technologies,
  discussing his strategic approach to AI adoption, the critical need for measurable
  ROI, and the future convergence of advanced technologies like multi-agent systems
  and quantum computing.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Enterprise AI Strategy and Implementation**, specifically
  focusing on:

  *   **AI Prioritization and ROI:** Moving beyond abstract excitement to concrete
  business value.

  *   **Escaping POC Prison:** Establishing clear criteria for transitioning AI experiments
  into scaled production.

  *   **Multi-Agent Systems:** Their anticipated impact on enterprise workflows.

  *   **Future Technology Convergence:** The entanglement of Quantum Computing and
  AI.

  *   **Workforce Transformation:** The emergence of new job roles and shifts in labor
  demand (e.g., construction).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **The ROI-Driven Funnel:** Dell filtered 800 initial GenAI ideas down to 8 high-impact
  projects by prioritizing those directly tied to measurable business outcomes (profit,
  revenue, cost reduction) rather than abstract possibilities.

  *   **Criteria for Production Readiness:** Escaping POC prison requires meeting
  strict criteria: demonstrable material ROI, alignment with the company''s *future*
  desired operating model (not just patching old processes), and meeting security/compliance
  standards.

  *   **Foundational Technology Reuse:** A successful AI flywheel relies on subsequent
  projects reusing the foundational technology stack established by earlier successful
  deployments, lowering cost and increasing speed.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Strategic Focus Areas:** Dell concentrated its initial high-impact AI efforts
  on core differentiators: Supply Chain, Sales, Services, and Engineering, as these
  areas drive the most significant commercial success.

  *   **The ROI Flywheel:** Starting AI initiatives with projects that yield tangible
  ROI (fuel) is crucial, as this success generates the budget and momentum needed
  to fund secondary, goodwill-focused projects later.

  *   **Differentiation as a Litmus Test:** Organizations must first identify their
  core source of differentiation; AI efforts should be explicitly connected to improving
  that unique capability (e.g., for universities, it’s attracting faculty/producing
  top graduates, not just operational efficiency).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **John Roese (Dell Technologies):** Global CTO and Chief AI Officer, driving
  Dell''s future tech strategy and AI adoption framework.

  *   **Dell Technologies:** The context for the 800-to-8 idea filtering process and
  the successful deployment of tools like "Dell Sales Chat."

  *   **Nvidia:** Mentioned as a key partner in enabling enterprise AI solutions (via
  the Dell AI Factory sponsorship mention).


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a maturation phase for enterprise AI, moving from broad
  experimentation to disciplined execution. The future will see:

  *   **Widespread adoption of Multi-Agent Teams** automating complex workflows.

  *   **Increased demand for roles** that bridge technology and tangible outcomes,
  potentially leading to unexpected job growth in sectors like construction due to
  AI-driven efficiency gains.

  *   **A critical entanglement between Quantum Computing and AI**, where advances
  in one will dramatically accelerate the other, fundamentally changing technological
  capabilities.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Technology Executives (CTOs, CIOs), AI Strategy
  Leaders, and Enterprise Architects** who are responsible for allocating resources,
  proving AI value, and scaling successful proofs-of-concept within large organizations.'
