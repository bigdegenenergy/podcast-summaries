  text: First, persistent inflation. Despite central banks' efforts, inflation remains
    sticky above target. Fiscal deficits aren't shrinking. This Goldilocks inflation,
    high enough to erode cash, but not high enough to trigger poor volkostyle 20%
    interest rates, is kind of a sweet spot for Bitcoin and other cryptos.

    wealthy Chinese are seeking stores of value outside the mainland. Capital controls
    make traditional assets difficult, but crypto offers a backdoor.

    periods of extreme global monetary policy divergence and uncertainty.

    currency volatility. In a society where fiat currencies are increasingly unstable

summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - Global inflation remains sticky (G20 average near 3.8%) due to a collision of
    massive fiscal stimulus, supply chain chaos, and commodity shocks (like the Ukraine
    war).
  - Corporate profits, rather than just wages, were a major driver of recent inflation,
    with firms exploiting supply shocks to increase margins.
  - China is trapped in malign, demand-driven deflation following its property sector
    collapse, leading to massive overcapacity in manufacturing and a deep confidence
    crisis.
  - Unlike the 1970s stagflation, current inflation is being contained by anchored
    long-term expectations and a rapid, aggressive monetary tightening cycle by Western
    central banks.
  - China's deflationary exports and collapsing demand for commodities are exerting
    disinflationary pressure globally, complicating the job of Western central banks.
  - Structural forces like climate change ('heatflation'), the energy transition ('greenflation'),
    and declining fossil fuel investment ('fossilflation') suggest persistent inflationary
    pressures moving forward.
  - The divergence between tightening Western central banks and easing Chinese banks
    marks the end of synchronized global monetary policy, creating volatility attractive
    to uncorrelated assets like crypto.
  overview: 'The global economy is fracturing into two distinct halves: one struggling
    with persistent inflation driven by simultaneous fiscal stimulus, supply shocks,
    and geopolitical events, and the other facing severe demand-driven deflation stemming
    from China''s property market collapse. This unprecedented divergence in monetary
    policy—with Western central banks tightening while China eases—signals the end
    of the synchronized global economic cycle and places structural stress on the
    existing financial system. The resulting uncertainty, currency instability, and
    the search for non-sovereign stores of value create a surprisingly bullish macro
    environment for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.'
