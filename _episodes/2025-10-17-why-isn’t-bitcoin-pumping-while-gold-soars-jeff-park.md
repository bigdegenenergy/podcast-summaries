    peer into it, they don't like what they see. Oh, you mean all the tribalism and
    battling and, you know, when Bitcoiners fight other Bitcoiners about, for example,
    the spam filter, even if it's coming from a good place, it exposes like an open

    But I actually just don't think this is always true. I think gold is very special,

    that the goals of debt management and monetary policy are inherently linked, a
    key debate in modern macroeconomics.

  text: One is ultimately motivated by lowering the debt interest burden, right? That's
    the Treasury's function. But the central bank is on the other side of it. And
    it's so obvious to anyone who's understood history that those two things and functions
    are absolutely related, which is why I think this notion of Fed independence,
    we need to kind of move beyond it.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why Isn’t Bitcoin Pumping While Gold Soars?
  | Jeff Park


  This 41-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast features host Anthony Pompliano (Pomp)
  and Jeff Park, CIO of ProCAP BTC, engaging in a macro-level discussion focusing
  on the divergence between gold''s recent strength and Bitcoin''s lagging performance,
  framed by global financial plumbing and geopolitical instability.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Global Macroeconomics and Digital Assets**, specifically
  analyzing the current state of the US Dollar, the role of gold as a safe haven asset,
  the mechanics of global central bank liquidity (swap lines), and the potential future
  role of Bitcoin within this established financial architecture, drawing parallels
  with historical central banking evolution (e.g., the Bank of England).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Swap Lines as Dollar Plumbing:** Swap lines are detailed as the critical cross-currency
  mechanism central banks use to ensure the flow of US dollars when local systems
  fracture, acting as a backstop of confidence in the dollarized global economy.

  *   **SDRs vs. Bitcoin:** Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), an IMF invention based
  on a basket of five major currencies, are presented as the closest historical parallel
  to a neutral reserve asset, similar to what Bitcoin *could* become, but lacking
  Bitcoin''s transactional finality.

  *   **Bitcoin as Pristine Collateral:** The conversation suggests Bitcoin''s future
  utility at the nation-state level might evolve beyond a mere store of value into
  a liquid, pledgeable asset usable within international financial plumbing (like
  the Exchange Stabilization Fund), similar to how gold is currently used.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Gold''s Psychological Dominance:** Gold''s superior performance is attributed
  to its long-standing role as the most "obvious and sure thing" during moments of
  global chaos (Argentina, China, Ukraine), driven by psychological investor demand
  for certainty.

  *   **Liquidity Fuels Risk Assets:** General market thesis suggests that increased
  credit creation and liquidity, whether from the US or China (reopening unused swap
  lines), remains fundamentally positive for risk assets.

  *   **Central Bank Adoption is Key:** The ultimate catalyst for Bitcoin''s next
  major move is posited to be significant involvement and adoption by central banks,
  mirroring the historical path of gold, which transitioned from a private asset to
  a government reserve.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jeff Park (ProCAP BTC):** The guest, providing the macro analysis and perspective
  on Bitcoin''s role in global finance.

  *   **Janet Yellen (US Treasury Secretary):** Mentioned in the context of potentially
  using SDRs from the Exchange Stabilization Facility (ESF) to intervene in foreign
  markets like Argentina.

  *   **Bank of England:** Used as a historical case study illustrating the 250-year
  arc of a central bank evolving from a private, gold-backed enterprise to a nationalized
  entity following massive sovereign debt accumulation.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Argentina''s Dual Exchange Rates:** The discussion highlights Argentina''s
  economic dysfunction through its official vs. "blue chip swap rate" (black market
  rate), illustrating the failure of managed fiat currency.

  *   **Trade War as Capital War:** Geopolitical conflicts, such as the US-China trade
  disputes, are framed as evolving into capital account wars, where nations negotiate
  the flow and security of investment capital alongside trade goods.

  *   **Fiscal Dominance:** Both the US and China are exhibiting signs of fiscal dominance,
  where monetary policy is increasingly subservient to government spending needs,
  leading to greater liquidity creation.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that while Bitcoin is currently lagging gold due to gold’s
  established psychological moat, Bitcoin’s potential lies in its ability to serve
  as a *more functional* reserve asset than the SDR construct. The industry is heading
  toward a phase where nation-states may begin using Bitcoin not just as a store of
  value, but as a liquid, transactional collateral asset in international finance,
  starting at the B2B or sovereign level before individual adoption.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto/Web3 Professionals and Institutional Investors** focused on macro strategy,
  asset allocation, and the intersection of sovereign finance with digital assets.'
