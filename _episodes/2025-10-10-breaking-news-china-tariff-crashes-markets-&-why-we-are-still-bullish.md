    bullish indicator for Bitcoin.

  text: And the big thing that I still really like about Bitcoin is that we're coming

  text: My only fear with Aster is we have another analyst on the team named Roe Heat,
    and he was saying that some of those DeFi companies that record statistics like

    here. This might be a top signal.'

    and we came up here and rejected and rejected until we eventually broke through.
    And ever since then, we've been using this prior all-time high resistance level
    as a new found support zone right over in here, and we've been bouncing off of

summary: '## Podcast Summary: BREAKING NEWS: China Tariff CRASHES Markets & Why We
  Are STILL BULLISH


  This episode of the Crypto 101 podcast addresses a sudden, sharp market downturn
  triggered by breaking news regarding escalating trade tensions between the US and
  China, specifically concerning potential new tariffs announced by former President
  Trump via a lengthy social media post. Despite the immediate "Fear, Uncertainty,
  and Doubt" (FUD) causing a sell-off across crypto, equities, and metals, the hosts
  maintain a fundamentally **bullish long-term outlook**, arguing the dip is a temporary
  reaction to macro noise rather than a derailment of the broader market structure.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Cryptocurrency Market Analysis** in the context of **Global
  Macroeconomic Events** (US-China trade relations). Secondary topics include technical
  analysis (TA) of Bitcoin and Ethereum, altcoin performance divergence, and a specific
  discussion on security threats (SimSwap attacks).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin Support Structure:** Bitcoin is currently testing critical support
  levels. The immediate zone is around **$117K** (prior local high/20-day MA), with
  major, high-conviction support clustering around **$110K** (including prior all-time
  highs, higher lows, anchored VWAP, and the 200-day MA).

  *   **Ethereum Resistance/Support:** ETH is approaching its primary support range
  between **$4,100 and $3,800**, a zone that previously acted as strong resistance.
  A bounce here is highly anticipated.

  *   **Altcoin Health Indicator:** The key metric for altcoin health is the ability
  to form **higher lows** relative to their previous bottoming points. If altcoins
  (like Solana) can establish higher swing lows, it significantly increases the probability
  of a continued upside move for the broader crypto market.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Tariff Impact Context:** The market reaction mirrors previous tariff-related
  sell-offs earlier in the year, where assets like Bitcoin saw significant drawdowns
  (around 40% from peaks). However, the hosts believe a crash of that magnitude is
  unlikely this time.

  *   **Risk-Off Environment:** The news immediately pushed investors into a risk-off
  mode, causing crypto (which had outperformed indices recently) to sell off harder
  than traditional assets.

  *   **Bullish Thesis Resilience:** The overall bullish structure remains intact.
  The hosts argue that only a "black swan event" (massive escalation) would derail
  the current market trajectory; a political tweet is viewed as noise or "another
  episode in the reality show TV administration."


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump/President Xi:** Central figures driving the immediate market
  catalyst via social media posts regarding tariffs and trade war escalation.

  *   **FANI:** Mentioned as a sponsor, highlighted for offering guaranteed protection
  against SimSwap attacks, backed by up to $5 million in insurance.

  *   **Plus500 Futures:** Sponsor promoting accessible futures trading across crypto,
  indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ), and commodities without needing a crypto wallet.

  *   **Aster (Project):** Discussed in response to an audience question. Noted for
  strong buying pressure around $1.50 but cautioned due to potential wash trading
  activity related to an upcoming airdrop, which might inflate reported metrics.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion focused less on formal regulation and more on **geopolitical policy
  impact** (tariffs) being delivered via unconventional means (social media/X), forcing
  markets to digest information rapidly and publicly rather than through traditional
  closed-door negotiations.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The immediate focus shifts to the potential US-China meeting scheduled in **South
  Korea (Seoul)**. The hosts suggest that the market narrative for the next two weeks
  will revolve around whether this meeting proceeds and what outcomes arise, which
  will dictate the next major macro catalyst. Technically, the market is poised for
  a bounce if key support levels hold.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Investors and Traders** who rely on **Technical Analysis (TA)** and **Macroeconomic
  Context** to navigate short-term volatility while maintaining a long-term bullish
  conviction in the digital asset space.'
