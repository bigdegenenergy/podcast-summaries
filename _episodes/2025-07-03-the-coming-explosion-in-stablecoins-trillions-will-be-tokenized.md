  text: I realized after the Cyprus banking crisis and the financial crisis that nobody

    it needs to be a neutral counterparty, I guess, or a neutral infrastructure layer,

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: The Coming Explosion in Stablecoins: Trillions
  Will Be Tokenized


  This 74-minute episode of "The Journeyman," hosted by Raul Powell, features an in-depth
  conversation with **Chad Cascarilla**, Co-founder of Paxos, tracing the evolution
  of digital assets from early Bitcoin adoption to the current push for institutional
  tokenization and stablecoin infrastructure. The central narrative revolves around
  the necessity of building neutral, regulated, and robust blockchain infrastructure
  to support the tokenization of the nearly $900 trillion global asset base.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **intersection of Macroeconomics, Crypto/Web3 infrastructure,
  and the Exponential Age of Technology**, specifically concentrating on the development
  and institutional adoption of **stablecoins and asset tokenization**. The discussion
  heavily emphasizes the need for regulated, neutral infrastructure layers to replace
  legacy financial plumbing (like COBOL mainframes).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **The Plumbing Problem:** The core issue highlighted is that legacy financial
  plumbing (pre-blockchain systems) exacerbates crises because asset ownership and
  risk location are opaque (as seen during the 2008 crisis), necessitating socialized
  risk. Blockchain infrastructure aims to solve this by providing real-time, programmable
  asset movement.

  *   **Infrastructure Neutrality:** The conversation stresses that for mass adoption,
  the underlying infrastructure (custody, stablecoin issuance, settlement) must be
  **neutral and non-competitive** with the firms building on top of it (e.g., brokers,
  retail apps). This is why Paxos focuses on being a utility provider rather than
  solely an end-user platform.

  *   **Tokenization Scope:** Tokenization extends beyond just dollars (stablecoins)
  and includes tokenized US equities (which Paxos previously piloted with a no-action
  letter) and tokenized physical assets like gold (approaching $1 billion tokenized).


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Institutional Inflow via Infrastructure:** The current explosion is being
  driven by large TradFi and FinTech firms (PayPal, Mastercard, Interactive Brokers,
  Nubank) using regulated infrastructure providers like Paxos to offer crypto services
  to their existing customer bases.

  *   **Stablecoin as the Core Utility:** Stablecoins are positioned as the most immediate
  and necessary application of blockchain infrastructure, acting as the digital dollar
  rails for both crypto-native firms and traditional entities needing to settle transactions
  digitally.

  *   **The Value of Regulatory Clarity:** Paxosâ€™s successful navigation of the regulatory
  landscape, including establishing the first crypto trust in New York (predating
  the BitLicense), underscores that institutional adoption requires building compliant,
  high-quality services, even if it means moving slower than purely decentralized
  counterparts.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Chad Cascarilla (Paxos Co-founder):** The central guest, detailing his journey
  from shorting the subprime market to co-founding itBit, which evolved into Paxos.
  He champions regulated, neutral infrastructure.

  *   **Ameet Walia:** Cascarilla''s partner, co-founder of Cedar Hill Capital, and
  current head of Liberty City Ventures (crypto VC arm).

  *   **Paxos Clients/Partners:** PayPal, Mercado Libre, Venmo, Interactive Brokers,
  Nubank, Stripe, Mastercard, Robinhood, Kraken, J.P. Morgan, and Fiserv, illustrating
  the breadth of institutional integration.

  *   **Gary Gensler:** Mentioned critically regarding the expiration and subsequent
  hostile treatment of Paxosâ€™s prior no-action letter concerning tokenized equities.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion highlights the **critical role of regulation** in unlocking institutional
  capital. Paxosâ€™s strategy was explicitly built around achieving regulatory compliance
  (e.g., the NY Trust charter). The episode notes the regulatory setback in the US
  regarding tokenized equities due to the current SEC leadership, contrasting it with
  Paxosâ€™s existing regulatory frameworks in New York, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi (for
  yield-bearing products).


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly predicts a future where **trillions of dollars in assets
  are tokenized**, facilitated by robust, neutral infrastructure. The industry is
  hitting a moment of mass adoption where the foundational plumbing needs to be standardized
  and reliable, moving beyond the initial retail-focused phase. The future of finance
  is envisioned as open, programmable, and interoperable, built on these new digital
  rails.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Financial Professionals, Institutional Investors,
  FinTech Executives, and Crypto Infrastructure Builders** who need a deep understanding
  of the regulatory and business strategy behind institutional digital asset adoption,
  particularly concerning stablecoins and tokenization frameworks.'
