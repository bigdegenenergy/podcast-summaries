    So if you take that as a given, then the question is, if I'm going to pay somebody

    one, three-ish percent on that. I could take that staked ETH DeFi asset, I can

    percentage points. So now I'm earning yield on my ETH. I'm long ETH versus fiat,
    but I need to spend some fiat. You don't need to go to 7-Eleven, buy a coffee,

  text: I am a sort of US dollar stablecoin maxi. I don't think anyone wants anything
    other than that because, you know, in most places around the world, the domestic
    banking system, well-flawed as it is, is quite fast and efficient to send your

    100k is next based on money printing." Yeah. Most people saying this is nonsense,
    this is crazy. Now it's 100k. Okay, 1 million is next. Probably. I mean, there's
    no reason why it's not going there, and then there's no reason why it doesn't

    crypto (high growth/risk) and the other is ultra-safe fiat/gold hedges, minimizing
    exposure to traditional banking risk.

    fiat stuff. And if you look at that portion, it's basically just T-bills and gold
    and gold miners. And so, you know, I have a crypto portion, and it's done very

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: E142: Arthur Hayes: Buy Bitcoin Before 2028
  (if you want to get rich)


  This episode features Arthur Hayes, CIO of Maelstrom and co-founder of Bitmax, discussing
  his macro outlook, investment philosophy, and strong conviction in Bitcoin as the
  ultimate safe-haven asset amidst global fiat currency debasement.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Macroeconomics, Asset Allocation, and Cryptocurrency
  Investment Strategy**, with a heavy emphasis on Bitcoin''s role as a superior store
  of value compared to traditional assets (fiat, gold, equities) in the current monetary
  environment driven by government money printing.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin''s Proven Durability:** Bitcoin is highlighted as the "safest thing"
  to invest in due to its 15 years of "rock-solid" technology since the Genesis block,
  contrasting it with the high risk of speculative tokens ("shitcoins") which often
  go to zero.

  *   **The Stablecoin Macro Narrative:** Hayes is extremely bullish on the US Dollar
  stablecoin ecosystem (USDE, USDC, USDT) as a direct beneficiary of global de-dollarization
  pushback. He sees massive growth potential in the stablecoin market cap as they
  become the preferred dollar alternative for people outside the US banking system.

  *   **Focus on Infrastructure over Issuance:** Hayes believes the opportunity lies
  not in backing new stablecoin issuers (as Tether, Circle, and Athena dominate distribution),
  but in the **technology layer** (like Codex) that allows small businesses to seamlessly
  accept stablecoins while meeting fiat tax and regulatory obligations (the TradFi/crypto
  interface).


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Bitcoin as the Benchmark:** Hayes mandates that all investment decisions at
  Maelstrom are benchmarked against Bitcoin. If an investment cannot outperform holding
  Bitcoin, the capital should simply be deployed into Bitcoin.

  *   **Bear Market Buying Strategy:** Hayes’s firm is currently *not* active in seed/pre-seed
  deals because current valuations are too high. He predicts a **generational collapse
  in all assets between 2029 and 2030**, which he identifies as the prime time to
  "start buying week one" when "there''s blood in the streets."

  *   **Short-Term "Shitcoin" Trading:** While the core wealth is in BTC, Maelstrom
  actively engages in high-risk, short-term (2-3 year exit window) trading of speculative
  tokens with the explicit goal of converting profits back into Bitcoin.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Arthur Hayes:** CIO of Maelstrom, co-founder of Bitmax, and inventor of the
  perpetual swap. His investment philosophy is driven by fiat liquidity analysis.

  *   **Athena (USDE):** Hayes identifies this stablecoin issuer as a top conviction
  bet, noting its governance token is poised to perform well as the project scales
  and potentially executes buybacks.

  *   **Codex:** A project Hayes is advising and betting on, focused on building the
  functional layer for small businesses to bridge stablecoin acceptance with fiat
  compliance.

  *   **Rahul Pal:** Mentioned as another figure who is "all in crypto," often discussing
  five-year outlooks.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Political Drivers of Money Printing:** Hayes bases his macro thesis on the
  stated intentions of politicians globally—to fund large initiatives (re-industrialization,
  welfare, war) without raising taxes, necessitating continuous fiat creation.

  *   **The 2028 Election as a Potential Turning Point:** He speculates that the US
  2028 election could be the inflection point where the market *perceives* a shift
  away from aggressive money printing, which would trigger the major asset collapse
  he anticipates for 2029/2030.

  *   **US Dollar Stablecoin Dominance:** Hayes is a "US dollar stablecoin maxi,"
  arguing that global users outside the US need the dollar for its low inflation and
  access to US assets, not local currency stablecoins.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  Hayes projects that the current environment of aggressive fiat creation will continue
  until approximately **2027/2028**, leading to a market peak around that time, followed
  by a severe, generational asset collapse in **2029/2030**. He believes Bitcoin will
  continue to outperform all other inflation hedges (like gold) until this perceived
  end of the money-printing era. He dismisses the idea that Bitcoin is "too expensive"
  now, asserting that relative to future fiat debasement, it is still "early."


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Investors, Hedge Fund Managers, Macro Strategists, and Financial Professionals**
  focused on long-term asset preservation and high-conviction bets within the digital
  asset space.'
