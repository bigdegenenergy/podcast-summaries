summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Next Fed Chair Pick Could Lead To a MASSIVE
  Bull Run!


  This 20-minute podcast episode from Coin Bureau focuses on the potential candidates
  for the next Federal Reserve Chair, analyzing how the selection—particularly if
  made by President Trump—could drastically impact financial markets, including cryptocurrencies.
  The core narrative revolves around the market anticipation of Jerome Powell’s departure
  (May 2026) and the immediate pricing-in of a successor''s potential monetary policy
  leanings, even before an official announcement.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area:**

  The primary focus is **Macroeconomics and Monetary Policy**, specifically analyzing
  the potential impact of the next US Federal Reserve Chair appointment on interest
  rates, bond yields, the US Dollar (DXY), and risk assets like stocks and Bitcoin/crypto.


  **2. Key Technical Insights:**

  *   **Yield Curve Inversion Signal:** Scott Bessent highlighted that the two-year
  Treasury yield being lower than the Fed Funds rate (an inversion) strongly signals
  the Fed is being too slow to cut rates, a historical indicator of necessary Fed
  shifts.

  *   **Treasury Issuance Tactics:** Bessent''s strategy of skewing Treasury issuance
  toward short-term duration acts as a "Treasury put," artificially holding down long-term
  yields and lowering overall interest rates, mimicking a Fed easing action.

  *   **Regulatory Impact on Yields:** Proposed relaxation of bank leverage ratio
  rules could directly reduce the 10-year Treasury yield by 10 to 50 basis points,
  providing an additional tailwind for lower rates independent of Fed action.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle:**

  *   **Dovish Chair Favors Risk Assets:** Candidates leaning dovish (like Waller
  or Hassett) are expected to lead to lower short-term yields, a weaker dollar, and
  a natural bid for crypto and stocks.

  *   **Hawkish Chair Triggers Repricing:** A surprise appointment of a hawk like
  Kevin Warsh would likely cause an immediate repricing: stronger dollar, lower growth
  stocks, and restrictive policy pricing well into 2026, negatively impacting crypto
  sentiment.

  *   **Shadow Chair Effect:** The market is already pricing in the expected policy
  of potential successors (like Waller), treating Powell as a "lame duck" whose remaining
  actions carry less weight.


  **4. Notable Companies/People:**

  *   **Jerome Powell:** Current Fed Chair whose term ends in May 2026; President
  Trump has publicly expressed a desire to replace him.

  *   **Christopher Waller:** Current Fed Governor, considered the current favorite;
  his recent dovish comments on tariffs and rate cuts caused immediate market swings
  (2-year yield dropped 20 bps).

  *   **Kevin Warsh:** Former Fed Governor, consistently more hawkish; highly critical
  of easy money cushioning fiscal policy.

  *   **Scott Bessent:** Treasury Secretary; his focus on liquidity, short-term issuance,
  and expected September cuts signals a strong risk-on environment if appointed.

  *   **Kevin Hassett:** Director of the National Economic Council; a pure dove prioritizing
  growth, advocating for immediate rate cuts.

  *   **David Malpass:** Former World Bank President; a dark horse candidate favoring
  aggressive growth-focused rate cuts.

  *   **Betting Markets:** Polymarket and Calshi were cited as key tools for distilling
  information and tracking the odds of these nominees.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  The discussion heavily featured the tension between monetary policy (Fed) and fiscal
  policy (Treasury/White House). Warsh’s critique centers on the Fed cushioning "bad
  fiscal policy with easy money." Furthermore, potential regulatory changes, such
  as relaxing bank leverage ratios, are viewed as policy tools that can influence
  interest rates alongside Fed rate decisions.


  **6. Future Implications:**

  The industry is heading toward a period of high uncertainty dictated by political
  maneuvering. If Trump announces a successor early, the market will rapidly shift
  expectations. A dovish appointee promises a "massive bull run" fueled by cheaper
  liquidity, while a hawkish pick signals a sharp tightening of financial conditions
  and a significant headwind for risk assets. The speed at which Fed commentary (especially
  Waller''s) translates into price action suggests high volatility around Fed-related
  news.


  **7. Target Audience:**

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto Investors, Macro Traders, and Financial
  Professionals** who need to understand the intersection of US political appointments,
  central bank policy, and their direct impact on asset valuations.'
