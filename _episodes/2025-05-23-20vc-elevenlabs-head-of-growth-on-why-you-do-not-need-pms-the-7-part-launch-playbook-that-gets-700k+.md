summary: '## 20VC: ElevenLabs Head of Growth on Why You Do Not Need PMs | The 7-Part
  Launch Playbook That Gets 700K+ Views Per Product | The Truth About CAC, Payback
  & Performance Marketing in AI with Luke Harries


  This 75-minute episode of 20VC features Harry Stebings in conversation with Luke
  Harries, Head of Growth at the rapidly scaling AI audio company, ElevenLabs. The
  discussion centers on high-velocity growth strategies, organizational structure
  in fast-growing tech companies, and the specific marketing tactics that propelled
  ElevenLabs to massive visibility.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Growth Strategy and Execution in AI/Deep Tech**, specifically
  examining how ElevenLabs managed hyper-growth with a broad product portfolio. Key
  themes include organizational design (the debate over Product Managers), content
  marketing (especially video launches), performance marketing economics in AI, and
  lessons learned from previous startup ventures (Fellas).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Horizontal AI Foundation:** ElevenLabs succeeded with a broad product strategy
  because its core offering—state-of-the-art audio AI models (text-to-speech, voice
  cloning, etc.)—acts as a foundational API layer, allowing them to build discrete,
  specialized products (consumer app, creator platform) on top.

  *   **Sharded Growth Teams:** To manage the complexity of multiple product lines
  (developer API, consumer app, creator tools), the growth function is "sharded."
  Each product line has its own dedicated growth lead (acting as a CMO for that product)
  supported by horizontal channel specialists (Performance Marketing, SEO).

  *   **Motion Design as a Launch Keystone:** Video, particularly motion design (animated
  graphics), is considered the most critical marketing piece for major launches, capable
  of conveying complex value propositions quickly and cost-effectively compared to
  paid advertising.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Counter-Narrative to ICP Focus:** Harries acknowledges that traditional advice
  favors a tight Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), but ElevenLabs’ success stems from
  leveraging a superior foundational technology to serve multiple, distinct ICPs simultaneously,
  funded by significant venture capital.

  *   **High ROI of Launch Videos:** Launch videos, especially motion design pieces,
  generate views (often 200K to 700K per launch) at a significantly lower effective
  Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) compared to traditional paid channels like Facebook
  ads.

  *   **Patience in Market Timing:** Reflections on the Fellas journey highlight that
  market timing is crucial; early entry into the GLP-1/weight loss space was too early,
  but patience allowed the market to mature, leading to massive success for later
  entrants (Curative).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **ElevenLabs:** The central company, valued at $3.3B, known for its leading
  AI audio models.

  *   **Luke Harries:** Head of Growth, formerly at PostHog and Microsoft.

  *   **Matty (Co-founder, ElevenLabs):** Met Harries at a Cambridge hackathon; pitched
  the 11 Labs vision in a Hampstead Pond swim.

  *   **Philip (Co-founder, Wordware):** Also met at the hackathon; Wordware achieved
  a record YC raise.

  *   **Curative/Fred Turner:** Mentioned as a company that pivoted successfully into
  COVID testing, contrasting with Harries'' non-profit approach during the same period.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that for foundational AI technologies, a horizontal strategy
  supported by deeply specialized, sharded growth teams can be highly effective, challenging
  the conventional wisdom of strict product focus. Furthermore, the emphasis on high-quality,
  short-form video content (motion design) as a primary driver for product discovery
  indicates that organic reach via compelling creative assets will remain vital, even
  as supply increases.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Growth Leaders, Product Executives, AI Founders,
  and Venture Capitalists** interested in scaling deep-tech companies, organizational
  design, and cutting-edge marketing execution.

  ### Comprehensive Summary Narrative


  The episode opens with an introduction to Luke Harries, Head of Growth at ElevenLabs,
  detailing his background and the company’s rapid ascent. The initial discussion
  pivots to Harries'' early career, including a formative hackathon where he met Matty
  (ElevenLabs co-founder) and Philip (Wordware founder), underscoring the value of
  early networking.


  Harries then offers deep reflections on his previous venture, Fellas. He recounts
  the challenges of building an AI developer tool pre-LLM boom, a detour into setting
  up non-profit COVID testing clinics (where he learned about the pitfalls of beta
  testing during a crisis), and the subsequent pivot into the men''s weight loss space
  just before the GLP-1 (Ozempic) wave hit. The key lesson here was the critical importance
  of **market timing** and the need for founders to commit to a long-term vision,
  as his impatience led him to step back prematurely while the market was just beginning
  to mature.


  The core of the conversation addresses ElevenLabs'' seemingly counter-intuitive
  strategy: **being horizontal** (offering multiple distinct products—API, consumer
  app, creator tools) rather than focusing on a single ICP. Harries explains this
  works because the underlying technology is a superior, foundational AI layer. To
  manage this complexity, ElevenLabs employs a **sharded growth structure**. Instead
  of a single generalist team, they have dedicated growth leads for each product line
  (Consumer, Creator, Developer, Enterprise), who act as CMOs for their segment, supported
  by horizontal channel specialists (Performance Marketing, SEO).
