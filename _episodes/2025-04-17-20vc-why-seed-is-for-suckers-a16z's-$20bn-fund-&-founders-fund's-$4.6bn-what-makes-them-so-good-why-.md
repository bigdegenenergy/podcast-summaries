summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: The Shifting Sands of SaaS, AI Disruption, and
  VC Strategy


  This episode of the 20VC podcast, hosted by Harry Stebbings, features a candid discussion
  with venture capital heavyweights **Jason Calacanis** and **Rory O’Driscoll (GP
  at Scale)**. The central narrative arc revolves around the **death of first-generation
  SaaS investing metrics** due to market saturation and the radical disruption caused
  by generative AI, forcing VCs to underwrite significantly higher risk for potentially
  massive upside.


  ---


  ### Key Takeaways for Technology Professionals:


  #### 1. The End of Spreadsheet SaaS Investing

  * **Obsolescence of Old Rubrics:** The traditional SaaS playbook—relying heavily
  on metrics like Net Revenue Retention (NRR) and predictable growth rates (e.g.,
  the "1 to 10 in five quarters" S-tier benchmark)—is declared "dead."

  * **Market Saturation:** Existing SaaS markets (like document signing or basic cloud
  migration) have largely saturated. Companies that once achieved predictable "triple,
  triple, double, double" growth are now flattening out at lower rates (e.g., $50M
  ARR growing at 10-20%).

  * **Actionable Insight for SaaS Founders:** While traditional, high-growth SaaS
  companies with proven models are still viable and attractive to investors like Rory
  O''Driscoll, the real challenge lies with the vast number of mature, slower-growth
  SaaS companies that lack the "AI magic pixie dust" story needed to excite momentum
  investors.


  #### 2. AI''s Impact: Transient Product-Market Fit (PMF)

  * **Rapid Evolution:** Unlike previous SaaS cycles where products remained static
  for years (e.g., Box, DocuSign), AI-native startups are experiencing PMF that can
  be gained and lost in weeks or months.

  * **Underwriting Extreme Volatility:** This rapid change, driven by model progress
  and evolving user understanding of AI capabilities, means VCs are underwriting significantly
  more risk at every stage. The upside remains huge, but the downside risk is amplified.

  * **Founder Intensity:** The current environment demands extreme founder dedication.
  The best AI SaaS startups are characterized by intense, 7-day-a-week work schedules,
  contrasting sharply with the more relaxed pace seen in some 2021 startups.


  #### 3. Strategic Shifts in Venture Capital

  * **Risk vs. Reward Reassessment:** VCs acknowledge they know significantly less
  about the long-term viability of AI companies than they did about established SaaS
  models at similar stages. They are underwriting higher risk for a potentially larger
  upside. The concern is whether current high valuations adequately compensate for
  this increased risk.

  * **Bimodal Outcomes:** The increased risk and elongated holding periods are predicted
  to lead to more **bimodal results** across the VC landscape, meaning more funds
  will significantly underperform as portfolio construction becomes critical in a
  riskier game.

  * **The Momentum Shift:** A significant portion (estimated 70-80%) of established
  cloud SaaS investors are now exclusively focused on AI deals, unwilling to look
  at traditional SaaS, driven by the desire for rapid, massive returns (e.g., tripling
  in eight months).


  #### 4. The Liquidity Crisis for Mature SaaS

  * **The $2 Trillion Problem:** A massive amount of capital (estimated at $1 to $2
  trillion) is tied up in mature, slower-growth SaaS and cloud companies that are
  too large for small exits but lack the growth profile for current IPO windows.

  * **Grim Industrial Work Ahead:** Exits for this cohort will require "grim industrial
  work"—grinding toward profitability, pursuing Private Equity (PE) exits, or executing
  private-to-private consolidations.

  * **PE Indifference:** A major concern highlighted is the **lack of "tire-kicking"
  from PE firms** for these sub-scale, non-hyper-growth SaaS companies. PE firms often
  prefer boring, vertically focused software with high market share where they can
  raise prices, which are precisely the companies that fail to achieve the billion-dollar
  outcomes VCs fund.


  #### 5. Mentioned Thought Leaders and Frameworks

  * **Key Personalities:** Harry Stebbings, Jason Calacanis, Rory O’Driscoll (GP at
  Scale), and Victor Lazarte (Benchmark).

  * **Frameworks/Concepts:** The "1 to 10 in five quarters" S-tier metric (attributed
  to O’Driscoll), and the concept of underwriting risk against inflated upside in
  the current market.

  ### Context and Significance

  This conversation is vital for technology professionals because it confirms a major
  inflection point: the playbook that generated massive wealth in the 2010s SaaS boom
  is functionally over. Founders and investors must now navigate an environment defined
  by **speed, volatility, and technological paradigm shifts (AI)**, where traditional
  financial guardrails are less reliable, and operational intensity is paramount.
  The discussion also signals potential future challenges in the mid-market SaaS sector
  regarding capital realization and exit pathways.'
