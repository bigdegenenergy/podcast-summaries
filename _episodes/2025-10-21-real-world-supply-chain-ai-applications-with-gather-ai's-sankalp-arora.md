  text: For them, the problem we are solving is bridging the gap between what their
    WMS says and what actually happens in the warehouse so that they can increase
    the throughput of their warehouses, increase on-time in-full while reducing the
    pressure on their labor.
  topic: business
- impact_reason: 'This is the core AI prediction: Digitization leads to data centralization
    (''source of truth''), which then enables autonomous decision-making via ''AI
    agents'' for operational improvement.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: As we digitize each of your workflows in the warehouse, I think the as we
    become the source of truth of what's happening in your warehouse and your operations,
    you will see a team of AI agents from us working on that data and making decisions
    on your behalf or making your recommendations on how to improve your warehouse
    on a day-to-day basis.
  topic: predictions/technical

    gap, quantifying the financial impact of inventory inaccuracy on a fundamental
    warehouse operation (picking).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: let's talk about a simple pick process. And you go to pick up a pallet or
    pick up a case. And the picker says, I can't find the case here, whereas the warehouse
    management system says it is here. Because some error happened by putting away
    that case. Suddenly that pick becomes two to three times more expensive than what
    it needed to be in the first place.
  topic: business
- impact_reason: Directly links inventory inaccuracy to failure in meeting modern
    e-commerce fulfillment deadlines (OTIF), highlighting the severity of the problem.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced

    by their software across existing material handling equipment (forklifts, docks)
    rather than requiring proprietary hardware, making deployment scalable.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We put our software powering commercial off-the-shelf cameras on forklifts,
    on docks, and on drones so that each of these pick, outbound, inbound, staging,
    and replant processes are captured on camera by capturing where a thing was picked
    up from, where it was put away, how many cases were there, what were the dimensions,
    was it damaged or not.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: Translates the previous percentage into a concrete dollar figure
    for a hypothetical large retailer, making the financial risk immediately apparent.

    half a billion dollars of extra inventory in their warehouse.
  topic: business
- impact_reason: Illustrates the dramatic shift in performance expectations (the 'bar
    rising') in logistics, moving from acceptable error rates (85-90%) to near-perfect
    execution (99.99%).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: the pressure of on-time in full, as I say, go if you do 85 to 90% on-time
    in full, it used to be that you're okay as a warehouse. But now you have to be
    fairly close to 99.99 to make your customers happy.

    accommodating necessary human override and tribal knowledge, which dictates system
    design flexibility.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But what we have discovered is there is also a lot of tribal knowledge in
    these facilities where yeah, the system says otherwise, but the operator knows
    for whatever reason it's the right place to work. So they can override it if they
    want, or if the management doesn't want us to let them override, they don't.
  topic: Strategy/Adoption
- impact_reason: 'This is the core strategic insight: moving from post-facto inspection
    (costly, reactive) to process monitoring and improvement (proactive), mirroring
    major regulatory shifts in other industries.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think what you guys are saying is you can't inspect the quality. It's a
    cost that you have to go back. And it was a major mind shift, mindset shift. We
    also saw it in the Food Safety Modernization Act... We're going to improve the
    process. And we're going to monitor the process and then prove that we're monitoring
    the process.
  topic: Strategy/Mindset Shift

    Vision (Physical Intelligence) has matured enough to make proactive digitization
    cost-effective in industrial settings.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But AI and physical intelligence was not there yet to let them be proactive
    and digitize their workflows in a cheap and a cost-effective and a fashion. Now
    it is there so that wave is taking over our warehouse operations.
  topic: AI Trends/Predictions

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Real-World Supply Chain AI Applications with
  Gather AI''s Sankalp Arora


  This 52-minute episode of *Logistics of Logistics* features an in-depth discussion
  with **Sankalp Arora, Co-founder and CEO of Gather AI**, focusing on how their technology
  bridges the critical gap between the **physical reality of warehouse operations
  and the data recorded in Warehouse Management Systems (WMS)**. The core narrative
  revolves around how traditional, manual tracking methods lead to "leaky processes,"
  resulting in costly errors, delayed shipments, and operational inefficiency. Gather
  AI addresses this by using computer vision powered by AI to digitize workflows in
  real-time.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **real-world AI and Computer Vision applications within
  warehouse and supply chain operations**, specifically addressing inventory accuracy,
  process digitization, and improving On-Time In-Full (OTIF) performance. The discussion
  centers on moving warehouse management from a reactive, inspection-based model to
  a proactive, process-monitoring model.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Real-Time Workflow Digitization:** Gather AI uses commercial off-the-shelf
  cameras mounted on forklifts, drones, and docks to capture every movement (putaway,
  picking, staging, inbound/outbound). This captures *what actually happened*—including
  item location, quantity, and condition—rather than relying solely on manual scans.

  *   **AI-Powered Error Prevention and Correction:** The system detects errors (e.g.,
  placing an item in the wrong bin) as they occur. It alerts the operator via a screen
  (e.g., on a forklift) for immediate correction, or it updates the WMS record to
  reflect the *actual* location, ensuring subsequent picks are successful even if
  the initial transaction was erroneous.

  *   **Drone Efficiency for Inventory:** Utilizing American-made drones, the company
  achieves **25 times faster inventory counting** compared to manual methods, significantly
  reducing the need for costly, slow, and error-prone human cycle counting, often
  performed after hours.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Inventory as a Major Liability:** The discussion highlights that poor warehouse
  operations can result in retailers carrying **5% to 15% of their annual revenue
  in excess inventory**, emphasizing the massive financial impact of inaccuracy.

  *   **OTIF Pressure:** Customer demands necessitate near-perfect OTIF rates (approaching
  99.99%), forcing warehouses to evolve from being simple cost centers to critical
  performance drivers.

  *   **Labor Attraction and Retention:** Implementing advanced AI technology makes
  warehouse jobs more appealing to the modern workforce, positioning the role as technologically
  advanced rather than purely physical labor, which helps combat high churn rates
  (cited as up to 150% annually in some facilities).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Sankalp Arora (Gather AI):** Co-founder/CEO, background in Robotics (Carnegie
  Mellon Ph.D.), involved in building the world''s first fully autonomous helicopter.
  His motivation for founding Gather AI stemmed from realizing robots are exceptional
  physical data-gathering machines applicable to civil society problems like supply
  chain inefficiency.

  *   **NFI:** Mentioned as a case study where Gather AI drastically improved operations
  for a high-velocity customer (inventory turning over four times in six months).
  Gather AI reduced inventory counting hours by 75% and reduced the time to locate
  lost pallets from days to minutes.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving away from **post-facto inspection and auditing** (like traditional
  inventory control/QA) toward **proactive process monitoring and control**. AI and
  physical intelligence are enabling this shift, allowing companies to embed quality
  directly into the workflow rather than trying to inspect quality in later. This
  transformation is expected to become the standard for modern, high-speed fulfillment
  operations.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This podcast is highly valuable for **Supply Chain Executives, Warehouse Operations
  Managers, Logistics Directors, and Technology Leaders** interested in practical,
  deployed AI solutions that deliver measurable ROI in physical operations. It is
  also relevant for **Venture Capitalists** tracking innovation in industrial automation
  and logistics tech.'
