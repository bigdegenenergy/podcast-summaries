    bias toward fundamental valuation, which is highly relevant for assessing modern
    assets like tech stocks or potentially crypto.
  relevance_score: 9

    way of evaluating a company and buying it for less than it's worth? Right? I would

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Bitcoin’s $10K Candles Are Coming — Get Ready
  | Anthony & John Pompliano


  This 50-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast, featuring Anthony Pompliano and John
  Pompliano, centers on analyzing recent market volatility (specifically in Bitcoin)
  through the lens of geopolitical maneuvering, the Federal Reserve''s interventionist
  playbook, and the evolving maturity of the Bitcoin asset class.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)** and **Macroeconomics/Investment
  Strategy**. Key themes include the impact of political rhetoric (specifically related
  to US-China trade tensions) on short-term market movements, the long-term resilience
  of asset prices due to central bank intervention, and the changing nature of market
  volatility.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Liquidity Wipeout as a Market Reset:** The recent $19 billion liquidation
  event in crypto, despite causing a sharp drop in Bitcoin''s price ($121k to $108k),
  served to "wipe out all the excess leverage," positioning the market for potential
  upside.

  *   **24/7 Market Advantage:** Geopolitical events occurring outside traditional
  stock market hours (like the Friday-to-Sunday window) highlight Bitcoin’s 24/7 trading
  nature, driving more global participants toward crypto markets seeking immediate
  liquidity and execution.

  *   **Maturing Volatility:** Bitcoin is transitioning from percentage-based volatility
  to dollar-based volatility. While percentage moves may shrink as the asset matures
  (moving from "adolescent" to "adult" status, perhaps crossing $10T market cap),
  the dollar value of daily swings ($10K to $20K candles) will increase.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Pessimists are Wrong (Again):** The hosts argue that predictions of an imminent
  market crash or recession are outdated, as the Federal Reserve''s playbook is now
  firmly established: they will aggressively cut rates and deploy stimulus to prevent
  prolonged bear markets (18+ months).

  *   **Buy the Dip Mentality:** Retail investors have learned reflexivity—the faster
  assets fall due to short-term noise (like tariffs), the faster they rebound. This
  behavior supports immediate buying during dips.

  *   **Valuation Justification:** Current high valuation multiples in the stock market
  are justified because companies are achieving higher growth rates (e.g., 30% YoY)
  with greater efficiency (e.g., growing revenue with fewer employees, as seen with
  Palantir).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump:** Mentioned for his use of social media and presidential power
  to influence market sentiment and negotiate geopolitical issues, often timing announcements
  around market open/close.

  *   **Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase):** Cited as an example of a major financial figure
  acknowledging the current environment as a bull market.

  *   **Howard Marks (Oaktree Capital):** Noted for his recent comments suggesting
  he does *not* see a bubble or imminent crash, which is significant given his typically
  cautious stance.

  *   **Palantir:** Used as a prime example of modern corporate efficiency, demonstrating
  high growth while simultaneously reducing headcount.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion heavily implies that **monetary policy is the dominant force overriding
  traditional economic cycles.** The hosts assert that the Fed prioritizes preventing
  prolonged recessions and protecting asset prices over maintaining the purchasing
  power of the US Dollar (evidenced by the 30% loss in purchasing power over five
  years). This interventionist stance effectively "outlaws" long-term bear markets.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where asset prices are perpetually supported
  by central bank intervention, leading retail investors to adopt a "buy the dip"
  strategy as the default. Furthermore, the increasing utility of 24/7 markets (like
  Bitcoin) will become more apparent as global macro events occur outside traditional
  trading hours. Bitcoin is maturing but has not yet reached the "adult" stage where
  institutions and central banks fully commit.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Active Crypto Investors, Macro Hedge Fund Managers,
  and Financial Professionals** interested in the intersection of geopolitics, central
  bank policy, and digital asset valuation.'
