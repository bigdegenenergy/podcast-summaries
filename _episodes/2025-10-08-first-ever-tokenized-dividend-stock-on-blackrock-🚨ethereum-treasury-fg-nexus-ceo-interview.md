summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: First-Ever Tokenized Dividend Stock on BlackRock?🚨Ethereum
  Treasury FG Nexus CEO INTERVIEW


  This podcast episode features an in-depth interview with Maya, the CEO of **FG Nexus**,
  discussing the company''s groundbreaking move to natively tokenize its public shares,
  including dividend-paying preferred equity, on the **Ethereum** blockchain. The
  conversation centers on the intersection of traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized
  finance (DeFi), the infrastructure required for institutional adoption, and the
  strategic rationale behind FG Nexus''s ETH-centric treasury strategy.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Tokenized Securities and Real-World Assets (RWA)**, specifically
  the tokenization of publicly traded equity. Secondary themes include the strategic
  use of **Ethereum** as the underlying infrastructure for programmable finance, corporate
  treasury management in digital assets, and the evolving regulatory landscape for
  on-chain assets.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Programmable Dividends via Tokenization:** FG Nexus is tokenizing preferred
  shares on Ethereum to enable **near real-time settlement** and **streamed dividend
  payouts** directly to whitelisted investor wallets, bypassing slow, legacy intermediaries
  like transfer agents and clearing houses.

  *   **Maintaining Legal Integrity:** The tokenization process is designed to keep
  the **full transfer agent records** intact while leveraging Ethereum rails for transparency
  and efficiency, ensuring the tokenized shares retain the same legal rights as traditional
  shares.

  *   **Infrastructure Choice:** Ethereum was chosen specifically because it is a
  **programmable and yield-bearing asset**, positioning it as an infrastructure play
  rather than just a speculative price play for the treasury.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Institutional Validation:** The partnership with **Securitized** is highlighted,
  as Securitized is the tokenization provider behind BlackRock’s first tokenized fund,
  signaling institutional-grade compliance and scalability.

  *   **Treasury Strategy:** FG Nexus is actively building its treasury by **acquiring
  and staking ETH**, viewing this as a long-term play on the on-chain economy, differentiating
  them from competitors who may focus solely on short-term price action.

  *   **Acquisition Vehicle Potential:** Being a publicly traded vehicle allows FG
  Nexus to potentially act as an acquisition vehicle for other crypto-native companies
  looking to go public.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **FG Nexus:** The company pioneering the first NASDAQ-listed entity to fully
  tokenize dividend-paying preferred equity on Ethereum.

  *   **Securitized:** The regulated, end-to-end tokenization provider chosen by FG
  Nexus, noted for its work with BlackRock.

  *   **Key Backers/Partners:** Mentioned partners include **Galaxy** (treasury management),
  **Anchorage, BitGo, and Kraken** (custody), with investors including **Point 72
  and Citadel**.

  *   **Leadership Background:** The CEO emphasizes the team’s unique "nexus" of deep
  crypto experience (CEO''s background since 2010) and deep TradFi operational experience
  (team members from TD Ameritrade, Point 72).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **The Blend of KYC/Non-KYC:** The discussion acknowledges the existence of two
  parallel worlds: the fully decentralized, non-KYC crypto sphere, and the regulated
  TradFi-adjacent world (like Coinbase). The consensus is that the future is a **blend**,
  especially when massive TradFi players tokenize assets, which will likely necessitate
  KYC compliance.

  *   **Public Company Scrutiny:** As a publicly traded company reporting to the SEC,
  FG Nexus must be extremely cautious in exploring yield-generation opportunities
  (like DeFi), prioritizing staking with regulated partners (Anchorage/BitGo) over
  higher-risk DeFi protocols.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is moving toward **infrastructure-focused
  adoption** where established financial players leverage programmable blockchains
  like Ethereum. The CEO predicts a significant increase in **corporate treasuries
  launching their own blockchains and stablecoins** in the near future to gain yield
  on their assets. Furthermore, the tokenization of preferred equity sets a precedent
  for how established public companies might integrate blockchain technology for shareholder
  services.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Institutional Investors, FinTech Professionals,
  Blockchain Developers focused on RWA, and Corporate Strategy Executives** interested
  in the practical, regulated implementation of tokenization within public markets.'
