    fees are the most valuable revenue stream for a blockchain network.

    over, not really wanting to talk about for a long time.
  topic: investment/strategy
- impact_reason: Draws a clear distinction between valuing Bitcoin (as digital gold/store
    of value) and valuing platform technology, suggesting only one asset can truly
    dominate the 'digital gold' narrative.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There's digital gold, and what is the evaluation metric for that? I don't
    know. How do you want to value gold? You can apply that logical framework to digital
    gold, a store of value asset, a little bit one of a kind through the non-sovereign
    store of value. I think that's something people fundamentally understand, and
    there's room for one on that pedestal.
  topic: investment/strategy
- impact_reason: Emphasizes the need for separate valuation frameworks for different
    crypto asset classes (infrastructure vs. store of value).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Do you value financial infrastructure, platform technology, the same way you
    value a store of value asset? Of course, you don't.
  topic: investment/strategy

    appropriate for 2020's novelty phase, implying the industry must mature past it.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We've been talking about TVL for a long time. That's fine to talk about TVL
    starting in DeFi summer in 2020 when this thing was new and impactful. That was
    fine as a metric back in 2020 when you needed something to normalize these new
    phenomena that were popping up almost overnight.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: A strong argument against excessive fragmentation (e.g., running
    many independent execution layers), as it dilutes the primary revenue source for
    the base layer.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you take those execution transactions and distribute them across any number
    of sovereign execution environments, you give up that value capture.
  topic: technology/strategy
- impact_reason: Explains the difference between passive liquidity (low fee generation)
    and active liquidity (high fee generation), showing why TVL alone is insufficient.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If I have $100 million of TVL and I touch it once a year, that creates market
    depth for other market participants to trade against. It provides some baseline
    of liquidity... But if I touch that $100 million once, I pay fees on the way in
    and on the way out, meaning I pay fees twice over the course of an entire year.
  topic: defi/strategy
- impact_reason: Uses the Amazon precedent to counter the argument that focusing on
    revenue too early stifles innovation, suggesting high-growth companies must still
    generate revenue, even if profits are reinvested.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We already have the answer for that in Amazon, which famously said they expect
    to be loss-making for a long time. They wanted to have no profits for a long time,
    but they had plenty of revenue.

  topic: technology/strategy

    separately from application-layer revenue (trading cuts) or asset-layer revenue
    (like T-bills).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The revenue model for L1 protocols is fundamentally different, a function
    of priority fees and inflation. You need to distinguish these three components,
    as they make money in different ways.
  topic: technology/defi
- impact_reason: This is the core thesis about Pump.fun, suggesting a fundamental
    shift where cultural engagement and financial speculation are merging for a new
    generation of internet users.
  relevance_score: 9

  topic: Creator Economy/Web3

    (Perp trading vs. Meme coins), framing them both as gambling but with different
    psychological feels (poker vs. slot machine).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What I would say about meme coins versus perps is that it's all gambling.
    When you're trading 100x perps, you are gambling. Most people are losing money.
    The difference is that perp trading feels like poker, while meme coins look like
    slot machines.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Plasma''s Successful Launch, Revenue Over TVL
  & the Future of Pump.fun - Ep. 910


  This 87-minute episode features a three-part special, covering the launch of a new
  stablecoin blockchain, a fundamental shift in crypto valuation metrics, and a provocative
  thesis on the financialization of streaming platforms.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The episode focuses on three distinct, cutting-edge fronts in the crypto/Web3 space:

  1. **Stablecoin Infrastructure:** The launch and strategy of Plasma, a new stablecoin-focused
  Layer 1 blockchain.

  2. **Crypto Valuation Metrics:** A deep dive into why **Revenue** should supersede
  **Total Value Locked (TVL)** as the primary metric for valuing platform blockchains.

  3. **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Innovation:** A look into the potential for financializing
  social/streaming activities, specifically through the lens of **Pump.fun**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Plasma''s Monetization Model:** Plasma is designed around low/zero transaction
  fees (especially for USAT) to compete with traditional payments, forcing the ecosystem
  to monetize primarily through the **application layer**—a structural shift from
  traditional L1 fee capture.

  *   **L1 Revenue Components:** For platform blockchains like Solana, true revenue
  accruing to holders/stakers is derived from the sum of **Inflation (Protocol Parameter)**,
  **Base Fees**, and **Priority Fees**, with priority fees being the highest margin
  component.

  *   **TVL Gaming:** TVL is easily gamed because locking assets is often "free" (or
  low cost), whereas consistently paying transaction fees (revenue) requires active,
  recurring utility, making revenue a better indicator of sustained economic activity.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Plasma''s Competitive Edge:** Plasma''s main advantage is being the **first
  mover** with a live mainnet among the new wave of stablecoin-focused chains, coupled
  with deep alignment with Tether''s business development.

  *   **The Stablecoin Race:** The episode predicts massive growth in stablecoins,
  potentially exceeding the Treasury''s $2 trillion projection by 2028, driven by
  global dollarization efforts and the need for settlement layers (like Plasma) for
  emerging use cases like security token trading.

  *   **Valuation Evolution:** The industry is moving past the "seed stage" metric
  of TVL (2020 era) toward "Series A/B" metrics like revenue, signaling a maturation
  toward valuing actual utility capture over mere liquidity depth.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Plasma:** The first stablecoin-focused L1 to launch mainnet, aiming to facilitate
  low-cost USAT transfers and featuring the **Plasma One NeoBank** app (offering high-yield
  savings and global spending).

  *   **Tether (USDT/USAT):** Highly synergistic with Plasma due to team alignment
  and the upcoming launch of USAT, a Genius Act-compliant stablecoin for the U.S.
  market.

  *   **Lily Liu (Solana Foundation President):** Championed the argument for **Revenue**
  as the "north star metric" over TVL for platform blockchains.

  *   **Seth Gins (Coin Fund):** Provided analysis on Plasma''s launch, its successful
  ICO bootstrapping mechanism (requiring stablecoin deposits), and the geopolitical
  implications of dollarized savings.

  *   **James Perillo (Figma Capital):** Introduced a thesis on financializing social
  activity, particularly via **Pump.fun**.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **The Genius Act:** The recent passage of the U.S. stablecoin legislation provides
  the "rules of the road," which is crucial for enabling traditional corporate partnerships
  and driving the onshore adoption of compliant stablecoins like USAT.

  *   **Geopolitical Impact:** Blockchains like Plasma facilitate the circumvention
  of capital controls, enabling citizens in high-inflation countries to dollarize
  savings and access global yields, accelerating global dollarization trends.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward a bifurcated stablecoin market: Tether/Plasma dominating
  offshore/global distribution, while USAT competes with Circle/USDC for onshore U.S.
  enterprise settlement (especially for 24/7 security token trading). Furthermore,
  the focus on revenue signals a necessary maturation phase where protocols must demonstrate
  tangible economic value capture for token holders, not just asset lockup.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Investors, DeFi Strategists, Blockchain
  Developers, and Financial Analysts** focused on infrastructure, stablecoin economics,
  and token valuation methodologies.'
