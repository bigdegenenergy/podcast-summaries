  text: There are two huge transformations of wealth. One is Gen Y, right? So basically,
    younger generations amassing roughly $120 trillion of assets over the next 25
    years. And the other part is on the back end. So one part is on the front end,
    where platforms like eToro have younger generations amassing wealth. And the other
    part is from a technology point of view, all of those assets are moving on-chain
    over time.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: #1580 Yoni Assia | Why Bitcoin Still Has 10x Upside


  This episode features Yoni Assia, Founder and CEO of the publicly traded trading
  platform eToro, in conversation with Anthony Pompliano (Pomp). The discussion centers
  on Assia''s long-term conviction in Bitcoin, the transformative potential of asset
  tokenization, eToro''s expansion in the US market amidst regulatory shifts, and
  the broader evolution of capital markets driven by retail investors and digital
  technology.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus areas are **Cryptocurrency Investment Thesis (specifically Bitcoin)**,
  **Financial Technology (FinTech) & Trading Platforms (eToro)**, and the **Tokenization
  of Real-World Assets (RWA)**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Colored Coins Precursor to Ethereum:** Assia highlighted that eToro pioneered
  the concept of "colored coins" on the Bitcoin network in 2012, which served as an
  early inspiration for Vitalik Buterin regarding tokenization and the eventual creation
  of Ethereum.

  *   **Stablecoins as Proof of Concept:** Stablecoins are identified as having the
  second-best product-market fit in crypto (after Bitcoin), demonstrating the efficiency
  of tokenized fiat for 24/7 asset transfer without traditional banking rails.

  *   **Tokenization Unlocking DeFi Primitives:** The tokenization of traditional
  assets (stocks, Treasuries) is expected to create a better, less counterparty-risky
  ledger, enabling the introduction of DeFi features like leverage, lending, and collateralization
  to traditional finance.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Bitcoin''s 10x Upside:** Assia maintains a strong conviction that Bitcoin
  is still early, viewing it as the **reserve currency of the digital economy**. He
  posits that its market capitalization could eventually surpass that of gold (currently
  ~$10+ trillion), implying a significant upside target (10x from current levels).

  *   **Tokenization of $100 Trillion in Assets:** The convergence of generational
  wealth transfer (Gen Y acquiring $120 trillion) and technological transition suggests
  that $100–$200 trillion worth of existing assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) will
  move on-chain over the next 25 years.

  *   **Retail Investor Dominance:** The rise of the self-directed, global retail
  investor is a major trend. Bitcoin is noted as the most widely distributed asset
  globally, and platforms like eToro serve as a gateway for these users to understand
  broader capital markets.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **eToro:** A $6 billion publicly traded company with 3.5 million users, aggressively
  scaling its US operations post-IPO.

  *   **Vitalik Buterin:** Mentioned for his early engagement with the colored coins
  concept, which influenced his thinking on blockchain utility beyond just currency.

  *   **Traditional Finance Giants (Fidelity, BlackRock, Goldman Sachs):** These firms
  are actively exploring or launching money market funds and other assets on the blockchain,
  validating the tokenization trend.

  *   **Donald Trump/Political Figures:** Noted for the surprising, sudden shift in
  the political narrative around crypto, evidenced by the presence of the crypto community
  at a recent DC event.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **US Regulatory Headwinds and Recovery:** eToro faced significant regulatory
  pressure in the US, leading them to delist most crypto assets except BTC and ETH
  (deemed commodities).

  *   **Improved Clarity Post-IPO:** Going public served as a trigger for eToro to
  aggressively scale its US crypto offering again, adding over 60 assets post-IPO
  and planning to reintroduce staking. Assia notes a perception of **better regulatory
  clarity** under the current political climate.

  *   **Historical Debanking:** Assia recounted a 2017 incident where major banks
  demanded eToro remove $100 million due to their crypto exposure, contrasting sharply
  with their current relationships with major global banks (J.P. Morgan, Goldman,
  Citi).


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward a convergence where tokenization simplifies access
  to complex assets (like an ETF wrapper for everything) and removes global trading
  barriers. Traditional finance innovation (like 24/5 futures trading) is borrowing
  efficiency from crypto/DeFi. The focus will shift from meme tokens back towards
  the tokenization of **Real-World Assets (RWA)**, which Assia believes will see mass
  adoption around 2025.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Investors, FinTech Professionals, Asset
  Managers, and Institutional Strategists** interested in the intersection of digital
  assets, regulatory evolution, and the future of retail investment platforms.'
