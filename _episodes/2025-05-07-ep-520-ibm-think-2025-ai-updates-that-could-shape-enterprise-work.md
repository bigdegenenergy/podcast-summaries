    the large language models that we use right now, we don't think of them as necessarily
    autonomous because we, the human, still for the most part have to go in and feed

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: EP 520: IBM Think 2025 - AI Updates that could
  shape Enterprise Work


  This 47-minute episode of the Everyday AI Show focuses on the significant generative
  AI announcements made at the IBM Think 2025 conference, specifically highlighting
  updates to the **Watsonx AI platform** designed to drive practical, agentic workflows
  within large enterprises. The host, Jordan Wilson, contrasts consumer-facing AI
  (like ChatGPT) with the robust, data-integrated solutions necessary for enterprise
  operations.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **IBM Watsonx platform**, particularly advancements in
  **Watsonx Orchestrate** concerning **AI Agent creation and automation**. Key themes
  include the shift from simple LLM interaction to autonomous, workflow-executing
  agents, the importance of integrating proprietary enterprise data, and the growing
  viability of Small Language Models (SLMs).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Agentic Workflow Automation:** Watsonx Orchestrate is evolving to create "doers"—autonomous
  AI agents that orchestrate complex workflows across disparate enterprise systems
  (like Salesforce, Oracle) using low-code/no-code interfaces.

  *   **Rapid Agent Customization:** New "build-your-own agent" capabilities allow
  non-technical users to create customized, data-connected agents in under five minutes,
  leveraging a drag-and-drop interface and immediate preview/reasoning model visualization.

  *   **SLM Validation:** IBM continues to be bullish on Small Language Models (SLMs),
  noting that modern SLMs (like Llama 4, Gemma 3) are now competitive (Tier 1B) for
  many business tasks, offering a flexible alternative to massive foundational models.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Enterprise Data Integration is Key:** Watsonx’s core value proposition remains
  its ability to securely connect to and operate on dynamic, up-to-date enterprise
  data sources, overcoming the limitations of consumer tools.

  *   **Pre-built Domain Agents Drive ROI:** The introduction of pre-built, fine-tuned
  domain agents (e.g., HR, Sales, Procurement) offers immediate, high-impact automation.
  The Better Business Bureau reported **$1.5 million in annual cost savings** from
  implementing these agents.

  *   **Democratization of Development:** The five-minute, no-code agent builder significantly
  lowers the barrier to entry for AI implementation, allowing business leaders (not
  just developers) to deploy solutions quickly, accelerating enterprise adoption timelines.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **IBM:** The central focus, highlighting CEO **Arvind Krishna**''s emphasis
  on SLMs and the strategic direction of the Watsonx suite.

  *   **Amazon (AWS):** Mentioned for its reported development of **Kiro**, a highly
  advanced, multi-modal AI code generation tool expected in 2025, signaling intense
  competition in the AI coding assistant space.

  *   **Google:** Noted for the release of the **Gemini 2.5 Pro I/O edition**, which
  now leads the web development leaderboard benchmarks, surpassing OpenAI models in
  specific coding metrics.

  *   **OpenAI/Windsurf:** Windsurf, a coding AI startup, was reportedly acquired
  by OpenAI for $3 billion, underscoring the high valuation in the AI tooling sector.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the enterprise AI landscape is rapidly shifting from simple
  querying to **agentic execution**. The future of enterprise work will involve non-technical
  staff building and deploying specialized AI agents that autonomously manage complex,
  multi-step business processes by integrating across existing software stacks. Furthermore,
  the platform flexibility (supporting Granite, Llama, Mistral, Gemma) indicates a
  future where enterprises will utilize a diverse portfolio of models optimized for
  specific tasks rather than relying on a single monolithic LLM.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Enterprise Technology Leaders (CTOs, CIOs),
  Business Unit Heads (HR, Sales VPs), AI Strategists, and IT Professionals** working
  within large organizations that utilize or are evaluating IBM infrastructure. It
  is targeted at professionals needing to understand the practical, deployable applications
  of generative AI beyond consumer chatbots.'
