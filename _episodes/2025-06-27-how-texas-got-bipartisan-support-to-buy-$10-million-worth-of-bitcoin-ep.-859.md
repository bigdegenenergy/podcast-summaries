summary: '## Podcast Summary: How Texas Got Bipartisan Support to Buy $10 Million
  Worth of Bitcoin - Ep. 859


  This episode of Unchained features Lee Bratcher, President and Founder of the Texas
  Blockchain Council, discussing the successful legislative effort in Texas to establish
  a **strategic Bitcoin reserve** for the state, backed by a **\$10 million appropriation**.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Public Sector Adoption of Bitcoin**, specifically the
  legislative and political journey to secure state-level approval for purchasing
  and holding Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Secondary themes include the political
  dynamics of crypto legislation at the state level and the importance of property
  rights in driving early academic interest in blockchain technology.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Custody Requirements:** The legislation mandates that the Comptroller must
  hold the Bitcoin asset directly, not just gain exposure via ETFs. Acceptable custody
  methods include using a qualified custodian, multi-institutional custody, or multi-signature
  solutions, emphasizing the state''s intent to learn about key management.

  *   **Exchange Requirements:** The chosen liquidity provider (exchange) must have
  been in business for five or more years and maintain a principal office in Texas,
  aiming to ensure stability and local commitment.

  *   **Derivatives Latitude:** Language allowing the Comptroller to use derivatives
  is included primarily to ensure compliance with "prudent investor standards" and
  provide maximum latitude, rather than indicating an intent to use derivatives for
  the reserve itself.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Conservative Allocation:** The \$10 million allocation is considered highly
  conservative, representing only 0.0004% of Texas’s \$250 billion annual budget,
  making it a meaningful pilot for technology adoption while being financially negligible
  in case of loss.

  *   **Long-Term Strategy:** The reserve is explicitly intended as a "long-term strategy
  by and hold," signaling a commitment to the asset class rather than short-term trading.

  *   **Pension Fund Precedent:** The discussion noted that some public entities,
  like the Fairfax County pension fund outside D.C., have already successfully allocated
  to Bitcoin, setting a precedent for state-level treasury management.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Lee Bratcher (Guest):** Founder of the Texas Blockchain Council, instrumental
  in lobbying and conceptualizing the reserve.

  *   **Chairman Giovanni Capriclione:** Key legislative champion in the Texas House,
  leading the Digital Assets committee.

  *   **Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick & Governor Greg Abbott:** High-level state
  officials who supported the bill, creating strong tailwinds.

  *   **Custody Bidders:** Major industry players vying for the custody contract include
  Coinbase, Anchorage, Kraken, Blockchain.com, and Unchained Capital.

  *   **Hernando de Soto:** Economist whose work on property rights in the developing
  world heavily influenced Bratcher''s academic interest in blockchain for land administration.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Bipartisan Support:** The bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support
  (26 of 31 Senators, 103 of 150 House members), demonstrating that digital asset
  policy can transcend partisan divides, especially when driven by education and local
  economic interests.

  *   **Age Correlation:** Political support correlated strongly with age demographics:
  about half of Texans under 30 own digital assets, while only 6% of those over 70
  do. This younger, digitally native base influences both parties.

  *   **State-Level Momentum:** Texas joins New Hampshire (which passed legislation
  but lacks an appropriation) in advancing state-level Bitcoin initiatives, with 26
  other states having proposed similar legislation. Arizona''s initial reserve bill
  was vetoed by the Governor.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The Texas move signals a growing trend of state-level experimentation with digital
  assets, driven by a desire to foster innovation and manage existing surpluses. Bratcher
  suggests that other states with budget surpluses (like North Carolina or Florida)
  are likely candidates for the next reserve, while states with significant deficits
  (like California or Illinois) face a much harder political sell. The conversation
  also touched on federal optimism, referencing Senator Lummis’s bill and the potential
  for federal "Bitcoin bonds."


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto/Web3 Professionals, Public Finance Officials,
  State Legislators, and Policy Analysts** interested in regulatory frameworks, institutional
  adoption, and the political economy of digital assets.'
