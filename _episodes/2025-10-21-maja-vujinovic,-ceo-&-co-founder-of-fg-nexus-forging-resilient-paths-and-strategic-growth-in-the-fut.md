summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Maja Vujinovic, CEO & Co-Founder of FG Nexus


  This 70-minute episode of *Searching for Mana* features host Lloyd Wohed interviewing
  Maja Vujinovic, CEO and Co-Founder of FG Nexus, focusing on the convergence of digital
  assets, institutional finance, and the transformative potential of AI. The discussion
  traces Vujinovic’s unique career path from building mobile payments in emerging
  markets to her foundational role in the early days of Tether, culminating in her
  current venture, FG Nexus.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Digital Asset Treasury Management**, specifically the
  strategic decision to build a treasury vehicle around **Ethereum (ETH)**, and the
  future implications of integrating **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** with blockchain
  infrastructure (Web3). The conversation bridges traditional finance, emerging market
  challenges, and cutting-edge decentralized technology.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **ERC-404 Standard as an AI Catalyst:** Vujinovic cited the Ethereum ERC-404
  standard as a pivotal moment in changing her perspective on AI. This standard enables
  the description of **trustless, on-chain AI agents** capable of holding assets,
  interacting with DeFi, and signing transactions based on programmable logic.

  *   **AI''s Need for Faster Infrastructure:** The discussion highlighted that AI,
  particularly for complex tasks like predictive analytics and high-frequency trading,
  cannot be sustained by legacy infrastructure and requires the speed and programmability
  offered by blockchain technology.

  *   **Tokenization and Decentralized Science (DeSci):** DeSci was presented as a
  powerful, though not yet scaled, use case where tokenization allows communities
  to fund scientific research that might otherwise lack traditional traction, democratizing
  access globally.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **FG Nexus Strategy:** FG Nexus is positioned as a digital asset treasury vehicle,
  similar to MicroStrategy, which successfully raised **$200 million** in two months.
  Their strategy is entirely focused on acquiring and **staking Ethereum (ETH)**,
  aiming for a **$5 billion AUM**.

  *   **ETH vs. BTC/Other Chains:** The choice of ETH over Bitcoin or other chains
  was deliberate, driven by the belief that Ethereum’s programmability and smart contract
  capabilities are essential for the next wave of institutional adoption, particularly
  in tokenization and agent-based systems.

  *   **Institutional Validation:** The successful fundraising, attracting investors
  like Citadel and .72, signals growing institutional appetite for structured digital
  asset exposure, albeit focused on specific, programmable assets like ETH.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Maja Vujinovic:** Highlighted her background in mobile payments (Africa/Latin
  America), energy project finance, and her early involvement in **Tether**, where
  she helped secure their first banking partner.

  *   **GE (General Electric):** Vujinovic shared experiences deploying early smart
  contracts using GE’s real data sets, noting resistance from management when proposing
  ideas like using GE electricity to mine Bitcoin.

  *   **JP Morgan:** Mentioned their involvement in the first trade finance deal executed
  on a blockchain between JP Morgan and GE, which served as a key conviction point
  for Vujinovic regarding blockchain''s viability.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  While direct regulatory deep-dives were limited, the conversation touched upon the
  importance of **sovereign identity** and immutable records, referencing Vujinovic’s
  personal experience as a refugee whose identity was tied to a state that ceased
  to exist. This underscores the need for decentralized, auditable identity solutions.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is entering a phase where **investment and
  finance** will lead blockchain adoption, moving beyond the initial hype cycles.
  The next 2-3 years are predicted to see increased integration of AI agents with
  DeFi, particularly in high-frequency trading. Long-term (15-30 years), AI is expected
  to cause a "true labor market transformation," though Vujinovic leans toward humans
  **evolving with AI** rather than mass replacement in the near term.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Finance Professionals, Institutional Investors,
  Web3 Strategists, and Technology Executives** interested in the intersection of
  decentralized finance, corporate treasury strategy, and the practical application
  of AI within blockchain ecosystems.'
