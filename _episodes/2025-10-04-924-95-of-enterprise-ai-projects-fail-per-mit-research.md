summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - The MIT NANDA report claims 95% of enterprise AI projects fail to achieve measurable
    business impact.
  - Only 5% of AI pilots successfully reach production at scale because current models
    are static, lack context retention, and do not adapt to feedback.
  - A 'shadow AI economy' exists, where employees use personal AI tools (like ChatGPT)
    effectively, showing high demand but dissatisfaction with sanctioned corporate
    solutions.
  - Successful AI projects (the 5%) utilize agentic systems that learn, remember,
    adapt, and integrate tightly into existing workflows.
  - Winning strategies involve starting small on critical tasks and scaling successful
    proofs-of-concept incrementally.
  - The core issue is not AI itself, but the failure of organizations to deploy adaptive,
    integrated systems correctly.
  overview: An MIT NANDA report suggests that a staggering 95% of enterprise AI projects
    fail to deliver measurable business impact, primarily because the deployed models
    are static and fail to integrate adaptively into workflows. This failure contrasts
    sharply with the high adoption of 'shadow AI' by employees, indicating a strong
    demand for functional tools that can learn and evolve with the business. Success,
    found in the remaining 5%, hinges on deploying agentic, learning systems that
    are tightly integrated into daily processes.
