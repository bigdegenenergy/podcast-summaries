    He then goes to the influencer and then goes, 'Okay, here's what you're going
    to get paid out.' And so it's usually four to five steps before it gets from the

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: MAJOR ALTCOINS THAT WILL GO TO ZERO🚨 (Founder
  of Web3 Gaming Explains)


  This 64-minute episode features an in-depth discussion with **Timothy Tello**, CEO
  of Ethics and self-proclaimed "grandfather of Web3 gaming," focusing on the failures
  of current Web3 gaming models and the necessary evolution toward seamless, integrated
  gaming economies.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **Web3 Gaming Industry**, specifically critiquing
  current speculative models (NFT gatekeeping, volatile tokens) and outlining a path
  toward successful, scalable gaming that integrates blockchain technology subtly.
  Secondary themes include digital identity, cybersecurity, and the economic structure
  of the broader gaming industry (mobile vs. AAA).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **The Two-Token Model for Stability:** Successful Web3 gaming requires separating
  the volatile, speculative external token (for secondary markets/cashing out) from
  the stable, in-game currency (like V-Bucks) which maintains a fixed value. This
  prevents player frustration when in-game asset values fluctuate.

  *   **Blockchain for Revenue Waterfall Auditing:** The core technical innovation
  Tello patented involves using blockchain to create transparent, auditable smart
  contracts for revenue sharing among developers, artists, and operators within a
  shared game ecosystem, solving a problem that plagued early attempts like MapleStory.

  *   **Custodial Wallets are Necessary for Mass Adoption:** Publishers will not adopt
  non-custodial wallets due to control and cost. The successful model must utilize
  **custodial wallets** that abstract away the complexity of blockchain interaction
  for the average gamer.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Web3 Gaming (As Currently Known) is Dead:** The speculative, NFT-gated version
  of Web3 gaming has failed. Success lies in integrating blockchain features so deeply
  that the "Web3" label disappears, becoming simply "gaming."

  *   **Focus on Economies of Scale (The Roblox Model):** The future is not competing
  with $200M+ AAA titles but replicating the success of platforms like Roblox, which
  achieved massive LTV ($300 vs. $3 average) and retention through a single, universally
  accepted token/currency across thousands of experiences.

  *   **Mobile Dominance:** The focus should be on the mobile market (77% of volume/revenue)
  rather than trying to launch the next PC blockbuster, as mobile offers lower barriers
  to entry for new, community-driven models.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Timothy Tello:** The guest, holding the patent for obligatory video games
  utilizing blockchain, arguing for a community-centric approach over self-interest.

  *   **Axie Infinity & Gala Games:** Cited as examples of failed models—essentially
  "staking protocols with an animation" rather than true games.

  *   **Roblox:** Held up as the gold standard for achieving massive economies of
  scale and player retention through a unified economic structure.

  *   **Epic Games/Unreal Engine:** Mentioned in context of early free-to-play adoption
  skepticism and the development of Fortnite (originally "Gunslingers").

  *   **Activision/Rockstar:** Acknowledged as the giants whose massive development
  costs (e.g., GTA 6) make them resistant to disruption unless they adopt auditability/tokenization
  for internal economy control.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched upon the restrictive nature of **Apple and Google''s App
  Store policies** (30% processing fees and privacy changes) which have hampered monetization,
  leading to job losses in the industry. Tello’s patented model was specifically designed
  to gain SEC approval by ensuring clear revenue waterfall auditing, suggesting a
  path for regulatory compliance.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward **consolidation and interoperability**, mirroring
  historical economic shifts like the adoption of credit cards or the Euro. Successful
  gaming ecosystems will function like unified gift card systems (Roblox/EA Sports),
  where a single token grants access and value across multiple titles, drastically
  improving player retention and LTV. The next wave of disruption will likely come
  from developer **co-ops** (e.g., in Southeast Asia) using shared tokens to compete
  against monolithic publishers.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Web3/Crypto Investors, Game Developers, Gaming
  Industry Executives, and Blockchain Architects** seeking a pragmatic, non-speculative
  roadmap for integrating blockchain technology into mainstream gaming.'
