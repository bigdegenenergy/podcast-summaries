  topic: strategy/politics

    that survived purely due to zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP) capital, rather than
    fundamental viability.

  text: Are you actually kind of a like a ZIRP phenomenon? And we saw this in tech.
    That's the only reason why I think it came up, right? Is there was a bunch of

    weren't good companies. There wasn't true demand for their product.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #1533 Jordi Visser | Why Bitcoin Will Hit An
  ATH This Year


  This 45-minute episode of the Pom Podcast features Anthony Pompliano interviewing
  macro analyst Jordy Visser to discuss current market dynamics, the future of American
  exceptionalism, the role of technology (AI/Robotics), and his bullish outlook for
  Bitcoin.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centered on **Macroeconomics and Finance**, specifically analyzing
  the structural changes in the US economy, global debt levels, the impact of geopolitical
  shifts (like tariffs), the role of technological innovation (AI and robotics), and
  the resulting implications for traditional asset classes and the cryptocurrency
  market, with a strong emphasis on **Bitcoin**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Liquidity Evaporation:** A critical, immediate concern is the rapid evaporation
  of liquidity across global markets, affecting everything from junk bonds to leveraged
  loans, suggesting an imminent need for intervention to prevent a rapid economic
  freeze or depression.

  *   **AI & Embodiment Focus:** While the Mag 7 stocks are viewed with skepticism
  due to valuation, the true innovation growth area lies in the "embodiment side"—specifically
  memory components (Micron, SK Hynix) necessary for robotics and AI hardware, which
  are less dependent on immediate US/China trade negotiations than large chip designers.

  *   **Bitcoin as the Decentralized Solution:** Bitcoin is positioned as the necessary
  solution to the weaponization of the US Dollar as the global reserve currency and
  the inherent risks of a centralized capital stack, offering a decentralized, trust-minimized
  alternative.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Bitcoin ATH Prediction:** Visser is highly confident that **Bitcoin will reach
  a new All-Time High (ATH) this year**, driven by either a resolution (pause/deal)
  on US/China tariffs or the necessity for the government to inject liquidity to stabilize
  freezing markets.

  *   **Barbell Strategy Recommended:** Investors should adopt a barbell strategy:
  focusing on **"tortoise"** plays (resilient, slow-growth sectors like healthcare
  providers benefiting from AI efficiency, e.g., McKesson, Cardinal Health) and **"hare"**
  plays (fast innovation stories like memory/robotics components).

  *   **Energy Sector Discount:** Energy stocks are currently undervalued relative
  to their necessity for the ongoing AI buildout; increased power demand suggests
  they will be a significant play in the second half of the year.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordy Visser:** Macro analyst providing the core market thesis.

  *   **Russell Napier:** Mentioned for his analysis on the rise of "national capitalism"
  and the breakdown of global borders.

  *   **Scott Besson:** Referenced for comments suggesting the US Treasury is stepping
  in with liquidity tools, potentially challenging the Fed''s control.

  *   **Micron & SK Hynix:** Highlighted as key investments in the memory sector crucial
  for robotics.

  *   **Bitwise:** Mentioned as a sponsor, noted for transparency (publishing wallet
  addresses) and supporting Bitcoin open-source development.

  *   **FigureMarkets:** Mentioned as a sponsor offering Bitcoin/Ethereum-backed loans.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The conversation heavily touched on policy implications:

  *   **Tariffs:** New tariffs on China are seen as a short-term headwind, particularly
  slowing down the development of humanoid robotics due to reliance on Chinese-sourced
  actuators.

  *   **Fiscal vs. Monetary Conflict:** There is a perceived conflict where the Executive
  branch (President/Treasury) is pressuring the Federal Reserve to ease policy, with
  the Treasury potentially using its own tools to inject liquidity if the Fed resists.
  Visser argues that a surprise Fed rate cut would paradoxically lead to *higher*
  long-term yields, suggesting the market should stop focusing on rate cuts as the
  primary catalyst.

  *   **Loss of Reserve Status:** Visser firmly believes the US has already lost its
  status as the undisputed global reserve currency due to its weaponization via sanctions,
  leading to a migration toward a multi-polar currency environment, which bolsters
  the case for Bitcoin.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a near-term future dominated by **liquidity intervention**
  (either by the Treasury or due to market freezing) and a longer-term shift toward
  a **decentralized digital economy** powered by AI and supported by Bitcoin. This
  technological abundance is framed as the only viable path to restore hope and affordability
  for younger generations facing high costs of living.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Investment Professionals, Macro Analysts, and Sophisticated Crypto Investors.**
  The discussion requires a foundational understanding of macro indicators (debt-to-GDP,
  yield curves, liquidity), Fed policy, and the structural arguments for Bitcoin adoption.'
