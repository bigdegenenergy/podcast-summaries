summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: $110,000 BITCOIN By Friday?! This Chart Says
  GO! (XRP BUYING CIRCLE?)


  This 61-minute episode of *Discover Crypto* hosted by DZ, featuring guest TJ, focused
  heavily on immediate Bitcoin price action predictions, technical analysis supporting
  bullish targets, and significant developments within the broader altcoin and DeFi
  sectors, particularly highlighting XRP.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**: Cryptocurrency market analysis, focusing on Bitcoin technical
  charting, DeFi sector performance (specifically Aave and Curve), and major news
  regarding XRP.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Bitcoin Fractal Analysis**: The hosts detailed a fractal pattern suggesting
  that Bitcoin''s current range ($100K–$106K) mirrors a previous setup ($92K–$96K)
  that preceded a significant upward move (a 10% pump leading to $114K).

  *   **Bearish Divergence Warning**: Despite bullish fractal signals, the daily timeframe
  showed a bearish divergence on the RSI, indicating fading buying momentum, which
  suggests a potential "right shoulder" formation or a pullback toward the $102K level
  if resistance fails.

  *   **Short Squeeze Potential**: A significant amount of short selling ($20.3 billion
  in liquidations on Binance near $107K) was identified, suggesting that a push past
  recent highs could trigger a rapid "teleport god candle" due to forced liquidations.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Aggressive Bullish Targets**: Multiple analysts (including "Fork" and extensions
  mentioned by the hosts) are targeting $110K to $115K for Bitcoin in the very near
  term (potentially by the Bitcoin Conference next week or late May/early June).

  *   **DeFi Blue Chips Outperforming**: The recent surge in DeFi tokens like Aave
  (up 17%) and Curve validated the hosts'' prior recommendations, solidifying them
  as "blue chips" within the maturing DeFi niche.

  *   **Altcoin Rotation**: The hosts noted that as Bitcoin consolidates, the altcoin
  market is heating up, with specific trades being shared in their private Discord
  group (e.g., a profitable Pepe long).


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **BlackRock**: Mentioned as rapidly accumulating Bitcoin, now second only to
  Satoshi''s wallet, with projections suggesting they could pass Satoshi by next summer,
  fueling institutional adoption narratives.

  *   **XRP**: The primary news driver mentioned in the title, suggesting a potential
  "buying circle" or major accumulation effort, possibly related to acquiring the
  world''s second-largest stablecoin (though details were sparse).

  *   **Peter Schiff**: Highlighted as the primary short seller who stands to be "wrecked"
  if Bitcoin pumps past $107K.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   The discussion touched briefly on the US government''s goal to accumulate a
  million Bitcoin, framed within the context of institutional competition (BlackRock,
  Fidelity) for BTC holdings.

  *   The hosts strongly advocated for **self-custody** (mentioning Arculus hardware
  wallets) as a necessary defense against institutional accumulation by entities like
  BlackRock.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  The conversation strongly suggests an imminent, rapid upward move for Bitcoin driven
  by technical setups and short liquidations, likely hitting new all-time highs within
  the next few weeks, coinciding with the Bitcoin Conference. The DeFi sector is confirmed
  as a strong, maturing investment niche.


  **7. Target Audience**: Experienced cryptocurrency traders and investors familiar
  with technical analysis (fractals, RSI divergence, liquidation heatmaps) and those
  actively tracking institutional flows (ETFs, BlackRock).

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast episode provided an intense, short-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin,
  driven by technical chart patterns and market structure, while also covering significant
  movements in the DeFi space and major institutional accumulation.


  The main narrative arc centered on the question of whether Bitcoin could reach **$110,000
  by Friday**, a highly optimistic target that the hosts explored through **fractal
  analysis**. They identified a repeating pattern between the current consolidation
  range ($100K–$106K) and a prior successful range ($92K–$96K) that historically led
  to a 10% pump, projecting a target near $114K. This bullish projection is further
  supported by massive **short seller liquidations** ($20B+ on Binance near $107K),
  suggesting that breaching recent highs could trigger a swift, explosive move.


  However, the hosts injected necessary caution by pointing out a **daily bearish
  divergence** on the RSI, which suggests momentum is fading and could lead to a temporary
  pullback toward $102K if the pattern forms a "right shoulder."


  Beyond Bitcoin, the episode celebrated the performance of **DeFi tokens**, specifically
  Aave and Curve, which validated the hosts'' recent video recommendations. They emphasized
  that DeFi has matured enough to easily identify reliable "blue chip" investments
  within the niche. The hosts also shared actionable trade ideas in their Discord,
  including a successful Pepe long.


  A significant portion of the discussion focused on **institutional adoption**, noting
  that BlackRock is accumulating BTC at an unprecedented pace, potentially surpassing
  Satoshi Nakamoto’s holdings within a year. This accumulation, coupled with record
  daily ETF inflows, underscores strong Wall Street conviction. In contrast, the hosts
  strongly advised listeners to maintain **self-custody** (promoting Arculus hardware
  wallets) rather than selling their holdings to these large custodians.


  Finally, the episode briefly touched upon **XRP news**, hinting at a major development
  possibly involving the acquisition of a major stablecoin, though this topic was
  left largely unresolved'
