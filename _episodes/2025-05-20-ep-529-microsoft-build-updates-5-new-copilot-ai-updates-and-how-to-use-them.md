summary: '## Podcast Summary: EP 529: Microsoft Build Updates: 5 new Copilot AI updates
  and how to use them


  This episode of the Everyday AI Show, hosted by Jordan Wilson, provides a focused
  breakdown of the most impactful AI updates announced at the Microsoft Build 2025
  conference, specifically highlighting five key advancements related to Microsoft
  Copilot that business leaders should understand. The host filters through the massive
  volume of announcements (an 80-page book of news) to deliver actionable insights
  on how these new tools can transform business operations.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Enterprise AI and Agentic Workflows** stemming from Microsoft
  Build 2025. The discussion centers on five major updates to the **Copilot ecosystem**,
  emphasizing the shift from simple assistants to autonomous, multi-agent systems
  capable of complex, cross-application tasks.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **GitHub Copilot as an Autonomous Agent:** GitHub Copilot has evolved beyond
  a coding assistant to an autonomous coding partner embedded in VS Code, capable
  of iterative refinement, testing, and accepting multimodal inputs like screenshots/mockups.
  It now supports the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** popularized by Anthropic.

  *   **Agent Foundry and Interoperability:** The generally available Azure AI Agent
  Foundry allows users to design and scale enterprise agents using thousands of models
  (including Grok 3, Llama, and GPT models). Crucially, it supports both Google’s
  **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol** and Anthropic’s **MCP**, enabling agents across
  different platforms to communicate.

  *   **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Copilot Studio now natively supports multi-agent
  orchestration, allowing specialized agents to discover, negotiate, and collaborate
  on tasks securely, leveraging agentic memory and automated validation tools.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Copilot Tuning for Customization:** The introduction of low-code **Copilot
  Tuning** allows organizations to fine-tune the core Copilot model using internal
  data and workflows (e.g., brand voice, output structure) without needing data science
  expertise, operating securely within the M365 boundary.

  *   **High Barrier to Entry for Tuning:** Currently, Copilot Tuning is restricted
  to large enterprises (requiring 5,000 Copilot licenses or an account team contact),
  which the host views as a potential misstep, limiting adoption by agile mid-market
  companies.

  *   **Automation Potential via Computer Use:** The "Computer Use in Copilot" feature
  promises significant ROI by automating highly repetitive, mundane desktop tasks
  like data entry, invoice processing, and cross-application navigation, acting like
  a human user via natural language prompts.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Microsoft:** The central entity, driving these updates across GitHub, Azure,
  and M365 Copilot.

  *   **Anthropic:** Mentioned for popularizing the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**,
  which is now being adopted widely.

  *   **Google:** Mentioned for its **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol**, which Microsoft
  is now supporting for interoperability.

  *   **Elon Musk (xAI):** Mentioned in the context of Grok models being available
  within the Agent Foundry.

  *   **Jordan Wilson (Host):** Positioned as an expert consultant helping companies
  navigate Gen AI strategy and ROI, referencing partnerships with Adobe, Nvidia, and
  others.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is rapidly moving toward **agentic computing**, where specialized AI
  agents collaborate autonomously to execute complex business processes. Interoperability
  standards like MCP and A2A are becoming critical infrastructure, allowing agents
  to communicate across vendor ecosystems. The future of work involves automating
  entire workflows rather than just single tasks, though the host cautions that multi-agent
  environments require extreme care regarding governance and alignment to prevent
  compounding errors.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Enterprise IT Leaders, AI Strategists, Software
  Developers, and Business Leaders** who use or plan to implement Microsoft 365 Copilot.
  It provides a curated, professional summary of complex technical releases, focusing
  on practical application and strategic implications.

  ### Comprehensive Narrative Summary


  The podcast episode serves as a vital digest of Microsoft Build 2025, focusing exclusively
  on five (plus a bonus sixth) transformative updates to the Copilot ecosystem designed
  to elevate AI from a productivity tool to an autonomous business partner.


  The narrative begins by establishing the overwhelming volume of announcements and
  immediately pivots to the host''s curated list of the most important changes. **Update
  1** details the evolution of **GitHub Copilot** into an autonomous coding agent
  that accepts multimodal inputs and supports the MCP standard, positioning it as
  a full programming suite rather than just an assistant.


  **Update 2, Copilot Tuning**, is presented as a potential game-changer for enterprise
  differentiation. This low-code feature allows organizations to fine-tune the base
  Copilot model using proprietary data for specific tasks, tone, and structure, all
  while ensuring data security (Microsoft confirms customer data is not used for foundation
  model training). However, the host critiques the high entry barrier (5,000 licenses),
  suggesting it favors slow-moving giants over agile mid-market firms.


  The discussion then moves into the realm of **Agentic AI**. **Update 3, Agent Foundry**,
  is an Azure-powered playground for building, deploying, and scaling enterprise agents,
  supporting thousands of models. Its significance lies in its adoption of both Google’s
  A2A and Anthropic’s MCP protocols, signaling a necessary move toward open standards
  for agent communication.


  This leads directly into **Update 4, Multi-Agent Orchestration in Copilot Studio**.
  This feature allows multiple specialized agents to'
