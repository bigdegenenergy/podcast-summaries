    the leading centralized exchanges, they want to put them effectively in jail,
    right? And they said, okay, our backs are against the wall, we're going to go
    all in and we're going to go all in because the elections will determine whether
    or not we can do crypto in the United States.

  text: What they're doing is putting on-chain first, the Treasury's market. But they're
    going to keep adding, adding securities and other real-world assets on-chain.
    And to give adoption to giving access to the world to US regulated markets is
    quite an undertaking, but something very interested, very interested in embracing.
  topic: DeFi/Tokenization

    the underlying infrastructure (''the pipes'') rather than just wrapping existing
    assets.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What's interesting to me, maybe about kind of their philosophy or their approach,
    I've seen a lot of these tokenization platforms and many of them are focused on
    the asset themselves. There's some version of, I'm going to take a stock, a Treasury
    or whatever, put a wrapper around it, and then I can just go put it onto these
    blockchains. But to me, it feels like Ondo is much more focused on the infrastructure
    itself. They want to kind of rebuild the pipes on which these assets will sit.
  topic: Technology/Tokenization
- impact_reason: Argues that true innovation in tokenization requires a 'soup to nuts'
    crypto-native infrastructure build to achieve meaningful cost advantages over
    legacy finance.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But without being crypto-native, it's very hard. All you're doing is really
    adding a new expense to what is like Washington's doing. Like New York is doing
    pretty well, right? The world finance, Wall Street is doing pretty well. So you've
    got to go soup to nuts with a crypto plumbing and pipes in order to build this
    infrastructure out in order to get a real cost advantage and to actually have
    global markets on this platform.
  topic: Technology/DeFi

    catalyst, forcing legacy finance to innovate and improve user experience through
    direct competition.

  text: Obviously the market's going to be 24/7 at some point in the future. And so
    is crypto kind of like the Trojan horse? Do we need these new technologies to
    come in and kind of salt Wall Street and say, look, we're actually going to compete.
    By competing, that's going to lead to the innovation, the innovation leads to
    the better experience for the user, right? That's basically what it is. You have
    to have innovators innovate and drag the rest of the industry into it.

    (a software update) rather than revolutionary (a mindset shift), focusing on efficiency
    gains.

  text: I think this is the bleeding edge of crypto adoption. I think this requires
    not a mindset shift for Wall Street and Wall Street traders or the global demand
    for the US dollar, but playing on that. This is a faster, better, cheaper way
    to trade.

    there's no enforcement. If you think about some of these rules, it is very clear

summary: '## Podcast Summary: #1563 Patrick McHenry | Washington Is Finally Embracing
  Bitcoin?!


  This episode of the Pomp Podcast features an in-depth conversation with **Patrick
  McHenry**, former Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and current
  Vice Chair at ONDO, focusing on the dramatic shift in Washington D.C.''s stance
  toward Bitcoin and digital assets, the legislative path forward, and the future
  of tokenization.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **maturation of the cryptocurrency industry** as it
  integrates with traditional finance (TradFi) and the necessary **regulatory clarity**
  required in the U.S. Key topics include the impact of the Bitcoin ETFs, the political
  dynamics driving regulatory change, the status of stablecoin and market structure
  legislation (FIT 21), and the transformative potential of **tokenization** of real-world
  assets (RWAs).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Blockchain for Forensics:** Open, permissionless blockchains are highly transparent,
  making them excellent tools for law enforcement (FBI, CIA) to track illicit finance,
  contrary to the common misconception that they are ideal for money laundering.

  *   **Tokenization as a Software Update:** The adoption of tokenizing major markets
  like U.S. Treasuries and securities is viewed not as a massive mindset shift for
  Wall Street, but as a **"software update"**—a faster, cheaper, and better way to
  trade existing assets.

  *   **Crypto and AI Identity:** Cryptographic identity solutions inherent in crypto
  are positioned as the necessary answer to the growing societal challenge of **proof
  of human/identity verification** in the age of advanced Artificial Intelligence.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Institutional Entry:** The approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the shift in regulatory
  sentiment have allowed highly regulated financial institutions to finally enter
  the crypto waters, moving beyond simulations to actual engagement.

  *   **Focus on Tokenization Leaders:** Companies like **Ondo** are highlighted as
  leading the first wave of crypto adoption among traditional finance players by bringing
  the U.S. Treasury market on-chain, offering regulated, 24/7 global access.

  *   **Risk of Regulatory Lag:** There is a significant risk that if Congress fails
  to pass clear legislation soon, the U.S. will lose its leadership position, forcing
  adoption and innovation overseas while American citizens are left behind.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Patrick McHenry:** Central figure providing insight from his tenure leading
  the House Financial Services Committee.

  *   **Gary Gensler (SEC Chair):** Mentioned as a prime example of how political
  shifts (elections) directly influence regulatory posture, moving from an "anti-crypto"
  stance to one aligned with the current administration''s priorities.

  *   **Ondo:** Highlighted as a key company bridging TradFi and crypto through the
  tokenization of Treasuries.

  *   **Larry Fink (BlackRock CEO):** Noted as a major proponent of the tokenization
  trend.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Election Consequences:** McHenry stresses that the current pro-digital asset
  environment stems directly from the **2020 election results**, which prioritized
  digital assets, leading to aligned appointees at agencies like the SEC and CFTC.

  *   **Legislative Bifurcation:** The separation of the **Stablecoin Bill** and the
  **Market Structure Bill (FIT 21)** was a deliberate political strategy to gain broader,
  bipartisan support for the simpler stablecoin framework first, while the market
  structure bill addresses the more complex CFTC/SEC jurisdiction fight.

  *   **Illicit Finance Critique:** The primary pushback against legislation revolves
  around concerns over illicit finance. McHenry counters this by explaining the transparency
  of public blockchains versus the opacity of cash transactions.

  *   **Need for Statutory Law:** The most critical immediate need is passing legislation
  to establish **statutory clarity** so that the industry''s presence in the U.S.
  is permanent, regardless of future political administrations.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is rapidly moving toward **deep embedding
  within the internet and finance within the next five years**, driven by regulatory
  clarity. The next decade will be defined by the tokenization of RWAs and the merging
  of crypto identity solutions with the challenges posed by AI. McHenry remains highly
  optimistic about the long-term benefits of decentralization, viewing current complex
  regulatory enforcement questions as "over the horizon thinking" that lawmakers are
  not yet equipped to solve.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Financial Professionals, Policy Analysts, Crypto
  Investors, and Executives** in the TradFi and Web3 sectors who need a high-level,
  politically informed perspective on the current state and near-term trajectory of
  U.S. digital asset regulation and institutional adoption.'
