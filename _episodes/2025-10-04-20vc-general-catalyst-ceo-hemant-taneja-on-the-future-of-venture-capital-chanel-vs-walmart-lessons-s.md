    we have done is, if you look at our overall assets under management, we've basically

summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - Venture capital cannot scale performance and size simultaneously; true iconic
    companies are not manufactured simply by having more money available.
  - General Catalyst maintains a core focus on seed investing with high rigor, believing
    the earliest relationship with founders is crucial, even while managing large
    AUM.
  - GC architects its capital structure by keeping venture funds focused on elite
    performance (targeting 4-5x returns) while using separate funds for later-stage
    or value-add capital needs.
  - The firm prioritizes long-term support for iconic companies, exemplified by investing
    in Stripe 14 times over 15 years and supporting Anduril through every round since
    seeding.
  - The most significant macro shift is the impending, under-discussed impact of AI
    on white-collar jobs, particularly in outsourced service sectors, requiring massive
    global reskilling.
  - 'AI adoption in enterprises is slow because it requires four simultaneous transformations:
    data readiness, custom model training, workforce restructuring, and CEO courage.'
  - Governments are largely unprepared for the labor disruption, often relying on
    the assumption that society will naturally slow down disruptive change, which
    Taneja believes is a dangerous fallacy.
  overview: General Catalyst CEO Hemant Taneja discusses the firm's commitment to
    early-stage venture despite scaling to $40B AUM, emphasizing that venture capital
    performance cannot scale proportionally with capital size. He stresses the need
    for VCs to innovate their founder proposition rather than just deploying more
    capital, and highlights the massive societal disruption coming from AI's impact
    on global labor markets.
  themes:

  - General Catalyst's Investment Philosophy (Seed Focus vs. Scale)
