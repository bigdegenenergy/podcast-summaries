    It explains the incentive for large distribution platforms (apps, companies) to
    issue their own stablecoin to capture economic value.

    they are going to want to have their own stablecoin. Because that is the easiest
    way for them to potentially own how economics are distributed.
  topic: adoption/business
- impact_reason: Predicts the inevitable user-experience-driven consolidation phase
    following the current fragmentation, highlighting the friction caused by too many
    distinct tokens.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Then I expect sometime in the future there will be what I would call a rebundling,
    which is that everyone realizes that there's actually kind of sucks to have all
    of these different tokens, even if they share liquidity. I don't want to have
    to think about what those different integrations should be, how I think about
    putting connecting to different APIs. I don't want to have to think about all
    of the tickers alone. That's just a bad user experience.
  topic: adoption/technology
- impact_reason: Argues that regulatory parity among issuers reduces the importance
    of counterparty trust (for US users), making yield/utility the primary differentiator.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The most interesting part of the Clarity Act and the new regulation is that...
    I would only use USDC or I would at least because I trusted the most... But now
    if these guys are all regulated the same, I don't really care about that too much
    as long as I'm in the states at least or I'm using one of these apps that I trust.
  topic: regulation/adoption
- impact_reason: 'A crucial warning: stablecoins are not truly fungible because they
    represent liabilities of different entities, meaning they *should* trade at a
    discount/premium based on perceived risk, challenging the commodity abstraction
    model.'

  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: This presents a strong argument for decentralized, non-sovereign
    assets (BTC/Gold) as the ultimate geopolitical hedge against centralized fiat
    risk, contrasting with stablecoins.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I almost feel like the answer to Murt's question is not like another currency,
    but frankly, we're like Bitcoin or gold, because there's no, like basically, like
    when you're looking like just from a geopolitical lens, like nobody's going to
    want to put their savings in like something related to that, that the Chinese
    government can, you know, influence, right?
  topic: investment/adoption

    marginal yield advantages.

  text: I think they see themselves as, you know, at some day competitive against
    Bridge and Stripe, not just competitive against, you know, what it Tether, right?
    I think that's where the North Star is.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: 'Quantifies the difference in business models: Circle is sharing
    the majority of its yield revenue (suggesting a focus on adoption/network effect
    over pure profit margin), contrasting sharply with Tether''s likely higher margin
    model.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Based on what I'm seeing, like my guess is that their gross revenue to net
    revenue, you know, margin ends up being only like 20%, right? Like they share
    80% plus of that yield, which is an entirely different model from, from Tether.
  topic: defi
- impact_reason: A strong warning about the difficulty of launching and bootstrapping
    a successful L1/payment chain, suggesting Circle may be underestimating the operational
    complexity and competitive hurdles.

    the amount of disease you're going to get by building your own chain. Like it
    is, it's way harder than you think it is, at least to win, right?
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: 'This is a critical strategic insight: blockchains must choose a
    lane (highly opinionated/purpose-built OR unopinionated/general-purpose). The
    middle ground (like Circle/Arc seems to be attempting) lacks a clear competitive
    advantage.'

summary: '## Podcast Summary: The Stablecoin Competition Is On. Who Will Be the Winners
  and Losers? - Ep. 920


  This 67-minute episode of Unchained, hosted by Laura Shin, features Rob Hattick
  (Dragonfly) and Murt Memtaz (Helios) discussing the rapidly evolving and intensifying
  competition among stablecoin issuers, catalyzed by anticipated US regulatory clarity
  (like the Clarity Act). The central theme is the shift from a few dominant stablecoins
  to a potential proliferation driven by application-layer incentives.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **Stablecoin Market Landscape**, analyzing the competitive
  dynamics between established players (Tether, Circle) and emerging ecosystem-specific
  stablecoins. Key sub-themes include the drive for applications to own economic distribution,
  the role of regulation, user experience (UX), and the potential for stablecoins
  to disrupt B2B cross-border payments and FX.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Abstraction of Tickers:** Sophisticated applications (like exchanges or wallets)
  are beginning to abstract away stablecoin tickers (e.g., showing everything as "USD")
  to treat them as fungible commodities, allowing them to swap underlying assets based
  on the best yield offered to the application.

  *   **Liquidity Management Challenge:** While abstracting tickers is technically
  feasible, managing the necessary liquidity pools for a long tail of 50+ non-fungible
  stablecoins (which should theoretically trade slightly off-peg due to differing
  collateral liabilities) presents significant cost and annoyance for intermediaries.

  *   **B2B Settlement Potential:** There is a significant, largely untapped opportunity
  for stablecoins to revolutionize B2B treasury management and merchant settlement
  globally, potentially eliminating the friction and costs associated with traditional
  fiat on/off-ramps.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Incentive Alignment:** Companies controlling distribution (applications/ecosystems)
  are incentivized to issue their own stablecoins to capture the economic yield and
  control distribution, leading to an "unbundling" phase.

  *   **Tether''s Moat:** Tether maintains a powerful brand recognition moat, especially
  in the Global South (peer-to-peer/remittance), where users default to "Tether" regardless
  of the underlying chain or technical superiority.

  *   **Circle''s Institutional Appeal:** Circle (USDC) is positioned better for institutional
  adoption due to its regulatory transparency, public company status, and perceived
  lower counterparty risk compared to Tether, which appeals to large conglomerates
  seeking verifiable audits.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Tether (USDT) & Circle (USDC):** The established leaders, whose competition
  is shifting based on user segment (Tether dominates retail/Global South; Circle
  targets institutions).

  *   **Application Layer Players (Phantom, Jupiter):** These entities are driving
  the ecosystem stablecoin trend by launching their own or integrating deeply with
  service providers to capture economic value.

  *   **Stablecoin Infrastructure Providers (Athena, Bridge):** Companies offering
  "stablecoin-as-a-service" white-labeling are enabling the proliferation of application-specific
  tokens.

  *   **Paolo Ardoino (Tether CEO):** Mentioned regarding Tether''s brand strength
  and its strategy of not sharing yield, relying instead on existing network effects.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The passage of the **Clarity Act (US stablecoin law)** is seen as the catalyst that
  legitimizes the market, leveling the playing field regarding trust for US-based
  sophisticated users. Regulation reduces the immediate need for users to choose based
  solely on issuer trust, shifting the focus to yield and UX.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is entering a phase of **stablecoin unbundling**, where many application-specific
  tokens will emerge. This is expected to be followed by a **rebundling** phase, likely
  resulting in either:

  1.  A few major, interchangeable stablecoins dominating liquidity (the optimal outcome).

  2.  A complex "clearinghouse" layer built on top of disparate tokens (the legacy
  outcome).

  The ultimate winner may depend on whether consumer apps abstract tickers away or
  maintain distinct branded tokens.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Investors, DeFi Strategists, Blockchain
  Developers, and Fintech Professionals** interested in the infrastructure layer,
  regulatory impact, and long-term competitive strategy within the digital asset space.'
