  - The token has experienced significant price appreciation, quadrupling since CZ

    necessitating the acquisition of BNB or USDT on that specific chain.

    DEXs like PancakeSwap or directly on AsterDex.com.
  - The Aster token is currently locked and cannot be withdrawn from the exchange
    until October 1st, which the host anticipates could lead to sell pressure around
    that date.

    significantly even during the recording of the guide.
