    I think one of the issues with crypto onboarding, I guess, is that you get a wallet

  text: We can't just cover the fee ourselves because somebody could deduce us through
    that, because it's pretty expensive. But 31 cents or something like that, had

    and then writes everything back to the L1, as L2s do.

    writing raw transactions on the L1 (like their previous product, Code), as data
    is obfuscated within the program state.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: In Flipkash, it's different. Because now all these transactions are happening
    on the raw L1, they're happening in the virtual machine, which is like a custom
    program... So you can't just go look at what's happening. And so that gives a
    good level of privacy to transactions.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Crypto''s Fastest Payments App, Only Possible
  On Solana | Ted Livingston


  This 53-minute episode features Ted Livingston, founder and CEO of the newly rebranded
  Solana payments application, **Flipkash** (formerly Code). The discussion centers
  on the evolution of their project, the technical breakthroughs required to achieve
  near-instantaneous digital cash transfers, and the strategic shift from using the
  Kin token to stablecoins (USDC).


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Web3 Payments Infrastructure**, specifically leveraging
  the **Solana blockchain** to create a user experience (UX) that mimics and improves
  upon physical cash. Key themes include digital cash emulation, seamless onboarding,
  self-custody, and overcoming the latency and fee issues inherent in traditional
  crypto transactions.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Solana as the Foundation:** The team migrated to Solana early (2020) because
  its speed and low cost were the only viable infrastructure for their vision of instant,
  global payments.

  *   **Custom Layer 2/Virtual Machine:** To achieve true cash-like latency (microseconds)
  and guarantee transactions even during L1 outages, Flipkash built a custom **Layer
  2 virtual machine** on top of Solana. This VM handles transaction queuing and guarantees
  settlement without relying on constant L1 interaction, while maintaining self-custody.

  *   **On-Chain Account Costs Mitigation:** As SOL price appreciation made standard
  Solana account rent fees (previously negligible) too high (around $0.31), the custom
  VM uses a structure akin to "compressed NFTs" for virtual accounts, keeping operational
  costs low while ensuring self-custody.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **The "Cash Replacement" Niche:** Flipkash aims to compete not just with other
  crypto apps, but with mainstream apps like Venmo and Cash App by solving the specific
  pain points of physical cash (needing change, ATM trips) while offering superior
  speed and zero domestic fees.

  *   **Stablecoin Utility:** The shift to USDC solves past user confusion regarding
  volatile tokens (like Kin) and leverages the global acceptance of major stablecoins
  for easier on-ramping and off-ramping.

  *   **Forced Onboarding Strategy:** To solve the "empty wallet" problem common in
  crypto onboarding, Flipkash requires users to purchase a localized minimum balance
  (e.g., $20), immediately providing them with usable USDC and demonstrating the app''s
  utility instantly.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Ted Livingston:** Founder/CEO, previously founded Kick Messenger; an early
  advocate and adopter of Solana infrastructure.

  *   **Flipkash (formerly Code):** The payments application being discussed, now
  focused on USDC and cash emulation.

  *   **Solana (Anatoly Yakovenko):** Mentioned as the critical infrastructure partner
  that made the speed requirements achievable.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  While not a deep dive, the discussion touches on **privacy and compliance**. The
  team noted that while their previous app (Code) used complex mixing layers for privacy,
  Flipkash’s transactions are obfuscated within the custom virtual machine, offering
  good privacy by default. However, they voluntarily implement compliance measures
  (unlike purely anonymous cash) because they recognize the societal need to prevent
  illicit use, drawing on Ted''s past experience with Kick.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the future of payments lies in abstracting away blockchain
  complexity entirely. Flipkash aims to deliver an experience so fast and seamless
  that users treat the underlying technology (Solana, USDC) as irrelevant infrastructure,
  focusing only on the utility of digital cash. The success of this model hinges on
  achieving mass adoption through superior UX that even traditional finance cannot
  match.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Developers, Blockchain Engineers, Product
  Managers in Fintech, and Solana Ecosystem Participants**. It offers deep insight
  into advanced L2 architecture, UX design challenges in crypto payments, and strategic
  pivots in the stablecoin space.'
