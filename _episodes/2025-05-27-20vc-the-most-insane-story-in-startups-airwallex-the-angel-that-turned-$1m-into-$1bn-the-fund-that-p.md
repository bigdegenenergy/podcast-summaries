summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Airwallex - The Insane Startup Story with Jack
  Zhang


  This episode features an in-depth conversation with Jack Zhang, Co-founder and CEO
  of Airwallex, one of the world''s fastest-growing global payments and financial
  infrastructure companies. The discussion traces Zhang''s extraordinary journey from
  extreme financial hardship in his youth to building a company that achieved $1BN
  in revenue while maintaining 100% year-over-year growth for eight consecutive years.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Global Fintech Infrastructure and Hyper-Scaling**. Key
  themes include: overcoming early-life adversity, the importance of resilience, the
  evolution of cross-border payments (specifically critiquing the SWIFT system), the
  strategic decision-making behind massive funding rounds and acquisition rejections,
  and the operational philosophy of aggressive, non-budgeted scaling.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Critique of SWIFT:** Zhang detailed the fundamental flaws of the 1970s SWIFT
  system, highlighting its reliance on numerous intermediaries, high fees, slow settlement
  times (taking months for cross-border transfers), and limited data capacity (140
  characters per message), which leads to high false positive rates.

  *   **Airwallex''s Infrastructure Philosophy:** The initial concept for Airwallex
  was to move beyond the intermediary model, aiming to treat money movement like real-time
  data transfer over the internet, leveraging technology to create a fundamentally
  new system for global transactions.

  *   **Early Product Pivots:** The team initially considered building a Square-like
  POS system supporting NFC payments but ultimately pivoted due to internal debate
  (NFC vs. QR codes) and a critical real-world pain point encountered during their
  import/export side hustles: the broken international payments infrastructure.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Aggressive Scaling Philosophy:** Zhang explicitly stated he doesn''t believe
  in strict budgeting ("I don''t have a budget. I''m just higher as fast as possible,
  blow the dollar"), operating under the belief that rapid scaling and securing capital
  frequently were necessary to outpace competitors in the infrastructure space.

  *   **Valuation Milestones & Rejections:** The narrative highlighted several high-stakes
  moments, including rejecting a **$1.2BN acquisition offer from Stripe** when Airwallex
  only had $2M in revenue, and the dramatic story of a renowned global VC firm **pulling
  a term sheet**, costing them a potential billion-dollar gain.

  *   **Hyper-Growth Metrics:** The company achieved $1BN in transaction volume within
  nine months of launch and sustained **100% YoY growth from 2015 to 2023**, reaching
  $700M in ARR by early 2024.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jack Zhang (Co-founder & CEO, Airwallex):** The central figure, whose background
  includes working as an algorithmic trader, running numerous side businesses (import/export,
  real estate, coffee shops), and demonstrating extreme resilience forged by early
  financial insecurity.

  *   **Airwallex Co-founders:** Mentioned Jacob (CTO) and Max Lee (Head of Product
  Design), who were instrumental in the technical debates and early business ventures.

  *   **Stripe:** Mentioned as the potential acquirer that offered $1.2BN early in
  Airwallex''s journey.

  *   **SWIFT:** The incumbent global payment messaging network criticized for its
  outdated architecture.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  While not a deep dive into specific regulations, the discussion implicitly touches
  on regulatory friction: Zhang noted that early international payments were often
  conducted under personal names, leading to payment blocks and delays, underscoring
  the complexity of compliance and counterparty risk in legacy systems.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the future of fintech infrastructure lies in building
  systems that mimic the speed and efficiency of internet data transfer, fundamentally
  challenging decades-old architectures like SWIFT. Zhang’s success validates a strategy
  of aggressive, capital-fueled hyper-growth in infrastructure plays, prioritizing
  speed over immediate financial discipline.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Venture Capitalists, Fintech Founders, Enterprise
  Technology Leaders, and Growth Strategists** interested in operational scaling,
  high-stakes negotiation, and the challenges of building foundational global infrastructure.'
