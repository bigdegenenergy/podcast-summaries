summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Valuation, Talent Exodus, and the Future of Venture
  Capital


  This episode of 20VC, featuring Harry Stebbings alongside venture veterans Jason
  Lampkin and Rory O''Driscoll, dives deep into several high-profile recent events
  in the tech and investment world, focusing heavily on talent mobility, asset management
  valuations, and the evolving nature of founder commitment.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus areas are **Venture Capital Strategy and Operations**, **Talent
  Dynamics in High-Growth AI/Tech**, and **Asset Management M&A**. The discussion
  centers on the financial implications of founder decisions, the mechanics of selling
  VC-adjacent businesses, and the increasing transactional nature of the industry.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **AI Agent Performance Benchmark:** Intercom''s AI agent, Finn, is highlighted
  for its claimed ability to resolve up to **93% of customer queries automatically**,
  setting a high benchmark for current customer service AI solutions.

  *   **AI-Driven Security:** The sponsor Godio utilizes **advanced AI threat detection**
  to proactively block highly targeted, socially engineered scams (phishing, fake
  sites) before they reach the user, addressing the new threat landscape created by
  generative AI.

  *   **Platformization of Venture:** The discussion implicitly contrasts highly productizable
  businesses (like fund-of-funds or media arms) that can be sold versus pure partnership-driven
  firms (like traditional seed funds) whose value is intrinsically tied to the operating
  partners.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Industry Ventures Acquisition Valuation:** The $665M base price (up to $965M
  with earn-out) for Industry Ventures by Goldman Sachs translates to roughly a **10%
  multiple of Assets Under Management (AUM)**. This is deemed a fair market price
  for a secondary/fund-of-funds manager, contrasting with primary managers (like KKR/Carlyle)
  trading closer to 20% of AUM.

  *   **Asset Manager Rationale:** Goldman Sachs acquired Industry Ventures primarily
  for **platform expansion** into private assets and to distribute these high-fee
  products through their Apex platform to High-Net-Worth (HNW) and Ultra-HNW clients,
  offsetting declining profitability in public asset management.

  *   **Founder Loyalty vs. Liquidity:** The $3.5B exit/move by Andrew Tulloch from
  Thinking Machines highlights the extreme liquidity available to top talent, forcing
  investors to re-evaluate founder commitment as a **risk factor** requiring stronger
  vesting and repurchase rights (e.g., longer cliffs, 6-year vesting).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Andrew Tulloch (Thinking Machines Co-founder):** Left his high-valuation AI
  company (reportedly $10B post-money) to join Meta for a reported $3.5B, sparking
  debate about founder loyalty.

  *   **Thinking Machines:** An AI company that raised significant capital ($2B mentioned)
  before a co-founder''s departure.

  *   **Industry Ventures (Hans S/Hans):** The fund-of-funds acquired by Goldman Sachs,
  praised for building a highly monetizable, productizable asset management business
  over 25 years.

  *   **Goldman Sachs (GS):** The acquirer, leveraging the deal to bolster its private
  asset distribution channels.

  *   **Arthur Rock:** Mentioned as an OG West Coast VC, illustrating the historical
  context of venture investing and the intimidating nature of early industry titans.

  *   **SoftBank/ARM/OpenAI:** Mentioned in the title context, noting SoftBank borrowed
  $5B against ARM holdings to invest further into OpenAI, signaling continued high-stakes
  AI deployment.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No specific regulatory discussions were detailed, but the conversation touched upon
  the **contractual structures** needed to protect investors when founders are incentivized
  by massive personal wealth events (e.g., stricter vesting schedules, repurchase
  rights upon departure).


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is heading toward:

  *   **Increased Transactionalism:** Relationships matter less than the highest price/auction
  process, especially for founders with high leverage.

  *   **Premium on Productizable Businesses:** Firms with scalable fee streams (asset
  gathering, media) will command significantly higher M&A multiples than partnership-driven
  investment shops.

  *   **Re-evaluation of Founder Risk:** Investors must adapt to a world where multi-billion
  dollar offers can lure away co-founders from seed-stage companies, necessitating
  tighter legal protections.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This podcast is most valuable for **Venture Capital Professionals (GPs and LPs),
  Tech Founders, and Investment Bankers** focused on the financial technology and
  private markets sectors.'
