    your role in the organization, and come up with the questions to ask for you.

  text: But an AI, like Orion here, can be quite well trained on, 'You see this? This
    is this person's job. This is the background of their role in the organization,'

    That is obviously a very key element of agent application architectures.

    structure to include organizational culture, jargon, and institutional knowledge,

    you define a month or quarter or a timeframe?

    decay management (knowledge expiry) in AI systems to prevent reliance on stale
    or outdated information.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think making sure that you understand how long a piece of information is
    good for has never been more important. It's always been important... That is
    something that we really need to consider and account for because if we pull all
    of the facts that a system like ours has gathered and don't treat them appropriately,
    like with some temporal weighting, then we're probably going to get confused.

    agent-to-agent (A2A) interactions, highlighting the immaturity of current protocols

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But if we've suddenly got proxies for every single employee in an organization
    interacting with virtual proxies in another organization, I mean, this is very
    out of the territory, and some of the protocols that we're building on top of
    don't even have the concept of identity or even basic security measures.
  topic: safety/predictions
- impact_reason: A strong cautionary statement against connecting private data to
    general-purpose LLM harnesses (like public ChatGPT/Cloud Desktop) that also have
    internet access, citing a critical security risk (data exfiltration via untrusted
    input).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If I was a technology leader or data leader in a large organization, there's
    absolutely no way that I would ever allow our private enterprise data to be connected
    to one of those harnesses because then you get into a situation where you have
    the three things that Simon Willison has kind of centered—the touch the third
    rail that you just don't touch—because you suddenly have a model that has access
    to private data, but it also has access to the internet.

    solutions: isolation from the public internet to prevent prompt injection attacks
    leading to data exfiltration.'
  relevance_score: 10

  text: The other piece of building any sort of generative AI-powered system, particularly
    in an agentic context, is the evolutionary aspect of how do you make changes and
    feel confident that the changes that you made didn't either introduce some completely
    unproductive behaviors or degrade the capabilities of the overall system...

    for real-time, in-flight performance monitoring and quality control within a running
    system.

    dynamic self-improvement by iteratively updating their own prompts/instructions
    based on immediate feedback.

  topic: strategy/technical
- impact_reason: 'Identifies the ''next frontier'' for agentic AI: moving from analysis
    tools to custom tools that execute full operational jobs within enterprise systems
    of record, contingent on responsibility/confidence.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We're not yet getting into the territory where we have completely custom tools
    that would allow for actions to happen in somebody's systems of record or that
    sort of thing. I think that we'd certainly like to go there when we have the confidence
    with our customer, of course, that that would be the responsible thing to do.
    But that's going to be very interesting when we start to build custom tools that
    are not only ergonomic for doing analysis but also just to do a full end-to-end
    job in an organization, like an operational job. And I think that's the next frontier.
  topic: predictions/business

    probabilistic, making them challenging for tasks requiring absolute, repeatable
    consistency, which is often mandatory in business.'
  relevance_score: 10

    or attempt tasks outside its true capability boundaries.
  relevance_score: 10

- impact_reason: Provides a clear, actionable constraint against using LLMs in ultra-low-latency,
    real-time systems due to inherent architectural latency.
  relevance_score: 10

  text: I think also anything where latency is super important, like if split seconds
    are important, don't put an LLM there. It has different cycles of responding and

summary: '## Podcast Summary: From Probabilistic to Trustworthy: Building Orion, an
  Agentic Analytics Platform


  This 72-minute episode of the AI Engineering Podcast features an in-depth discussion
  with **Lucas Talosen (CEO)** and **Drew Gilson** of **Gravity**, the company behind
  **Orion**, an agentic analytics platform. The conversation centers on bridging the
  gap between raw data and actionable business insights using advanced AI, with a
  critical focus on achieving **trust and accuracy** in enterprise analytics.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the development and deployment of **agentic analytics platforms**
  (like Orion) designed to automate and enhance business intelligence (BI) and data
  analysis. Key themes include overcoming the limitations of traditional BI tools,
  leveraging LLMs for deep analytical reasoning, ensuring enterprise-grade accuracy,
  and shifting the paradigm from reactive dashboard monitoring to proactive, context-aware
  insight delivery.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Grounding for Accuracy:** To achieve enterprise-level trust, Orion must connect
  to a **ground source of truth** (e.g., fact tables, dbt models) that its quality
  assurance agents can use to validate LLM-generated insights, moving beyond naive
  text-to-SQL approaches.

  *   **Asynchronous Deep Analytics:** Orion is designed to think **asynchronously**
  (e.g., overnight) about user roles, upcoming meetings, and organizational data context,
  enabling "deep analytics" like preparing comprehensive pre-meeting briefings, which
  traditional BI cannot support.

  *   **Probabilistic Reasoning via Redundancy:** While LLMs are probabilistic, high
  confidence in scalar answers can be achieved through **parallel test-time compute**
  (running the query multiple times) to ensure the model consistently derives the
  same result from the grounded data source.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Bridging the Analyst Gap:** Orion directly addresses the persistent gap between
  data experts and business users by embedding analytical best practices (cohort analysis,
  root cause analysis) directly into an agent that understands the user''s role and
  context.

  *   **Action-Oriented Insights:** The platform emphasizes connecting insights to
  **actionable recommendations**. It investigates both positive (upward) and negative
  (downward) metric changes, moving beyond the traditional BI tendency to only focus
  on "red numbers" (problems).

  *   **Proactive Delivery:** The business model relies on **pushing insights** directly
  into existing workflows (Email, Slack) where users already operate, removing the
  friction of forcing users to visit separate dashboards.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Lucas Talosen & Drew Gilson:** Founders of Gravity, both with deep backgrounds
  in data and analytics, stemming from their time at **Looker** (acquired by Google)
  and subsequent roles within Google''s data and AI teams.

  *   **Orion:** The agentic analytics platform being built by Gravity.

  *   **Looker:** Mentioned as the foundation where the founders identified the core
  problem of the data-business gap.

  *   **Prefect/Fast MCP:** Briefly mentioned in the podcast intro as an example of
  modern orchestration tools solving infrastructure challenges in ML workflows (though
  not the main topic of the interview).


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the future of BI is **agentic and proactive**. The industry
  is moving away from static dashboards where users must manually seek information
  toward intelligent systems that understand context, perform deep, iterative analysis,
  and deliver synthesized, actionable intelligence directly to the user, fundamentally
  changing organizational behavior regarding data interaction.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI/ML Engineers, Data Leaders (CDOs, VPs of
  Data), Product Managers building data tools, and Investors** focused on the enterprise
  AI and Business Intelligence landscape. It requires a professional understanding
  of LLM limitations, data warehousing concepts (dbt), and agentic system design.'
