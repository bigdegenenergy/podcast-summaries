  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: In crypto, market making is slightly different where they have these option
    agreements, which as far as my research, there's no real counterpart to this in
    TradFi.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Detailed explanation of the non-standard incentive structure (options
    based on TWAP) used to compensate crypto market makers, which can lead to perverse
    incentives.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And then they have this option with a strike price that sometimes depends
    on the agreement. Sometimes it's the last round price. More sort of standard is
    that it's some kind of premium to a TWAP post-launch. So it might be a seven-day
    TWAP post-launch, and the strike price is 25% to 50% above that.
  topic: defi
- impact_reason: Directly links the non-standard option-based compensation structure
    for MMs to the potential for market manipulation (pump and dump).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And what that does is it does create a bit of an incentive to, put it simply,
    pump and dump.
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: 'Provides actionable strategic advice for token issuers: use fixed-fee
    retainers for market making instead of performance-based options to avoid conflicts
    of interest and manipulation risks.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And actually, I think what we recommend to most of our portfolio projects,
    especially the ones that have the leverage to do this, is to just hire a market
    maker on a basic retainer and ask them to just make markets, guarantee a certain
    bid spread, a certain uptime, the kind of things they do, because it's just a
    lot less messy than having these option agreements which tend to backfire...
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: 'A direct call for increased transparency: projects should disclose
    which MMs they are working with to allow for better market surveillance.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And they should actually announce that, so that you can pick it up and see
    what's happening in the order book and whom is doing it.
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: Broadens the theme of transparency beyond market making to encompass
    the entire crypto ecosystem (OTC, secondary markets), identifying it as the core
    systemic issue.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Transparency is the key component here, to be honest, because that has been
    lacking on all fronts. That's not only does it go to market making, but goes to
    us as well as OTC providers, secondary market, private market, the price movements,
    whatever.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: 'Proposes a concrete, proactive solution for transparency: wallet
    tagging for key stakeholders (foundation, team) at the time of allocation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So what I would recommend is at the beginning of this all's allocation, just
    tag these wallets like, 'Hey, this is the foundation wallet. This is the CEO,
    this is the co-founders,' whatever. So you can backtrack those and figure out
    whom is actually selling which kind of assets in on which wallet.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: 'Identifies the core systemic inertia: exchanges and MMs benefit
    financially from the current opaque status quo, creating resistance to reform.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's just that no one's really incentivized to do this. Like, both the market
    makers and the exchanges really benefit from the status quo, at least short-term,
    right? Like exchanges make money on fees. They make a lot of money on the low
    float, high FDV matter.
  topic: business
- impact_reason: Articulates the fundamental conflict between global digital finance
    and fragmented national regulations, suggesting a need for supranational oversight.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Because in a way, it's almost like we're in this digital world where it's
    global, but then the meatspace world of regulations, it's all divided up by country.
    So it sort of feels like there would need to be some kind of super-national crypto
    organization.
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: 'Provides a definitive summary of the required transparency: token
    ownership, MM loan amounts, and option strike prices must be open-sourced.'

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Crypto Pump & Dumps Have Become the Ugly Norm. Can They
  Be Stopped? - Ep. 834


  This 77-minute episode of Unchained, hosted by Laura Shin, dives deep into the opaque
  and often manipulative world of **crypto market making**, specifically addressing
  how incentive structures can lead to pump-and-dump schemes, using the recent **Movement
  Labs scandal** as a central case study.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Market Making in Crypto**, contrasting its theoretical function
  (providing liquidity) with its problematic reality in the current ecosystem, particularly
  concerning token issuance agreements, incentive structures, and the lack of transparency.
  Secondary topics include OTC trading, regulatory arbitrage, and the role of centralized
  exchanges (CEXs) in policing these activities.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Non-Standard Option Agreements:** Unlike traditional finance (TradFi), crypto
  market-making deals often involve the project loaning tokens to the market maker
  (MM) and granting them a call option. The strike price is frequently set at a premium
  (e.g., 25-50%) above a post-launch Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP), creating
  a direct incentive for the MM to artificially inflate the price to exercise the
  option profitably (a pump-and-dump mechanism).

  *   **Alternative Fee Structure:** A less problematic model involves paying market
  makers a **flat, fixed retainer fee** purely for providing liquidity and maintaining
  bid-ask spreads, decoupling their compensation from token performance.

  *   **Liquidity Gaps and Slippage:** The necessity of market makers is highlighted
  by real-world examples, such as experiencing 22% slippage on a seven-figure on-chain
  transaction on a major chain, demonstrating the severe liquidity issues that MMs
  are meant to solve.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Incentive Misalignment:** The core investment risk stems from MMs being incentivized
  for upside rather than neutral market provision, leading to potential manipulation
  that harms retail investors.

  *   **Founder Responsibility:** Founders are advised to avoid performance-based
  option agreements and instead pay MMs for service delivery (uptime, spread guarantees)
  to maintain cleaner incentives.

  *   **Market Structure Concentration:** A small number of top market makers (estimated
  at the top seven) control the vast majority (95%) of the industry''s business, creating
  high barriers to entry for smaller, potentially more competitive firms.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Movement Labs:** The central subject of the scandal, involving market makers
  Web Report and Run Tech, who allegedly executed a contract incentivizing a pump-and-dump,
  resulting in Binance banning Web Report.

  *   **Delphine Labs (Jose):** Provided the framework for understanding the problematic
  option agreements common in crypto market making.

  *   **Second Lane (Omar Shakim):** An established OTC desk provider who noted that
  founders often lack visibility into their token''s trading activity post-launch.

  *   **Stix (Taren Subberwal):** Emphasized the lack of transparency, noting that
  multiple MMs often work in silos, and that exchanges benefit from the status quo
  due to trading fees.

  *   **Hester Peirce:** Mentioned in reference to her proposed safe harbor rules,
  which suggest projects should disclose market-making arrangements.

  *   **Wintermute (Gidey):** Mentioned in a related discussion (The Chopping Block)
  regarding the difficulty of knowing all market makers, especially those operating
  in Asia.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **TradFi Parallels:** The discussion drew strong parallels between current crypto
  market manipulation and historical practices in TradFi (like Jesse Livermore''s
  activities), which led to strict rules against spoofing, layering, and front-running
  customer orders.

  *   **Enforcement Leverage:** The most effective regulatory path suggested is leveraging
  **Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)**. Since most CEXs seek US access, they can be compelled
  to enforce best practices (e.g., requiring listed tokens to use regulated MMs or
  follow specific standards).

  *   **Self-Policing Potential:** Similar to the social custom of requiring audits,
  the industry could adopt a social norm where using reputable, transparent MMs becomes
  a prerequisite for legitimacy, reflecting poorly on projects that use shady operators.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is at an inflection point where the current
  opaque market-making structures are unsustainable due to scandals like Movement''s.
  Future health depends on either **industry self-regulation** (top MMs setting standards)
  or **exchange-enforced compliance**, likely driven by the desire of CEXs to maintain
  access to lucrative US markets. Without change, the "ugly norm" of pump-and-dumps
  will continue to erode retail trust.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Founders, Institutional Investors,
  Compliance Officers, and Crypto Traders/Analysts** who need a deep, professional
  understanding of the structural risks embedded in token liquidity provision and
  issuance agreements.'
