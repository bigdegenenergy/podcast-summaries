    the L1 has sufficient resources/incentives to maintain and improve the core infrastructure.'
  relevance_score: 10

  text: I think this pivot is sort of a realization that you can't give away all of

    two are sort of at odds, fundamentally at odds with each other.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: A direct critique of the economic execution of EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding),
    arguing that zeroing out blob fees prematurely destroyed L1 revenue without a
    clear replacement plan.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: ETH made a bunch of strategic errors around their revenue, which dropped,
    which turns just mentioning, especially with respect to blobs and the 4844 upgrade,
    where they basically set the price of blobs from their most price-insensitive
    users, which were the rollups, to zero for no reason.
  topic: defi/technology
- impact_reason: A powerful statement contrasting the focus areas of different blockchain
    development communities, suggesting that deep systems/hardware optimization (like
    Solana's approach) is crucial for raw performance.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: On ETH, I learned how blockchain works. On Solana, I learned how a computer
    works. And it turns out that learning how a computer works is a lot more important
    for making a blockchain go fast than knowing how the blockchain works.
  topic: technology/strategy
- impact_reason: Articulates the original, highly optimistic bet Ethereum made on
    ZK technology—that computation would become nearly free via exponential proof
    optimization, making L1 speed irrelevant.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think there was kind of this belief, you know... that ZK would just have
    a really crazy exponential growth curve and it would be, you know, people would
    basically be able to run ZK proving stuff so efficiently by 2025 that the blockchain
    would only really need that. You would never really need to, you know, a blockchain
    would just be storing proofs.
  topic: technology/adoption
- impact_reason: Quantifies the performance gap between Solana and Ethereum, showing
    that the performance increase far outstrips the increase in hardware cost (100x
    capacity vs 10x hardware).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: we have about 10x the hardware and bandwidth requirements... But we already
    have 100x performance in terms of capacity. We have like something like 30x faster
    block times.
  topic: technology/scalability
- impact_reason: 'A sharp critique of Ethereum''s engineering mindset: instead of
    optimizing within defined constraints (like hardware/decentralization), they changed
    the optimization goal entirely, suggesting a failure to maximize within the existing
    framework.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What Ethereum did is just said, 'These are our constraints.' Clearly, we're
    such geniuses that we've hit those constraints. So the only way that we could
    possibly make the blockchain better is to change what we are optimizing for, instead
    of just optimize the objective function that you're given.

    gap between theoretical research and actual code implementation, seen as a competitive
    disadvantage.'

    most critical positive development for Ethereum's near-term performance.
  relevance_score: 10

  text: The number one most important positive thing for EF is what Poesch is working
    on right now, which is network coding, and it's a derivative of what we're doing

  topic: technology

    existential for Ethereum''s short-to-medium term viability.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Single most important change for Ethereum in the next two years will be that.
    If it goes in, if it doesn't go in, I think it's completely cooked because that's
    a big deal.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: 'A critical warning about ecosystem health: retaining existing liquidity
    isn''t enough; the ability to attract and retain *new* asset creation is vital
    for long-term survival, a key dynamic in blockchain competition.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And if you become a place where new assets don't stay, like they disperse,
    then you will slowly die, right? Like you will diffuse. And I think people don't
    appreciate that as much as they should in Ethereum because they're just like,
    'Oh, we have like the highest stablecoin density.'
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: A sharp critique of Ethereum's core culture, arguing that a lack
    of focus on application developers (the primary value creators) hinders ecosystem
    growth and innovation.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: part of the reason, in my opinion, is that I don't think Ethereum developers
    or researchers view application developers as their customer. Like, fundamentally,
    I think that there's like this fundamental disconnect.
  topic: business/strategy

    core researchers/developers and active users/traders regarding the chain's primary
    function and optimization target.

    trading. Does anybody agree or disagree with that statement?' And zero hands went

  topic: investment/adoption
- impact_reason: Directly links the philosophical disagreement over chain optimization
    (neutrality vs. targeted utility like a 'decentralized mass deck') to a major
    strategic move (moving to Solana).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So that's why part of why I moved to Solana. But I thought it was very characteristic
    of the infinite garden type of approach versus the, 'We want to be decentralized
    mass deck. Let's build for it.'
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: 'A crucial self-assessment from the Solana perspective: achieving
    speed/cheapness alone is insufficient for mass adoption; a new ingredient (likely
    related to user experience or specific features) is required.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We still believe we want to be decentralized mass deck, and we need to change
    our approach because the first thing we tried to do of making the blockchain super
    fast and cheap, we succeeded in making it fast and cheap, maybe not quite fast
    enough, not quite cheap enough yet, but it looks like that is not enough to produce
    decentralized mass deck. So we need to add another ingredient.
  topic: technology/adoption
- impact_reason: Critiques the Ethereum EIP-4844 (blob gas) economics as inherently
    non-neutral because the subsidy heavily favors L2s over the dominant L1 user base
    (DeFi).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: L2s are 20% of our gas usage, DeFi is 80%, therefore we should slash the prices
    of L2 blob gas to zero? That's not credibly neutral at all.

    problem of developer and application retention across competing L2s.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Ethereum Gave Away Too Much for Too Long. Will
  Its Pivot Be Enough? - Ep. 829


  This 88-minute episode of Unchained, hosted by Laura Shin, features Tarun Chitra
  (CEO of Gotlin) and Max Resnick (Lead Economist at Anza) discussing the recent strategic
  pivot within the Ethereum ecosystem, contrasting its historical approach with competitors
  like Solana, and analyzing the implications for ETH''s future and price.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **Ethereum Ecosystem''s strategic pivot**, specifically
  addressing:

  *   The historical economic model of Ethereum (giving away transaction economics
  via L2s).

  *   The perceived failure of the L1-to-L2 pivot strategy in maintaining competitiveness.

  *   The necessity and implications of recent proposed changes to the Ethereum Layer
  1 (L1) roadmap, including gas limit increases and consensus layer simplification.

  *   A direct comparison of Ethereum''s development philosophy versus that of Solana.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Gas Limit Increase as a Major Shift:** The willingness to dramatically increase
  the L1 gas limit (from minor increments to potentially 100x) is seen as the most
  significant quantitative change, signaling a pivot away from catering strictly to
  solo stakers.

  *   **Bottleneck Misdiagnosis:** Max Resnick argues that Ethereum developers historically
  misidentified the bottleneck. They focused heavily on ZK-rollups to solve execution
  constraints, when the real constraint, especially relative to competitors, was consensus
  and block time/latency.

  *   **Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling:** The discussion highlights the debate over
  prioritizing horizontal scaling (L2s) over vertical scaling (L1 capacity). Experts
  suggest that scaling vertically and horizontally simultaneously is optimal, a path
  Ethereum delayed.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Revenue Collapse Post-EIP-4844:** The implementation of EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding)
  caused Ethereum''s revenue to drop "overnight" by pricing blob space too low, demonstrating
  a lack of short-term revenue forecasting during the pivot.

  *   **Competitive Pressure:** The sustained performance improvements of competitors
  (like Solana reaching a "10x better" threshold) forced Ethereum''s hand, suggesting
  that network effects alone are insufficient if the underlying product quality degrades
  significantly.

  *   **ETH Price Impact:** The pivot is framed as necessary for ETH''s long-term
  value proposition, as the previous strategy of giving away 90% of economics while
  failing to improve the core product was unsustainable.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Vitalik Buterin:** His recent blog posts proposing L1 simplification (e.g.,
  three-slot finality, reducing active validators) are heavily scrutinized. Max Resnick
  criticizes the timing, suggesting these ideas should have been implemented years
  ago, indicating a lag in adapting to new data.

  *   **Solana:** Frequently used as the benchmark for performance, highlighting how
  its design choices led to significantly faster block times and capacity despite
  only moderately higher hardware requirements (10x hardware vs. 100x capacity improvement).

  *   **Bitcoin Maxis:** Mentioned in the opening comment as an example of an extremist
  reaction to industry "scum," contrasting with Ethereum''s more ideological approach.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   The discussion touches on the historical context of Ethereum''s early days,
  where the team was highly concerned about SEC scrutiny (leading to maximal decentralization
  efforts), contrasting with Solana''s launch environment where competitors were more
  willing to accept regulatory risk for performance gains.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that Ethereum is finally recognizing the need to aggressively
  improve its core L1 performance (vertical scaling) alongside its L2 strategy. If
  the community successfully implements these changes—especially the gas limit increase
  and consensus simplification—it could halt the loss of ground to competitors. However,
  the delay in adaptation means Ethereum is playing catch-up, having lost years focusing
  on solving non-existent problems (like execution bottlenecks) while neglecting existing
  ones (latency and throughput).


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto Professionals, Blockchain Engineers,
  Investors, and Strategists** deeply involved in Layer 1 architecture, competitive
  analysis within the smart contract platform space, and understanding the economic
  trade-offs in decentralized network design.'
