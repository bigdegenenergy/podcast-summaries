    overnight? Rents in New York City went up 15%. Why? Because the landlord said,
    okay, well, they can't pay you the 15%, which is a one-time charge, I have to
    pay it. I'm not coming out of pocket. So they raised the rents 15%.
  topic: Business/Strategy

    how a short-term perceived benefit turned into a long-term financial burden for
    consumers.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is why the renters are worse off. In the old model, it was a one-time
    fee. If you stay in that apartment for three years, you pay the additional 15%
    every single year. So now let's go back to that $7,500, which was a one-time fee.
    Now you end up actually paying over $22,000 over the three-year period because
    they changed this rule.

    debate through a lens of conviction.

  text: Well, the rules are only for the people who don't believe in Bitcoin. That's
    why they're creating rules. Because if you believe in Bitcoin, you buy it and
    you don't sell it. If you don't sell it, you don't pay taxes.

    of any single political administration, suggesting macro forces are dominant.

  text: What do you think successful look like at the end of the Trump administration
    for Bitcoin? Well, at the end of the day, the only quantifiable metric is just
    Bitcoin's price is higher. But I don't think that that has anything to do with
    Trump. I think that he can help, but I think it was going up regardless.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: #1569 Anthony & Polina Pompliano | Is the Fed Too Late
  to Stop Bitcoin’s Rise?


  This episode of the Pomp Podcast, featuring Polina Pompliano, dives into the current
  state of the US dollar, macroeconomic policy shifts, the political drama between
  Trump and Musk, and the accelerating relevance of Bitcoin amid these changes.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Macroeconomics and Monetary Policy**, specifically the
  weakening US dollar, the potential for an economic boom driven by cheap capital,
  the political push for fiscal spending versus cost-cutting, and the increasing adoption
  and regulatory focus on **Bitcoin** as a superior monetary asset.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Dollar Weakness is Relative:** The 10% weakening of the dollar is primarily
  measured against other fiat currencies (like the Euro), reflecting relative monetary
  policies and trade dynamics.

  *   **Bitcoin as the True Benchmark:** The most significant trend is the dollar''s
  crash against Bitcoin, suggesting Bitcoin is strengthening as the world''s ultimate
  non-sovereign currency.

  *   **Taxation Paradox:** Current tax rules penalize Bitcoin when used as a currency
  (spending) but not when held as an investment, creating an "equality fight" where
  Bitcoin should be treated like any other asset based on its use case.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Boom Conditions:** A weak dollar combined with falling interest rates (a policy
  goal for Trump) creates conditions for an economic boom due to cheaper capital access.

  *   **Tariff Efficacy Questioned:** Despite high tariff revenue collection (over
  $100B), the expected consumer inflation did not materialize, suggesting foreign
  producers, not US consumers, bore the brunt of the cost.

  *   **Bitcoin as the Ultimate Hedge:** The conversation strongly implies that Bitcoin''s
  rise is inevitable as fiat currencies globally debase, making it the primary long-term
  store of value.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jerome Powell:** Heavily criticized by both Pomp and Polina for being "behind
  the curve" on inflation and monetary policy, leading to Trump''s public pressure
  campaign.

  *   **Donald Trump:** Advocating for aggressive interest rate cuts and growth-focused
  policy, while simultaneously facing internal resistance to his cost-cutting mandates
  within government structures.

  *   **Elon Musk:** Portrayed as an ally of cost-cutting, whose public feud with
  Trump is viewed largely as political entertainment ("pro wrestling") that benefits
  both egos but distracts from substantive issues.

  *   **Scott Bessent:** Mentioned as a potential Treasury Secretary favorite who
  is ready to replace Powell if nominated by Trump.

  *   **Senator Cynthia Lummis:** Highlighted as a key legislative driver working
  on amendments to ease tax burdens on small crypto transactions (de minimis exemption).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Fed Independence vs. Pressure:** While the Fed is meant to be independent,
  political pressure (from Biden privately, Trump publicly) is common. The core critique
  is that Powell failed by letting inflation run hot.

  *   **Crypto Legislation Timeline:** There is an expectation that comprehensive
  US crypto legislation, including rules for the market, will be finalized by September
  30th.

  *   **De Minimis Exemption:** A key policy recommendation is the implementation
  of a *de minimis* tax exemption (e.g., $600-$800) for small Bitcoin transactions
  used as currency, treating it like cash rather than a taxable asset sale.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a bifurcation in economic strategy: either a return to
  cost-cutting (which is politically difficult) or doubling down on growth via money
  printing and debasement, which further solidifies Bitcoin''s role as the necessary
  escape valve. The political noise between Trump and Musk is seen as distracting
  entertainment, but the underlying push for regulatory clarity in crypto is accelerating.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Financial Professionals, Macro Investors, and
  Crypto/Web3 Strategists** who track the intersection of US monetary policy, political
  maneuvering, and the long-term trajectory of digital assets.'
