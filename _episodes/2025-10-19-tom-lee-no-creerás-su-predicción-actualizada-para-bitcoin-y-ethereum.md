summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: TOM LEE: No creerás su predicción actualizada
  para BITCOIN y ETHEREUM


  This 15-minute episode, hosted by Juan Luis of "Crypto Markets and Memes," focuses
  heavily on updated long-term price predictions for Bitcoin (BTC) from Fundstrat''s
  Tom Lee, alongside a review of recent crypto market performance, on-chain metrics,
  and regulatory developments.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Cryptocurrency Investment Analysis and Long-Term Price Forecasting**,
  specifically centered on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Secondary topics include market volatility
  driven by geopolitical news (US-China trade), analysis of top-performing altcoins,
  and the status of US Bitcoin ETF applications.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin Price Action & Patterns:** Tom Lee''s analysis suggests Bitcoin is
  forming a "megaphone pattern," which has historically supported the lower bounds,
  potentially leading to a move back toward the average price area and a possible
  breakout above **$126,000** in November.

  *   **Mining Cost Benchmark:** The episode highlights the significant disparity
  in the global cost of Bitcoin production, noting that in Spain, the cost is around
  **$162,000** (above the current market price), while in Iran, it is as low as **$1,320**,
  illustrating the impact of local energy costs.

  *   **On-Chain Metric Teaser:** The host mentions an exclusive analysis of a key
  on-chain metric that has historically signaled profitable entry points during significant
  market corrections, suggesting current levels align with past bottoms.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Tom Lee''s Extreme BTC Target:** Tom Lee provided a working theory that Bitcoin''s
  fair value could eventually reach between **$1.5 million and $2.1 million**. He
  also mentioned a more immediate 2025 target of **$150,000** for BTC.

  *   **Ethereum vs. Bitcoin Narrative:** Lee suggests that while Bitcoin is "digital
  gold," Ethereum (ETH) could potentially "flip" Bitcoin in market value, similar
  to how Wall Street equity markets surpassed gold''s dominance post-1971, driven
  by the growth of stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

  *   **Market Correction:** The market closed a second consecutive negative week,
  with BTC dropping over 5% this past week, although the recent upward movement in
  the last hour has reduced short positions betting on further correction.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Tom Lee (Fundstrat):** The central expert providing long-term price targets
  for BTC and the ETH/BTC value proposition.

  *   **Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy):** Mentioned for continuing his pattern of
  announcing new Bitcoin purchases, reinforcing institutional accumulation.

  *   **Lin (Jubi Lion Founder):** Announced the launch of a new venture to sponsor
  a strategic reserve fund initially valued at **$1 billion** in SOL (Solana).

  *   **ETF Applicants:** Mentioned firms like **Bitwise, Grayscale, and 21 Shares**
  regarding pending spot ETF approval decisions.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **US Government Shutdown Impact:** The temporary closure of the US federal government
  is delaying the decision-making process for several pending spot Bitcoin ETF applications.
  The host anticipates decisions might be seen in the coming days or weeks once the
  shutdown is resolved.

  *   **US-China Trade War:** Declarations from Donald Trump suggesting Chinese President
  Xi Jinping is open to a commercial agreement are noted as a potential source of
  future market volatility.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation points toward a long-term bullish outlook driven by institutional
  adoption (Saylor, ETFs) and fundamental shifts in digital asset dominance (Lee’s
  ETH/BTC theory). The immediate future suggests potential volatility based on geopolitical
  news and the resolution of the US government shutdown impacting ETF approvals. The
  host is also actively engaging the community through token giveaways tied to newsletter
  subscriptions, fostering direct engagement.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Investors, Traders, and Financial Analysts** interested in long-term valuation
  models, technical analysis, and institutional sentiment regarding major cryptocurrencies.'
