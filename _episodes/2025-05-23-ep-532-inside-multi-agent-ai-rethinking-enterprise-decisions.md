  text: The reason for this resurgence today in popularity is because by using a large
    language model as the brain of an agent, that allows it to reason using the reasoning
    of these large language models. And also it understands language. So you can just
    simply express to it what its responsibilities are, what the scope is, what you

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: When you think of the large language model, that's just a model. You give
    it some inputs and it produces some outputs. It doesn't really do stuff. It's
    pretty general purpose usually, but it doesn't really do stuff. The moment you
    recast it as an agent, you write some code outside of that model that allows the
    system to decide. So it actually enacts the decisions that the large language
    model is asking you to do.

  text: If you have an agent and you've consciously decided that that agent will have
    as its tool set this ability to run code in a container and see the result of
    that code, then the same task of writing the code suddenly becomes much more tractable
    because the LLM can say, hey, I want this piece of code that I wrote to be run,
    and then the external code within the agent runs it, shows it the result. Maybe
    there's a runtime error or something, and it can correct that and iterate on it

    it down to the hierarchy. And it was as if my team is looking at the email and
    they would come back sometimes even, giving me the text of the email response
    that they thought I would be sending back.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: EP 532: Inside Multi-Agent AI: Rethinking Enterprise
  Decisions


  This episode of the Everyday AI show features **Babak, CTO of AI at Cognizant**,
  to discuss the paradigm shift occurring in enterprise decision-making driven by
  the rise of **Multi-Agent AI systems**. The conversation moves beyond the buzzword
  status of "agents" to explore their technical definition, practical enterprise deployment,
  and the critical challenges of autonomy and control.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)** within the
  enterprise context. Key areas covered include: defining what constitutes an AI agent
  versus a standalone Large Language Model (LLM), the organic evolution toward MAS
  in business operations, the promise of breaking down organizational silos, and the
  crucial need for responsible engineering, safety, and fallback mechanisms when granting
  autonomy to these systems.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Agent Definition:** An AI agent is an AI system (often powered by an LLM brain)
  that is equipped with **tools** and possesses a level of **autonomy** to decide
  *when* and *how* to use those tools based on its environment and task description.
  LLMs alone are general-purpose models; agents enact decisions.

  *   **Agentification Impact:** Cognizantâ€™s platform, NeuroAI, demonstrated the power
  of "agentification"â€”replacing software modules with interacting agentsâ€”which dramatically
  reduced Proof-of-Concept (POC) time from 10-12 weeks down to **10-15 minutes**.

  *   **Reducing Inconsistency:** While hallucinations persist, multi-agent architectures
  can *reduce* inconsistency by breaking complex tasks into smaller, scoped tasks,
  thereby limiting the scope for error in any single LLM component. Furthermore, new
  techniques (like those presented at NeurIPS) allow for **measuring output uncertainty/confidence**
  in LLMs.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Operational Efficiency:** The promise of MAS is significant operational productivity
  by allowing a network of specialized agents to handle complex, multi-objective tasks
  that previously required extensive human coordination (e.g., navigating disparate
  internal systems like HR and IT).

  *   **Organic Adoption vs. Controlled Design:** While multi-agent environments are
  emerging organically as companies deploy individual LLM solutions, business leaders
  must transition from this ad-hoc approach to a **conscious engineering discipline**
  to maintain control and safety.

  *   **Shifting from RPA to CUA:** The industry is moving beyond Robotic Process
  Automation (RPA) to Computer Using Agents (CUA), where the system exhibits genuine
  decision-making capability rather than just scripted actions.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Babak (CTO of AI, Cognizant):** The expert guest, providing deep insight from
  his background, including his work on the natural language technology that informed
  **Siri''s development**.

  *   **Cognizant NeuroAI:** Highlighted as a platform that has been successfully
  "agentified" to accelerate decision-making systems development.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The future involves enterprises building complex, interconnected **multi-agent intranets**
  where agents communicate to resolve complex user needs (like handling a life event
  such as a child turning 26, which impacts payroll, benefits, and time off). However,
  the industry is not yet ready to fully defer decision-making to machines; **human-in-the-loop**
  mechanisms and clear accountability remain essential, even if agents are technically
  superior decision-makers.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **CTOs, AI Strategy Leaders, Enterprise Architects,
  and Senior Technology Professionals** who are moving beyond initial LLM experimentation
  and are planning the scaled, operational deployment of autonomous AI systems within
  large organizations.'
