  text: Maybe my favorite part of the conversation is we talk about how crypto companies
    like Wintermute are turning their attention and potentially going after traditional
    market players as well. This is the future of finance, and Wintermute is sitting
    at the tip of innovation and trying to push forward for the entire industry.
  topic: adoption/strategy
- impact_reason: Provides a concrete, data-backed insight into the primary drivers
    of recent Bitcoin price action, shifting focus away from pure crypto-native buying.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: a pretty big change for the last six months has been basically what we see
    is two main drivers are traditional institutions. So think of it like big banks,
    BlackRock, Fidelity, that sort of world, on one hand, and basically pretty big
    retail aggregators, basically Robinhood, on the other side.
  topic: investment/adoption
- impact_reason: Provides a sophisticated explanation of how sophisticated users employ
    options (covered calls) not just for speculation, but for yield enhancement against
    a target price, reframing 'loss' metrics.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: if you look at options, a lot of it is basically around extra yield generation,
    for example, like selling covered call strategies, which the loss ratio—like,
    'loss ratio' might not be the right way to look at it because people are ultimately
    looking, 'Okay, I would sell my Bitcoin at whatever, $150K or whatever,' so I
    can just sell this covered call at the $150K strike.
  topic: DeFi/yield strategies
- impact_reason: 'Defines the competitive landscape: Bitcoin is mature/low-margin
    (''vanilla''), while altcoins represent the strategic ''wedge'' where specialized
    knowledge and liquidity provision are highly valuable.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: 'Bitcoin is here. It''s all very vanilla. There are markets on the rail, there
    are markets on CME. It''s very simple to price them; like everyone can do it.
    We have been active in all since forever... But altcoins, that''s really where—when
    I first started hearing about you guys—that''s really where I think you guys saw
    a wedge into the market: "We''re going to go and we''re going to serve a bunch
    of assets that maybe these other desks aren''t going to do."'
  topic: Business Strategy
- impact_reason: A powerful analogy comparing the chaotic, high-opportunity, high-risk
    environment of post-Soviet Russia in the 90s to the current crypto landscape.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's like the Russian '90s was very similar to crypto in the way. Okay? Because
    it was very, like, it was very hardcore capitalism, hardcore, like a lot of opportunities,
    a lot of different things available, but also a lot of risks as well.
  topic: Adoption/Market Trends
- impact_reason: 'Articulates the necessary evolution for successful crypto-native
    firms: diversification beyond pure crypto into traditional finance (TradFi) assets.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: As a pro-crafter, we cannot stay focused on crypto forever. So we actually
    have to expand to TradFi. We have to expand to pretty much all asset classes.
  topic: Strategy/Adoption
- impact_reason: 'Pinpoints the core technological and operational advantage of blockchain/crypto
    infrastructure: 24/7 settlement and automation, contrasting it sharply with legacy
    finance limitations.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It is pretty interesting. I told you guys the securities. Yeah, I can say
    it is probably like the most interesting one because, yeah, how we transition
    from the current legacy system, which operates on fiat currencies, which operates
    basically five days a week, doesn't operate on the weekends, is closed on like
    every holiday, for example—like, how do we transition from that to pure 24/7 with
    and solving for all the challenges with how do you handle corporate actions, how
    do you handle dividends, how do you handle like basically this 24/7 aspect crypto
    is super comfortable with, of course?
  topic: Technology/Innovation
- impact_reason: Provides a concrete, massive scale metric for a leading crypto market
    maker, quantifying the sheer volume flowing through non-exchange infrastructure.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Yeah, basically, yeah, how much we trade. So it's anyway between like five
    to $10 billion a day in volumes.
  topic: Investment/Business
- impact_reason: 'A crucial insight: current, slower crypto exchange infrastructure
    inadvertently protects smaller, crypto-native market makers by excluding TradFi
    giants like Citadel from dominating.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If basically let's say Binance improved the latency to CME level, the last
    majority of those market makers will be competitively wiped out by basically like
    Jump, Citadel. Yeah. So in a way, it protects the crypto active, and also it makes
    markets more liquid on those exchanges as well because it basically levels the
    playing field quite a bit.
  topic: Regulation/Investment
- impact_reason: Highlights the significant, yet often unseen, power of major market
    makers like Wintermute in dominating crypto liquidity and market structure, contrasting
    with public awareness.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Wintermute. They're massive. Most of you probably never heard of them before,
    but they dominate crypto markets, and he's on a quest to become the richest man
    in the world.
  topic: business/market structure
- impact_reason: 'A highly counterintuitive observation: the crypto industry insiders
    are less focused on BTC during an ATH, suggesting capital rotation or a search
    for higher alpha elsewhere.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Bitcoin interest is exploding with the traditional firms, while crypto-native
    firms' interest is down 5%, I think. So what do you attribute that to? That's
    fascinating. Bitcoin's going all-time highs, and the people in the industry actually
    don't have their eyes on Bitcoin.
  topic: investment/market trends
- impact_reason: Explains the rotation out of Bitcoin into altcoins as a search for
    'beta'—a classic investment dynamic applied to the crypto market structure.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: People are always looking for Bitcoin beta effectively, like trying to get
    the beta exposure to Bitcoin by going to like Solana or some sort of else to try
    to outperform.
  topic: investment/strategy
- impact_reason: Identifies options trading as the key growth area in derivatives,
    driven by the demand for leverage and more complex financial instruments.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: A pretty big change this year is options. There's really a lot of interest
    in that. And part of it is just inherent leverage and also instruments compared
    to spot.
  topic: DeFi/derivatives
- impact_reason: Highlights the regulatory push (CFTC involvement) and the expansion
    of high-leverage products (perpetuals) onto major retail platforms like Robinhood.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Robinhood, they just announced that they're going to do perpetuals, for example,
    for European clients and beyond. Like, I'm pretty sure they're really working
    with the CFTC to get them approved in the US as well. But yeah, leveraged trading,
    basically, for all of their customers' leverage, is going to be a pretty big thing
    for them.
  topic: regulation/adoption
- impact_reason: 'Explains the primary driver for using OTC desks for altcoins: maintaining
    privacy and avoiding market impact/front-running due to the transparency of on-chain
    movements for smaller cap assets.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: especially if you look at altcoins. Yeah, it is very visible what you do.
    Like if you sit in a big, you know, Solana position or a Hyperliquid position,
    yeah, the whole market will see once you start moving your tokens to a centralized
    exchange.
  topic: technology/market structure
- impact_reason: 'Articulates the core challenge of market making in the long tail
    of crypto assets: information asymmetry and managing balance sheet risk across
    numerous volatile instruments.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: you have like 80 to 150 volatile assets. There's not a lot of information
    sometimes, especially as you push further and further in the coin list. How do
    you start thinking about underwriting the risk and the principal risk that you
    guys are taking on balance sheet risk...
  topic: Strategy/Risk Management
- impact_reason: Emphasizes the necessity of a hybrid CEX/DeFi strategy for comprehensive
    market coverage, acknowledging that significant liquidity for DeFi tokens resides
    on-chain.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: we're very big on the C side of things; we're very big on centralized exchanges,
    but we're also very big on DeFi, and that's where a big chunk of liquidity is
    for a lot of those DeFi tokens, for example.
  topic: Technology/DeFi
- impact_reason: Stresses that success in complex crypto markets (especially DeFi)
    requires deep protocol-level research beyond simple price action, including understanding
    upgrade risks.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: our research team is very advanced in understanding how a lot of those protocols
    work, like how to price them, how to understand the risks, like what happens if
    they upgrade their protocols, like all those kind of things.
  topic: Technology/Research
- impact_reason: Contrasts the founder's quantitative, risk-aware market making with
    his father's reliance on TA, highlighting the failure of models when facing extreme,
    unforeseen market crashes (like 2008).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: he basically did technical analysis. So he was like, he would have been my
    counterpart effectively in the markets. Yeah, he transferred money from his wallet
    to your wallet, right? And then basically when this 2007 crisis hit, he basically
    just lost it all because he was just like loaned the market, and he, like, he
    stopped losses for somewhere, but the market crashed way more than his models
    told.
  topic: Investment/Risk Management
- impact_reason: 'Identifies the initial business wedge: serving the post-ICO ecosystem
    by providing professional market-making services that many nascent protocols desperately
    needed.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The initial idea was back in 2018. We basically started serving—we went to
    market-making for projects, for protocols. And so the projects, they all are market-making
    for. Exactly. And the initial idea was, "Okay, there was 2017 ICO boom. There's
    a lot of protocols. All these protocols need market makers..."
  topic: Business Strategy
- impact_reason: Provides a specific, early example of institutional OTC service provision
    in the DeFi/Protocol space, focusing on employee liquidity needs (a novel service
    at the time).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Our first OTC business, I think it was sometime in 2020 when we basically
    started market-making for protocols again because it was starting to revive again.
    So, pretty sure our first OTC counterparty was Filecoin—not the Filecoin Foundation,
    but actually Filecoin employees because we were perfectly market-making for the
    Filecoin token. And we onboarded quite a few employees back then to help them
    to sell their Filecoin tokens.

    as a critical, high-value transition point for the entire financial ecosystem.

  text: Also, how do we move it from fiat rails to stablecoin rails, which is a massive
    fund-raising for legacy exchanges, but also for crypto exchanges?

    exchanges towards the highly profitable, yet less visible, market-making and OTC
    infrastructure.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I always think about it in terms of the best businesses in crypto. I think
    historically have been the exchanges. But now I think that there are a bunch of—you
    look at traditional finance. Citadel's doing pretty good. A bunch of these different
    firms that are either in the market-making business or they're doing some sort
    of OTC component, like all the things that you guys do, but just for the traditional
    world, those businesses are incredible in the traditional world.
  topic: Investment/Business

    being the only entity that successfully integrates market-making across CEXs,
    DeFi, and OTC desks.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: They are still very, very unique in crypto because we do everything. So we
    trade on centralized exchanges like Coinbase or Binance, we trade on DeFi, we
    trade—we do a bunch of OTC things, we trade with Robinhood. And they have very
    different sets of competitors.

    reliance on standard cloud infrastructure (like AWS) prevents the nanosecond-level
    optimization seen in HFT.'
  relevance_score: 9

    and it just doesn't allow for this optimization. Nanoseconds with a microsecond
    optimization.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #1574 Evgeny Gaevoy | Who’s Really Buying Bitcoin
  Right Now


  This episode of the Pomp Podcast features an in-depth conversation with **Evgeny
  Gaevoy**, Founder and CEO of **Wintermute**, one of the dominant forces in crypto
  market making and liquidity provision. The discussion centers on the current drivers
  of Bitcoin price action, the evolving landscape of crypto trading, and Wintermute’s
  unique position bridging traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized markets.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Cryptocurrency Market Structure and Liquidity Dynamics**,
  specifically identifying the major buyers driving the recent Bitcoin price surge,
  the increasing sophistication of trading instruments (like options), and the strategic
  role of Over-The-Counter (OTC) desks in market operations.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Shift in Buyer Concentration:** Recent Bitcoin and Ethereum trading volume
  is overwhelmingly driven by two main groups: **traditional institutions** (e.g.,
  BlackRock, Fidelity) and **large retail aggregators** (e.g., Robinhood). Traditional
  OTC counterparties are reportedly reducing their exposure.

  *   **Derivatives Adoption:** There is a significant surge in interest in **options
  trading** for major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven both by sophisticated
  traditional players accustomed to complex strategies and by educating crypto-native
  counterparties on advanced tools.

  *   **OTC Desk Utility:** OTC desks remain crucial for large players, particularly
  in altcoins, because they offer **time variance** in execution, allowing large trades
  to be executed without immediately signaling market intent or being front-run, which
  is difficult to hide on-chain or on public exchanges.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Institutional Dominance:** The current all-time high in Bitcoin is being fueled
  by institutional capital flowing through regulated channels (ETFs), rather than
  solely by grassroots retail accumulation.

  *   **"Bitcoin Beta" Chasing:** Crypto-native firms are showing reduced interest
  in Bitcoin (down 5% in the report) as they seek assets that can outperform Bitcoin,
  pushing further out on the risk curve (e.g., Solana, meme coins, or specific DeFi
  tokens like Hyperliquid).

  *   **Ethereum Reversal Play:** Ethereum is seeing renewed interest as a potential
  outperformer, largely because it has significantly lagged Bitcoin relative to its
  previous all-time highs, making it an attractive reversal candidate for capital
  seeking upside.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Evgeny Gaevoy (Wintermute CEO):** Founder of the major market-making firm,
  with a background in economics (Moscow High School of Economics) and 10 years in
  TradFi market making at **Optiver** before entering crypto in 2017.

  *   **BlackRock & Fidelity:** Cited as examples of the traditional financial institutions
  now driving significant Bitcoin demand via ETFs.

  *   **Robinhood/Public.com/eToro:** Mentioned as large fintech aggregators that
  are centralizing retail flow and are expected to introduce more leveraged products
  (like perpetuals) to their user bases.

  *   **Filecoin:** Mentioned as one of Wintermute''s earliest OTC counterparties,
  onboarding employees to help sell vested tokens.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched on the expansion of leveraged products: Robinhood is reportedly
  working with the **CFTC** to approve and offer perpetual futures to US clients,
  indicating a regulatory push to bring complex derivatives to broader retail audiences,
  mirroring trends seen in Europe.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the financial landscape is rapidly converging: crypto-native
  firms are seeking outperformance beyond Bitcoin, while traditional finance players
  are cementing their role as major capital allocators in the asset class. Wintermute
  is strategically positioned to serve both sides, leveraging its expertise in both
  centralized exchange (CEX) and decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity to underwrite
  risk across a vast array of assets. Gaevoy’s personal ambition is noted: to become
  the richest man in the world by pushing the boundaries of financial innovation through
  Wintermute.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Professionals, Institutional Investors,
  Traders, and Market Structure Analysts** who need granular insights into where institutional
  capital is flowing and how large-scale liquidity is managed in the current market
  cycle.'
