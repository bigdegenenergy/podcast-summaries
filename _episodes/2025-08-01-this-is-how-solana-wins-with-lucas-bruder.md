    can't discuss in a public forum or you can't like the counterparties that you're
    dealing with
  topics: []
- impact_reason: Establishes Gido's critical, near-ubiquitous role in current Solana
    transaction processing, setting the stage for why their upgrades matter.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Gido is one of Solana's most core infrastructure teams. If you transact on
    Solana, chances are that transaction will go through Gido's block engine for handling
    transactions.
  topic: Adoption/Infrastructure
- impact_reason: The central thesis of the episode; frames BAM as a potentially massive,
    foundational change for the Solana ecosystem.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Gido announced it would be overhauling its transaction architecture with its
    new Block Assembly Marketplace, or BAM. This is going to be one of the most consequential
    upgrades to Solana infrastructure ever.
  topic: Technology/Strategy
- impact_reason: Directly addresses the centralization concerns inherent in Gido's
    current market dominance.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I would say we also wanted to decentralize a little bit just because that
    is, yeah, there's a lot that goes through the block engine and I think that if
    we can open source it and try to decentralize it, it would just be a lot better
    for the network.
  topic: Regulation/Decentralization
- impact_reason: 'A concise summary of BAM''s multi-faceted goals: sequencing change,
    privacy, transparency, decentralization, and value creation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: BAM, which is a newer like a proposal that we're making to change like the
    way that transactions are kind of sequenced on the network to provide more privacy,
    more transparency, try to decentralize what we do a little bit and then just focus
    on value creation.
  topic: Technology/Strategy
- impact_reason: Excellent explanation of why transaction ordering (sequencing) is
    the most critical factor in DeFi profitability and fairness.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The whole ballgame is the way the transactions are ordered, which you wouldn't
    think. It's like, you know, my transaction makes it to the blockchain, I get to
    make the trade I want to make. But within a block, all these transactions that
    are included, you know, there's a large amount of value that's created or lost
    for different stakeholders based on, you know, does my FortCoin swap get in at
    the beginning of the block or at the end of the block?
  topic: DeFi/MEV
- impact_reason: 'Articulates the business case for ACE: improved user pricing, increased
    DEX volume, and enabling Solana to compete directly with specialized Layer 1s
    (like those optimized for derivatives).'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And ultimately what that means for users is like way better pricing. Um, for
    DEXes on Solana, it'll mean way more volume and then just like a way better user
    experience and hopefully that will. The goal there is to like help us rival. Other
    maybe more specialized chains.
  topic: Adoption/Strategy
- impact_reason: Directly frames the BAM plugin development as a strategic response
    to competitive pressure from specialized, high-performance derivatives platforms
    like Hyperliquid.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: this is Solana's answer to Hyperliquid, basically. You've had this upstart
    perp DEX and Layer 1 that is eating Solana's lunch on perp trading...
  topic: Investment/Competition
- impact_reason: Explicitly confirms that the new plugin architecture will enable
    Solana DEXes (like Drift) to implement sophisticated market-making advantages
    previously only possible on specialized chains (like Hyperliquid).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Hyperliquid... has these maker speed bumps where they kind of advantage the
    market maker so the market maker can quote tighter spreads without losing a bunch
    of money at a very basic level. And yeah, because of how Solana markets work today,
    that would not be possible for say Drift to do with these plugins is that now
    possible for Drift?
  topic: DeFi/Innovation
- impact_reason: This emphasizes the massive improvement in deployment speed and accessibility
    for advanced features (like transaction ordering control) compared to the previous
    method of forking clients, signaling rapid innovation potential.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: basically with BAM, like the goal is that applications can do this in a like
    transparent way, basically overnight. So if Drift or any other perp DEX, like
    I don't really care who it is, but they want to enable this, they can do it overnight.
  topic: technology/adoption
- impact_reason: 'This is a significant insight into the maturity of the chain: the
    ''free money'' (traditional MEV) is less prevalent than expected, suggesting the
    chain is becoming more efficient.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think what we thought would actually generate a lot of MEV didn't actually
    generate a lot of MEV. It's actually just like users that wanted to trade meme
    coins.
  topic: investment/market analysis
- impact_reason: 'This is a clear investment thesis: improving execution quality (tight
    spreads via plugins) leads to higher volume, higher app revenue, token buybacks,
    and ultimately, a repricing of the entire Solana ecosystem.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: if we can get super tight spreads on Solana and get a lot of volume going,
    then that will enable applications to generate a lot of fees. And hopefully they
    share those fees with the token holders. And I will see like a mass repricing
    of Solana DeFi and also Solana too.
  topic: investment/adoption
- impact_reason: Directly links US regulatory uncertainty (security classification
    fears) to suboptimal corporate/protocol revenue structures.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: a lot of the regulatory stuff in the US has kind of led to weird setups for
    revenue. People were scared to send revenue to protocols and token holders because
    they were concerned about being classified as a security.
  topic: regulation/business
- impact_reason: A powerful personal anecdote illustrating the extreme, real-world
    stress and existential threat that regulatory ambiguity poses to crypto builders
    in the US.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I've definitely lost sleep during the last administration, like thinking like,
    am I going to get in trouble or something. We thought about my wife and I actually
    talked multiple times about leaving the US.
  topic: regulation/business

    from the centralized lab entity directly to the DAO/token holders, maximizing
    alignment.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: we decided that we want to start sending all the fees that we're making at
    Gido Labs to the DAO and like there's some sub-DAO that will figure out what to
    do with that money, whether it's buybacks or, you know, whatever it is.
  topic: DeFi/business
- impact_reason: Reveals the tension between decentralized governance (DAO transparency)
    and the practical need for operational confidentiality (NDAs, sensitive business
    dealings) in running a large protocol.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There's just things that you have to do, like running a protocol that you
    can't discuss in a public forum or you can't like the counterparties that you're
    dealing with. It's like all confidential and like N and PII.
  topic: Business/Strategy
- impact_reason: A strong critique of overly granular DAO governance, arguing that
    operational efficiency requires shielding core team compensation and execution
    decisions from public debate.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We saw some of this with the Jupiter DAO like people were discussing salaries
    and like it's like we don't need to talk about that. Like, I think we hopefully
    have shown that we can like execute and create a lot of value and like I don't
    think random people need to be deciding like what the salaries are for like the
    like very good engineers and ops and all the other people that we have.
  topic: Web3 Vision/Governance
- impact_reason: 'Clearly articulates the primary criticism against the new infrastructure:
    the perceived increase in centralization risk by deepening the reliance on a single
    entity (Jito) for block scheduling.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: A lot of them revolve around Gido's centrality to Solana where it's like a
    lot of transaction flow goes through Gido and BAM is sort of expanding Gido's
    importance to the transaction ordering process or kind of how Solana blocks are
    architected.
  topic: Regulation/Centrality
- impact_reason: 'The core defense against centralization claims: relying on the open-source
    nature of the code and the voluntary adoption model, positioning it as a competitive,
    not mandatory, infrastructure layer.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Yeah. I would say that like it's open source code. It's just code and like
    there's no requirement to run this. We hope that people run it because it's good
    and like all of it will be open source. So you can look at it. If you want to
    run it, you can. If you don't, you don't have to.
  topic: Technology/Centrality
- impact_reason: Directly addresses a major pain point (MEV/sandwiching) and links
    the infrastructure upgrade to improved competitiveness against rivals.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: BAM will help Solana cut down on things like sandwich attacking and help apps
    quote tighter spreads to compete with upstart chains like Hyperliquid.
  topic: DeFi/MEV
- impact_reason: Quantifies Gido's massive centralization risk/influence, making their
    decision to open-source and decentralize BAM highly significant.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think 85% of all stake runs on Gido's Solana clients.
  topic: Infrastructure/Adoption
- impact_reason: 'The primary technical driver for BAM: current architecture cannot
    handle Solana''s projected future throughput demands.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We started to look out like how fast is Solana going to be in three years
    or four years and started to realize that the current things that we were doing,
    like the current architecture wasn't going to scale to like 2K, 5K, 10K TPS.
  topic: Technology/Scalability
- impact_reason: 'A core philosophical shift: moving away from proprietary, closed-source
    MEV infrastructure toward transparency.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We also wanted to make things more transparent to the block engines all closed
    source and we just wanted to build something that was transparent.
  topic: Strategy/Transparency
- impact_reason: A strategic pivot from pure extraction (MEV) to building features
    that directly benefit end-users and applications.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We wanted to like try to focus less on MEV and more on value creation.
  topic: Strategy/Business
- impact_reason: 'Explains the core technical mechanism of BAM: encrypted sequencing
    with verifiable code execution.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The sequencing of these transactions is happening inside of a server or inside
    of a system that is fully encrypted and you know that you can basically verify
    the code that's running.
  topic: Technology
- impact_reason: Highlights the current opacity of MEV games and promises that open-sourcing
    BAM will solve attribution issues.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It will be like fully open source so people will be able to understand what's
    going on now where today it's like it's the attribution is extremely difficult.
  topic: Transparency/MEV
- impact_reason: 'Defines the dual goal of BAM regarding MEV: prevention and immediate
    detection/exposure.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There's just a lot of games being played that are very hard to figure out
    what they are and where things are happening. And the goal here is to try to one
    prevent those games, but two, if they're happening, then it will be pretty obvious
    and you'll be able to shine a light.
  topic: MEV/Transparency
- impact_reason: Directly addresses the prevalent issue of sandwich attacks, linking
    them explicitly to manipulated transaction order flow.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And you can get into things like sandwich attacking when, you know, that order
    flow is manipulated in a way that it shouldn't be.
  topic: DeFi/Security
- impact_reason: 'Explains the core privacy mechanism: transactions are encrypted
    end-to-end until they enter the secure TEE memory, protecting them from snooping
    validators.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: it will be fully encrypted as it enters the, uh, the TEE node. So no one will
    be able to like inspect the packet and see what the contents are like, uh, this
    is a Raydium swap. And it'll essentially, once it enters in the TEE, it will sit
    there in memory. So, uh, it'll sit in the server memory. That's all encrypted.
  topic: Technology/Privacy
- impact_reason: Directly links the privacy afforded by TEEs to the mitigation of
    sandwich attacks, a major pain point for DeFi users.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The main benefits that we get from it are that the transaction contents are
    private as long as possible. So I think that will mitigate a lot of sandwiching.
  topic: DeFi/Security
- impact_reason: 'Introduces a powerful auditability feature: a verifiable log of
    transactions processed within the TEE, enhancing transparency over current opaque
    validator behavior.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The second thing is that, um, um, basically the, the system will create a
    recording of everything going on inside of it. So it will say, okay, I sent, um,
    transactions like ABC to this validator at this time. And, uh, you'll be able
    to check that recording and check the blockchain and see if there's any difference
    there.
  topic: Technology/Transparency
- impact_reason: Identifies Application Control Execution (ACE) as the next major
    frontier for Solana infrastructure, currently missing but highly desired.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: what we're still like trying to figure out right now that we need help from
    other people on is like this concept of plugins... like, you know, what? Application
    control executions are very hot topic right now and you can't really get it on
    Solana today.

  topic: DeFi/Innovation
- impact_reason: 'A concise definition of the power granted by plugins: allowing applications
    to customize internal transaction ordering logic.'

    within their app. Is that right?
  topic: Technology/DeFi
- impact_reason: Provides a concrete example of how specialized transaction ordering
    (like speed bumps) benefits market microstructure by enabling tighter spreads,
    a key DeFi innovation goal.
  relevance_score: 9

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: This Is How Solana Wins With Lucas Bruder


  This 61-minute episode features Jack Cubanek interviewing Lucas Bruder, CEO of Gido
  Labs, one of Solana''s most critical infrastructure providers. The central focus
  is the unveiling of **BAM (Block Assembly Marketplace)**, a comprehensive overhaul
  of Gido’s transaction architecture, positioned as one of the most significant infrastructure
  upgrades for Solana to date.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Solana infrastructure, transaction sequencing, MEV (Maximal
  Extractable Value) mitigation, and enhancing on-chain execution capabilities** to
  improve competitiveness against specialized chains.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **BAM Architecture and TEEs:** BAM moves transaction sequencing into **Trusted
  Execution Environments (TEEs)**, leveraging hardware encryption (present in modern
  processors like Intel/AMD and Apple devices) to ensure transaction contents remain
  private from the sequencer until execution. This is verified via hash attestations
  matching the open-source code.

  *   **Mitigating Toxic Flow and Sandwich Attacks:** By keeping transaction contents
  private within the TEE for as long as possible, BAM aims to significantly reduce
  the ability of malicious actors to observe and exploit transaction order (e.g.,
  sandwich attacks), thereby improving fairness.

  *   **Application Control Execution (ACE) via Plugins:** BAM introduces a plugin
  architecture designed to enable **Application Control Execution (ACE)**, allowing
  applications (like DEXes) to grant specific execution advantages (e.g., 10-20ms
  speed bumps for market makers) to improve quoting efficiency and liquidity provision.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Improving DEX Competitiveness:** The primary market goal of BAM is to enable
  Solana-native applications to offer pricing and execution quality competitive with
  specialized, high-performance chains like Hyperliquid, particularly in the lucrative
  perpetuals (perp) trading sector.

  *   **User Experience and Liquidity:** Successful implementation of ACE via BAM
  is expected to lead to "way better pricing" for users on Solana DEXes, driving higher
  volume and better overall user experience.

  *   **Infrastructure Centrality:** Gido has become highly central to Solana, with
  85% of stake running its clients. BAM aims to decentralize this core function while
  simultaneously improving performance and transparency.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Gido Labs (Lucas Bruder):** The core team driving the infrastructure upgrade.

  *   **Solana:** The underlying blockchain whose performance and competitiveness
  are the direct subject of the upgrade.

  *   **Hyperliquid:** Mentioned as the successful, specialized chain that Solana
  applications are currently struggling to compete against in perp trading, serving
  as a major catalyst for BAM development.

  *   **Drift:** Solana''s established perp DEX, noted as one of the initial potential
  adopters of BAM plugins to implement maker speed bumps.

  *   **Flashbots/BuilderNet:** Mentioned as an inspiration for decentralizing sequencing
  infrastructure and improving transparency, similar to Ethereum''s MEV relay architecture.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No direct regulatory discussion occurred, but the focus on **transparency** (open-sourcing
  the sequencer code) and **decentralization** of the block assembly process aligns
  with broader industry trends toward verifiable and auditable infrastructure.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where Solana can support specialized execution
  needs (like ACE for high-frequency trading) without requiring applications to fork
  to entirely new Layer 1s. If successful, BAM could solidify Solana’s position as
  a leading general-purpose smart contract platform capable of handling sophisticated
  financial applications, potentially stemming the tide of user migration to specialized
  chains.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Solana developers, infrastructure engineers,
  DeFi product managers, and crypto investors/analysts** focused on blockchain scaling
  solutions and competitive dynamics between L1s.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  Lucas Bruder of Gido Labs details the rationale and technical specifics behind **BAM
  (Block Assembly Marketplace)**, an imminent, fundamental upgrade to how transactions
  are sequenced and processed on Solana, driven by Gido’s dominant role in the network’s
  infrastructure.


  The narrative arc begins with Gido’s unexpected growth from an MEV research focus
  in 2021 to becoming the routing layer for the majority of Solana traffic, often
  due to network congestion issues. Recognizing that their existing architecture wouldn''t
  scale to Solana’s projected future throughput (2K-10K TPS), Gido decided to rebuild
  for **speed, transparency, and decentralization**.


  BAM’s core innovation lies in moving transaction sequencing into **TEEs (Trusted
  Execution Environments)**. This hardware-secured, encrypted environment ensures
  that transaction contents are private from the sequencer until they are scheduled.
  This mechanism directly addresses the problem of "toxic flow" and sandwich attacks
  by preventing malicious actors from observing transaction details prematurely. Furthermore,
  BAM will be **fully open-source**, allowing external verification of the sequencing
  logic, a significant step up from the current opaque system.


  A major strategic driver for BAM is enabling **Application Control Execution (ACE)**
  through a generic plugin system. Bruder explicitly links this capability to Solana''s
  need to compete with specialized chains like Hyperliquid, which currently dominate
  lucrative sectors like perpetuals trading due to superior execution guarantees.
  By allowing applications like Drift to implement specific speed advantages for market
  makers, BAM aims to drastically improve DEX pricing and liquidity on Solana, bringing
  execution quality closer to specialized L1s.


  While the existing Gido block engine will remain operational initially for spam
  protection, BAM represents the future architecture. The goal is to create a verifiable,
  faster, and more application-friendly sequencing layer that can retain and attract
  high-value financial activity back onto the Solana mainnet.'
