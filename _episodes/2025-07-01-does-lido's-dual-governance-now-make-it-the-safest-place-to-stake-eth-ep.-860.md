- impact_reason: This is a powerful statement suggesting Lido has achieved near-immutable
    security despite being an upgradable system, significantly boosting user trust.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think for Lido in particular, it just means that Lido, even though it's
    an upgradable smart contract system, it almost has the security of an immutable
    system in the sense that good proposals can pass, but bad proposals are now extremely
    unlikely to pass.
  topic: technology/security
- impact_reason: Claims the new mechanism sets a new high standard for security in
    upgradable smart contracts and explicitly declares Lido the 'most secure staking
    protocol.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It basically requires all the safety for us to be kind of asleep at the wheel.
    So this is now, this is almost like a filter that really raises the bar for how
    secure upgradable smart contract systems can be, and it I think it just flat out
    makes Lido the most secure staking protocol.
  topic: technology/security
- impact_reason: 'Defines the core technical innovation: creating a dynamic, context-aware
    time lock mechanism instead of a static one.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The challenge that we try to solve is how do you make a time lock that's actually
    dynamic? How do you make a time lock that is really short if the proposal is clearly
    friendly and good for the protocol, but it can be as long as necessary for everybody
    to withdraw in a very safe and relaxed manner if the proposal is deemed to be
    unfriendly?
  topic: technology/innovation
- impact_reason: 'Reiterates the main thesis: the dual governance mechanism transforms
    an upgradable system into one that behaves with the security guarantees of an
    immutable one against malicious changes.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: For LDO in particular, it just means that LDO, even though it's, it's an upgradable
    smart contract system, you know, it, it almost has the security of an immutable
    system in the sense that, you know, good proposals can pass, but bad proposals
    are extremely unlikely to pass.
  topic: technology/security
- impact_reason: 'This is a core thesis: Dual governance bridges the gap between the
    flexibility of upgradable systems and the security of immutable ones, significantly
    enhancing LDO''s security posture.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: dual governance is very exciting and kind of fundamental for for mainly two
    reasons. So, I think for LDO in particular, it just means that LDO, even though
    it's, it's an upgradable smart contract system, you know, it, it almost has the
    security of an immutable system in the sense that, you know, good proposals can
    pass, but bad proposals are extremely unlikely to pass.
  topic: Technology/Security
- impact_reason: 'This is the key value proposition: solving the fundamental trade-off
    between security/non-custodial staking and the liquidity offered by liquid staking
    derivatives.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: You always had to choose, do you want maximum security and like non-custodiality
    by directly staking? Or do you want liquidity, which requires you to opt into
    some smart contract system... And dual governance basically removes this dilemma,
    right? It just removes it. So, you had to choose between maximum security or liquidity,
    and now you can have both.
  topic: DeFi/Innovation
- impact_reason: Demonstrates long-term strategic commitment to decentralization,
    countering the narrative that Lido is only reacting to external pressure. Defines
    the ideal state of a decentralized staking middleware.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And so we have this decentralization roadmap that's going back at this point
    many years... exactly laying out, 'Here's what we will do over the next five years
    to make this protocol completely neutral, thin, permissionless, decentralized,
    secure middleware that people can just use to stake.'
  topic: strategy/adoption
- impact_reason: 'Defines the core security assumption behind dual governance: resilience
    against the compromise of one governance body (LDO holders) via the ''rage quit''
    mechanism of the other (staked ETH holders).'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We didn't do much work here because like the whole premise of making a dual
    governance is considering that there can be governance compromise. So, we kind
    of assume that like, okay, if there is a compromise of LDO holders, can staked
    ETH holders still rage quit?
  topic: technology/security
- impact_reason: 'A strong ethical/design principle: a staking protocol should not
    possess the unilateral power to seize or confiscate user stake, reinforcing the
    need for checks and balances.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's not right for the staking protocol governance to have the right to assume
    the stake, like we shouldn't do like that.
  topic: security/strategy
- impact_reason: Advocates for 'optimistic governance' to reduce governance overhead
    by moving non-consequential operational decisions off-chain or into fast-track
    mechanisms, reserving on-chain votes for major changes.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I'm generally a big proponent of the idea of optimistic governance. So, if
    you look right now in LDO, you know, even when a node operator is like rotated
    out of the node operator set, that is something that goes into an on-chain vote.
    Is that really like, you know, such a consequential decision... In my mind, the
    answer would be no, right?
  topic: technology/strategy
- impact_reason: 'Identifies the core value proposition of enhanced governance (like
    dual governance) for institutional users: the guaranteed safety mechanism (''rage
    quit'') against governance attacks.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: That's more safety for them, like institutions and people and protocols as
    hold staked ETH as collateral, they will be more safe knowing that there is always
    a way to rage quit there is a governance attack.

    relevant for regulated products like ETFs: balancing security guarantees with
    user liquidity needs.'
  relevance_score: 10

  text: And I think this bridges the gap between security and liquidity, which in
    particular I think as we are starting to speak about kind of ETP ETF-like products...
  topic: adoption/investment
- impact_reason: 'Provides a clear market thesis for the future of liquid staking
    products: success hinges on optimizing the trilemma of APY, liquidity, and meeting
    regulatory withdrawal timelines.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think this would be, you know, for between these products as Ethereum staking
    becomes unlocked, it will, you know, to a large degree, will be a competition
    between who can stake the most ETH, because you need to on the one hand optimize
    for the APY that you give to your users, and on the other hand, you need to optimize
    for liquidity when they want to withdraw because you have again regulatory-imposed
    withdrawal times that you need to service, right?

    adoption of Bitcoin, suggesting state-level entry validates and accelerates broader
    'big money' adoption.

  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: A core philosophical statement underpinning decentralized finance
    (DeFi) and user sovereignty, framing the problem dual governance aims to solve.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: As a user, you should always be in control. You should always be able to exit
    a protocol when you want to, and you shouldn't really have other people make decisions
    on you.
  topic: strategy/philosophy
- impact_reason: Clearly articulates the primary security threat (governance attack)
    that upgradable DeFi protocols face, setting the context for the solution.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The worst-case example of this is a governance attack where somebody buys
    or steals a lot of LDO and then implements a proposal that is very harmful for
    users and gets that passed due to the on-chain governance.
  topic: security/defi
- impact_reason: Frames the dual governance as a 'consumer protection mechanism,'
    which is a novel and impactful way to describe a DeFi safety feature.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Dual governance allows people to signal their displeasure by raising the temporary
    delay on the change for the tokenholder governance of Lido to de-escalate by rolling
    back the change if they see that it's not to the likes of the users. So I'd say
    that is a really powerful consumer client protection mechanism for a protocol.
  topic: regulation/adoption

    the disconnect between users (staked ETH holders) and voters (LDO holders).'
  relevance_score: 9

- impact_reason: Provides the specific, actionable thresholds (1% signal, 10% freeze)
    that define the operational mechanics of the new safety layer.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: At 1% of stake depositing into the dual governance contract, it's basically
    saying we're entering an escalation period... and then at 10%, you reach the period
    where the protocol is basically frozen and everybody can withdraw.
  topic: technology/governance
- impact_reason: 'Explains the ''RageQuit'' outcome: dissenters who signal exit are
    automatically protected from the controversial change by leaving the protocol.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If LDO holders will not roll back the change, and then it means that the stakers
    who signaled the rage quit... they are automatically, what does she say? Unstaked
    and automatically unstaked, and like they are quitting the protocol, and the changes
    don't apply to them basically.
  topic: defi/governance
- impact_reason: A bold claim positioning LDO as the industry leader in security for
    upgradable staking protocols due to this new mechanism.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So, this is now, this is almost like a filter that really raises the bar for
    how secure upgradable smart contract systems can be, and it, I think it just flat
    out makes LDO the most secure staking protocol.
  topic: Adoption/Security
- impact_reason: Elevates dual governance from a protocol feature to a foundational
    principle for future decentralized systems, emphasizing verifiable multi-stakeholder
    control.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: dual governance is not just a feature, I think it's a principle. It's the
    idea that you can have systems that are governed by multiple stakeholders in a
    cryptographically verifiable way at the same time.
  topic: Web3/Principle
- impact_reason: A powerful contrast highlighting the unique user protection offered
    by crypto governance mechanisms compared to traditional Web2 services.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: there are no companies out there in Web2 where as a user, you have a cryptographic
    guarantee that they can't just raise the fees on you, for example, or that they
    can't start selling your data, or, you know, that they can't in any way like change
    the terms on you in a way that you don't agree to.
  topic: Web3/Adoption
- impact_reason: Predicts that as DeFi matures, governance risk management will become
    a primary concern for sophisticated entities like institutions and even nation-states.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: institutional users, and extremely security-conscious users, say eventually
    I think in nation-states and stuff like that, they will put a lot of effort into
    risk management, and this includes risk management on the governance risk as well.
  topic: Regulation/Investment
- impact_reason: A strong warning about the escalating threat of cyberattacks, particularly
    with the advent of AI, making robust safeguards like dual governance a necessity,
    not a luxury.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: cyberattacks are changing higher every year, like more and more and more harm
    is done by them, so this trend is not stopping, and I think with AI attackers
    it will just like continue to go higher, so we will have just more attacks and
    more harm done by them, and that will make people consider the safeguards and
    the risk mitigation small.
  topic: Technology/Security
- impact_reason: 'Explains the critical design constraint for smart contract governance:
    the absolute necessity of avoiding deadlocks, which is a unique challenge compared
    to real-world political systems.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: You can't have this on the smart contract level, and like you can't really
    rely on, like expect people to be up in arms about the staking protocol. So, you
    can't replicate that. You need to design something that can't have any deadlocks
    at all because deadlocks in smart contracts is just meaning the protocols to walk
    in and like everyone isn't happy.
  topic: Technology/Design
- impact_reason: Strongly refutes the narrative that Lido is reactive, pointing to
    a multi-year, proactive strategic plan for building decentralized infrastructure.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: They think, you know, 'Oh, Lido is maybe reacting in response to, you know,
    because Lido got so big and there's public pressure put on us.' And like the reality
    is you can literally go back to like radar block and it's there like three, four
    years ago exactly laying out, 'Here's what we will do over the next five years
    to make this protocol completely neutral, thin, permissionless, decentralized,
    secure middleware...'
  topic: Strategy/Business

    securing and decentralizing the protocol's future decision-making process.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And I see dual governance as a major, major building block in this journey.
  topic: technology/strategy
- impact_reason: Provides a strong counter-argument to the concern that reducing LDO's
    unilateral power diminishes its value. Argues value comes from durability and
    security.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Will this make LDO in some way less valuable? And I think for me, it's clear
    no. I think it's quite the opposite because the value of LDO doesn't come from
    the ability to make negative proposals and still money.
  topic: investment/strategy
- impact_reason: Connects improved security/decentralization (via dual governance)
    directly to increased adoption by attracting users previously deterred by trust
    assumptions.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The second side is now that the trust required from a staker to use LDO is
    also much lower. And so, to the degree that this converts to more usage, more
    people using LDO because they really value the security and the decentralization,
    maybe folks who were previously only using direct staking...
  topic: adoption/business
- impact_reason: Identifies governance risk as a primary hurdle for institutional
    and sophisticated staker adoption, validating the need for mechanisms like dual
    governance.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's one of the main questions you hear when you talk with some stakers that
    choosing between different staking providers, like, 'What happens if governance
    is compromised? Like, what's your risk management practices? Like, what happens
    if like Lido goes rogue?'
  topic: adoption/regulation
- impact_reason: Draws a direct analogy between the proposed governance structure
    and the fundamental mechanism of Optimistic Rollups, linking DAO efficiency to
    L2 scaling concepts.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's also what for example, your optimistic rollups are based on, you know,
    just the idea of, you know, it just happens, and then there's a waiting period,
    and if nobody objects, then it becomes finalized.
  topic: technology/strategy
- impact_reason: 'Explains a key technical limitation preventing wrapped ETH (like
    wETH) from participating in governance: the immutability of non-upgradable contracts
    makes custom voting integration impossible without protocol-level changes.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Wrapped versions of ETH is not an upgradable contract, and the ability to
    vote with staked ETH in this contract cannot be implemented by token upgrade.
    Implementing a custom voting system for every place that holds staked ETH is out
    of the question.
  topic: technology/defi
- impact_reason: Highlights the necessity of robust governance mechanisms like dual
    governance to safeguard protocols against malicious actors, contrasting it with
    simpler, 'optimistic' governance tracks.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think that they begin more of the size of dual governance have a general
    protocol, you need to go in through that process, like the full process of token
    holder voting, but in general, yes, a lot of things, especially with safeguards
    such as dual governance and other ways of like safeguarding against the bad actors,
    to go through the optimistic governance processes like easy track voting and Lido
    and stuff.
  topic: technology/governance
- impact_reason: 'A crucial insight into institutional DeFi adoption: security demands
    are driven both by internal risk management and increasingly strict regulatory
    oversight for large capital holders.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think the largest investors have the highest demands in terms of security
    sometimes from their own accord, sometimes imposed by regulation, which gets more
    strict and onerous, you know, the higher you go up the food chain in terms of
    institutional capital.
  topic: regulation/investment
- impact_reason: Argues that enhanced security (via dual governance) is not just a
    feature, but a competitive advantage that strengthens the existing market leadership
    based on liquidity.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And so I think dual governance really helps make, you know, by adding this
    layer of security that previously didn't exist, it really amplifies the benefit
    of the liquidity that Lido already has and where it's the market leader and kind
    of brings that more into play.

  topic: DeFi/Governance
- impact_reason: Suggests the concept of dual governance could become a standard design
    pattern across various decentralized applications, not just Lido.

  text: my hope is that dual governance is just a term that we use kind of colloquially
    in crypto and eventually beyond to describe many things that, you know, give users
    power over the services that they use.

- impact_reason: Directly addresses institutional adoption, suggesting enhanced security
    and governance features are key to attracting larger, risk-averse players.

    thing to do to give the stakers means to not be at the whims of the governance
    of the protocol, they don't have to like to trust fully, they only have to trust
    that the code is right, basically.
  topic: Strategy/Philosophy
- impact_reason: Identifies a specific attack vector (hostile takeover via large stake
    accumulation) that the dual governance design specifically mitigates by preventing
    wholesale dismantling.

  text: The other vector of of harm to to Lido to users that is possible is an outside
    actor staking some amount of at the end of the protocol, like a lot, for example,
    and then using it to harm the protocol if the protocol allows it. So, if the protocol
    would allow to dismantle the dual governance, allow to dismantle the protocol
    wholesale, it would be very vulnerable to outside actors.

    years by this point... And so when Lido started out, it wasn't, we were so early
    to staking. It wasn't even possible to control a validator on the consensus layer
    with a smart contract on the execution layer.

- impact_reason: Details the ongoing commitment to decentralization by making the
    protocol permissionless for node operators, not just end-users.

    Technology, DVT, to make staking permissionless in Lido, you know, not just, so
    it's not only permissionless for users, but it's increasingly also permissionless
    for node operators.

    risk...

  text: What they can do is to trigger the rage quit beyond stakes for the protocol,
    and that's it. That's what they can do. And they have an opportunity cost for
    that.

  text: I wouldn't say, you know, this is necessarily such a bad sign because if yes,
    the quorum is 5%, but then like once 5% is reached, what's your incentive? What's
    the incentive for someone to vote whose vote will not in any way like influence
    the result anymore, right?

    delay the launch of dual governance by like three months or something.

    higher yields without compromising on risk metrics, directly benefiting end-users.'

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Does Lido''s Dual Governance Now Make It the Safest
  Place to Stake ETH? - Ep. 860


  This episode of Unchained features **Hasu** (Strategic Advisor at Lido and Strategy
  Lead at Flashbots) and **Vasilie Shabalov** (Co-founder of Lido) discussing the
  recent implementation of Lido’s **Dual Governance** mechanism, which fundamentally
  alters its upgradeability and security posture.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **Lido staking protocol''s governance overhaul**, specifically
  the introduction of Dual Governance as a dynamic time-lock mechanism designed to
  protect staked ETH holders (stETH users) from potentially harmful governance changes
  enacted by LDO token holders. The discussion centers on solving the principal-agent
  problem in upgradable DeFi protocols.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Dynamic Time Lock Mechanism:** Dual Governance functions as a dynamic time
  lock, unlike static time locks which require impractically long durations for Lido
  due to withdrawal times. It starts with a short default delay but extends based
  on user signaling.

  *   **Two-Threshold Escalation:** The system uses two critical thresholds based
  on staked ETH deposited into the Dual Governance contract: **1% signals an escalation
  period** (minimum 5-day delay), and **10% triggers a freeze** (maximum 45-day delay),
  during which no governance proposals can pass, allowing all users to safely withdraw.

  *   **Rage Quit Protection:** If LDO holders refuse to roll back a contentious proposal
  after the freeze, dissenting stakers who signaled their dissent are automatically
  unstaked and exit the protocol, protected from the change.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Security Premium:** Dual Governance effectively removes the traditional trade-off
  between liquidity (offered by Lido) and maximum security (offered by non-custodial,
  immutable staking). This positions Lido as potentially the **most secure staking
  protocol**, even though it remains upgradable.

  *   **Institutional Appeal:** The enhanced security guarantees and robust governance
  risk mitigation are expected to make Lido significantly more appealing to institutional
  participants and security-conscious entities.

  *   **Decentralization Roadmap Fulfillment:** This implementation is framed as a
  major step in Lido’s multi-year decentralization roadmap, moving the protocol toward
  being a neutral, thin, and secure middleware layer.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Lido:** The protocol implementing the Dual Governance system.

  *   **Hasu & Vasilie Shabalov:** Guests providing deep insight into the design rationale
  and technical implementation.

  *   **Flashbots:** Mentioned in relation to Hasu’s role, highlighting expertise
  in MEV and secure transaction ordering, relevant to governance security.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  While not a direct regulatory discussion, the conversation touches on the **governance
  risk** that major protocols face. The speakers note that as DeFi matures and attracts
  larger capital (including potentially nation-states), the scrutiny on governance
  safeguards will increase, making Lido''s proactive approach a necessary risk management
  measure against evolving cyber threats.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The speakers believe Dual Governance is more than just a feature; it''s a **principle**
  that could be adopted widely across Web3. They hope the term will become colloquial
  for any system offering cryptographically verifiable power to users over the services
  they use, preventing unilateral changes like fee hikes or terms modification seen
  in Web2. This mechanism is seen as essential for protocols handling massive value
  in an era of increasing cyberattacks.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **DeFi professionals, protocol developers, LDO
  token holders, institutional investors** looking at staking solutions, and anyone
  interested in advanced decentralized governance design and risk management frameworks
  within Web3.'
