summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: New Token Launch? Use These Pro Tips to Win
  Early


  This 21-minute podcast episode, hosted by Nick from Coin Bureau, provides an educational
  breakdown of a report by Erakus Finance analyzing the performance of major token
  launches in the first half of 2025. The central theme is identifying the patterns
  that separated successful token launches from those that "face-planted," offering
  listeners a framework to navigate future Token Generation Events (TGEs).


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion is squarely focused on **Crypto/Web3**, specifically analyzing the
  **Tokenomics, market dynamics, and early trading performance of newly launched tokens**
  (TGEs) to derive actionable investment insights.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Early Relative Strength (BTC Terms):** The most reliable early indicator is
  a token''s performance relative to Bitcoin (BTC) in the first few weeks; tokens
  that outperform BTC early tend to maintain momentum, while those that lag rarely
  recover.

  *   **Supply Overhang and Valuation Gaps:** High initial Fully Diluted Valuations
  (FDV) driven by massive premiums over private sale prices create immediate supply
  overhang, punishing tokens where retail investors feel they are simply "exit liquidity."

  *   **Circulating Supply Nuance:** Contrary to past sentiment, the study suggests
  that a low initial circulating supply (under 20% float) can be bullish *if* paired
  with a conservative launch valuation and a sensible vesting schedule, preventing
  immediate selling stampedes.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Skepticism Towards Hype:** Six out of ten highly hyped, large-cap launches
  studied ended below their launch price, proving that blue-chip optics and prominent
  backers do not guarantee success.

  *   **Market Timing vs. Product:** Launching immediately following a significant
  Bitcoin rally (e.g., 20%+ run) often leads to token "hangovers" due to market exhaustion;
  launches during sideways BTC action often fare better initially.

  *   **Volume as a Health Metric:** A sharp drop-off in trading volume within the
  first month post-launch is a strong negative signal, often preceding significant
  price declines, indicating fading interest.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Erakus Finance:** The source of the underlying research report, "Why Your
  TGE Will Probably Fail: Lessons from H1 2025''s Top Token Launches."

  *   **Successful Tokens Mentioned:** IP (Story Protocol), WCT (WalletConnect''s
  token), Init (INIT), and Kaito (notable exception that overcame high premiums due
  to strong AI narrative/product-market fit).

  *   **Underperforming Tokens Mentioned:** Berachain (Bearer token), which suffered
  the worst performance (74% loss) despite massive hype, largely due to a high public
  premium.

  *   **Axiom:** Mentioned as a trading terminal solution to streamline the complex
  data monitoring required for new token launches (liquidity, supply, holder concentration).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No direct regulatory or policy discussion was featured; the focus remained strictly
  on market mechanics, tokenomics, and trading strategy.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that the market is maturing beyond the speculative frenzy
  of 2021. Future success for new tokens will depend less on pure hype or investor
  pedigree and more on **demonstrable product-market fit, disciplined token distribution,
  and favorable macro timing relative to Bitcoin''s cycle.** Investors must conduct
  deeper due diligence on tokenomics documents rather than relying on marketing.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This content is highly valuable for **Crypto/Web3 professional traders, DeFi participants,
  and serious retail investors** who actively participate in or monitor new token
  launches and initial DEX offerings (IDOs/TGEs).

  ### Comprehensive Summary Narrative


  The episode dissects the factors determining success or failure in recent major
  token launches, using the Erakus Finance report as a foundation. The core narrative
  establishes that despite high initial valuations and blue-chip backing, the majority
  of hyped 2025 launches failed to maintain their opening price.


  The discussion pinpoints three primary reasons for failure: **rapid liquidity drying
  up**, **price sticker shock** stemming from excessive premiums over private sale
  prices, and **reflexive sentiment loops** where early price action dictates future
  momentum.


  The most actionable insight derived is the importance of **early relative strength
  against Bitcoin**. Tokens that show immediate momentum against the market tide are
  far more likely to succeed, suggesting momentum is a self-fulfilling prophecy in
  crypto trading.


  The analysis then delves into specific tokenomic pitfalls. The gap between private
  and public sale prices is crucial; tokens like Berachain, which launched at a 1,200%+
  premium, were punished severely, whereas those with modest markups (like IP) succeeded.
  Conversely, the study found that a low initial circulating supply is not inherently
  negative if the vesting schedule is transparent and reasonable. Airdrop size showed
  no clear correlation with success, emphasizing that **expectation management** among
  claimants is key.


  Finally, the episode integrates **macro timing**, stressing that launching immediately
  after a major Bitcoin rally often results in a "hangover" effect for the new token.
  The ideal scenario identified is a token launching when Bitcoin is trading sideways,
  offering a cleaner runway for price discovery, provided the token itself demonstrates
  early relative strength and maintains trading volume. The overall takeaway is a
  strong caution against relying on hype; success hinges on analyzing transparent
  tokenomics, monitoring early momentum against BTC, and assessing market appetite
  post-Bitcoin moves.'
