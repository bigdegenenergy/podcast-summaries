    could think of it as a reward. Right. But it's a very dense reward where you're

    offers a safer, more iterative path for capability improvement.

    figuring out basic mechanics of the world. And then there's this spike up as they
    learn to exploit the easy rewards. And then it's almost like a seed word in some
    respects. And then it continues on indefinitely as it just learns to absolutely
    maximize the game.
  topic: technical

    from models while humans heavily rely on imitation/demonstration (scaffolding)
    for new, complex tasks.'
  relevance_score: 7
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We take for granted how much we need to show humans how to do specific tasks.
    And there's a failure to generalize here. Like if I were to just suddenly give
    you a new software platform... you'd immediately want to go online and watch a
    demo of someone else doing it in order to then be able to imitate that.

    envelope. And so what that means is that the, but do what's in the envelope. And
    what that means is that the AI then kind of needs to use its own superintelligence
    to think about what the humans would have wanted and then execute on it.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Is RL + LLMs Enough for AGI? â€” Sholto Douglas & Trenton
  Bricken


  This 144-minute episode features Sholto Douglas and Trenton Bricken (both now at
  Anthropic) revisiting their predictions from the previous year (2024) to assess
  the progress made in combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Large Language Models
  (LLMs) toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the convergence of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Large
  Language Models (LLMs)**, specifically examining how RL, particularly RL from verifiable
  rewards, is unlocking expert-level performance in complex domains. Key areas discussed
  include the development of **agentic behavior**, the challenges of **long time-horizon
  tasks**, and the comparison between domains that are easily verifiable (like competitive
  programming and software engineering) versus those requiring subjective judgment
  (like creative writing).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **RL Success in Verifiable Domains:** The biggest change in the past year is
  the conclusive demonstration that RL can push LLMs to expert, human-level reliability,
  particularly in domains with clean, verifiable reward signals (e.g., passing unit
  tests in software engineering or solving math problems).

  *   **Limitation Shift from Reliability to Context/Scope:** The primary bottleneck
  for agents is no longer just the "extra nines of reliability" (as previously thought),
  but rather the **lack of context, memory systems, and the ability to handle complex,
  multi-file changes or long-horizon discovery tasks.**

  *   **RL vs. Pre-training Compute Allocation:** There is a current imbalance where
  labs spend vastly more compute on base model pre-training than on subsequent RL
  fine-tuning. The speakers argue that RL is a crucial area for adding new knowledge
  and capabilities, suggesting compute allocation in RL will rapidly increase as algorithms
  mature.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Software Engineering Agents Maturing:** The speakers predict that by the end
  of the next year (2026), competent software engineering agents capable of performing
  a junior engineer''s day''s work will be commonplace, driven by the inherent verifiability
  of code tasks.

  *   **Verifiability Dictates Acceleration:** Domains with objective success metrics
  (like scientific discovery leading to patents, as exemplified by a drug discovery
  case) will see faster AI acceleration than subjective creative fields (like Pulitzer-winning
  novels).

  *   **Compute vs. Scaffolding Trade-off:** Companies are currently optimizing the
  trade-off between spending compute (letting the model "hit the typewriter" until
  it succeeds) versus spending dollars on human time to create bespoke, scaffolded
  training environments (curricula) for specific skills.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Anthropic:** Both speakers are now affiliated with Anthropic.

  *   **OpenAI (GPT-4/O3):** Mentioned regarding their 10x compute multiplier increase
  from O1 to O3, indicating scaling RL compute post-initial release.

  *   **DeepMind/AlphaGo:** Used as a historical example of RL teaching agents new
  knowledge beyond human performance, provided sufficient compute and a clean signal.

  *   **Future House (Sam Rodriguez):** Mentioned for using LLMs to brainstorm and
  propose wet lab experiments that led to the discovery of a new drug.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a near-term future where **agentic software engineering**
  becomes a reality, driven by clean feedback loops. The long-term path to AGI hinges
  on solving the **long time-horizon problem** and developing more general procedures
  for skill acquisition, rather than relying solely on bespoke, heavily scaffolded
  environments for every new task. The speakers also touch upon the possibility that
  current models are still **under-parameterized** relative to the human brain, limiting
  their ability to generalize efficiently.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI researchers, ML engineers, AI product managers,
  and technology investors** interested in the practical roadmap for scaling LLMs
  into autonomous agents and the technical bottlenecks currently facing the industry.'
