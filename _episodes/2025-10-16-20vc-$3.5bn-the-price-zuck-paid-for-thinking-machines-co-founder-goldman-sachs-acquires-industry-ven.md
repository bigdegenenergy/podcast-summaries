summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Valuation, Loyalty, and Strategic Moves in Tech
  & VC


  This episode of the 20VC podcast, featuring Harry Stebbings alongside guests Jason
  Lampkin and Rory O''Driscoll, dives deep into several high-profile transactions
  and underlying cultural shifts within the venture capital and technology ecosystem.
  The conversation spans the valuation of asset management businesses, the perceived
  erosion of founder loyalty, and major strategic moves by industry giants like SoftBank
  and Goldman Sachs.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus areas are **Venture Capital Strategy and Economics**, **Asset
  Management M&A**, and **Founder/Employee Loyalty in the Age of Hyper-Valuation**.
  While not explicitly crypto/Web3, the discussion heavily involves capital allocation,
  high-stakes financing, and the mechanics of wealth creation in tech.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Asset Manager Valuation Multiples:** The discussion established that asset
  management businesses are valued differently based on their model. Primary VC firms
  (like Roger''s new fund) are often valued based on the "IQ of the stock picker"
  and are not easily monetizable/sellable (low multiple). In contrast, productizable
  businesses like secondary/fund-of-funds managers (like Industry Ventures) can command
  higher multiples, trading at roughly **10% of AUM** (similar to Carlyle/KKR) or
  **10x revenue** for a solid business with high fees.

  *   **Acqui-Hires at Scale:** The departure of Andrew Tulloch from Thinking Machines
  to Matter is framed as an extreme example of an "asset purchase" or "acqui-hire,"
  where the value is in the talent/people rather than traditional product integration,
  even at multi-billion dollar valuations.

  *   **VC Business Structure vs. Monetization:** A key distinction was made between
  firms built around a few partners'' proprietary deal flow (non-monetizable) versus
  firms built around scalable platforms, brands, or institutional processes (highly
  monetizable, e.g., Y Combinator, large asset gatherers).


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Goldman Sachsâ€™ Private Asset Push:** The acquisition of Industry Ventures
  ($665M base + earn-out) is seen as a strategic move by Goldman Sachs to rapidly
  scale its private asset platform (Apex) for HNW clients, capitalizing on the high
  fees associated with private capital compared to eroding public market management
  fees.

  *   **SoftBankâ€™s AI Bet:** SoftBank reportedly borrowed **$5 billion against its
  ARM holding** specifically to increase investment exposure to OpenAI, signaling
  an aggressive, leveraged capital deployment strategy focused on securing positions
  in top-tier AI infrastructure.

  *   **The "Hunger" Paradox for VCs:** A recurring theme is the LP skepticism post-success:
  once a fund manager achieves massive DPI (Distributions to Paid-In Capital), LPs
  question their future "hunger" or motivation, creating a difficult dynamic for successful
  founders/investors.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Industry Ventures (Hans S):** Acquired by Goldman Sachs. Praised for building
  a successful, productizable secondary/fund-of-funds business over 25 years.

  *   **Thinking Machines & Matter:** The focus of the loyalty debate. Andrew Tulloch
  left the $2B-backed Thinking Machines (post-money valuation ~$10B) to join Matter,
  which recently raised $20M from Excel at a reported $3.5B valuation.

  *   **SoftBank & OpenAI:** Highlighted for SoftBank''s leveraged maneuver to increase
  its stake in OpenAI.

  *   **Arthur Rock:** Mentioned as an OG West Coast VC (Intel investor), serving
  as a benchmark for direct, intimidating, and highly respected investing wisdom.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No specific regulatory discussions were highlighted. The focus remained on internal
  market dynamics, deal structures, and founder incentives.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests an industry moving toward **increased transactionalism**
  where relationships are secondary to the highest price, particularly among founders
  receiving massive paper wealth early on. Investors must adapt by tightening **founder
  vesting terms** (longer cliffs, repurchase rights) to mitigate the risk of co-founders
  "checking out" when offered life-changing liquidity events. Furthermore, the trend
  of large institutions aggressively acquiring specialized asset managers to gain
  access to private markets will likely continue.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Venture Capital Professionals (GPs and LPs),
  Fund Managers, and experienced Technology Founders** interested in the economics
  of the VC industry, M&A trends in asset management, and the evolving ethics of founder
  commitment.'
