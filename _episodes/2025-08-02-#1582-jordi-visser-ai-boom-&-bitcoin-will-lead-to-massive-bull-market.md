summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #1582 Jordi Visser | AI Boom & Bitcoin Will
  Lead To MASSIVE Bull Market


  This episode of the Pom Podcast features Anthony Pompliano in conversation with
  Jordi Visser, a 30-year veteran of Wall Street, focusing on the confluence of the
  AI boom, macroeconomic shifts (specifically Federal Reserve policy), and the bullish
  outlook for Bitcoin.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on three primary, interconnected areas:

  1. **Macroeconomics & Monetary Policy:** Analysis of recent weak jobs data revisions,
  the expectation of imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, and the historical
  impact of cutting rates into a non-recessionary environment.

  2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Revolution:** Deep dive into the exponential growth
  driven by AI, particularly the concept of "recursive learning" (code learning from
  code), and its profound impact on corporate earnings and productivity.

  3. **Bitcoin & Asset Markets:** The prediction that the combination of Fed easing
  and the AI-driven productivity explosion will fuel a massive bull market, with Bitcoin
  positioned as a primary beneficiary.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  * **Recursive Learning & Exponential Productivity:** The most critical technical
  insight is the acceleration driven by AI agents creating new AI agents ("code learning
  from code"). This is framed as an exponential hiring event, allowing companies to
  scale productivity (and potentially profit margins) without commensurate linear
  labor costs.

  * **Data Center & Infrastructure Bottlenecks:** Despite massive revenue beats from
  cloud providers (Mag Seven), significant supply chain bottlenecks exist in necessary
  infrastructure, including gas turbines, transformers, and cooling systems, which
  currently limit the *speed* of the AI build-out.

  * **AI Adoption Phase:** The massive cloud revenue growth signals a shift from the
  infrastructure build-out phase (dominated by chipmakers like Nvidia) into the AI
  adoption phase, where service-based companies (finance, healthcare) will begin seeing
  significant profit margin improvements from AI integration.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  * **Bullish Fed Cut Scenario:** Visser argues that the market is correctly pricing
  in a Fed cut, and if the Fed cuts rates into an economy that is merely "okay" (or
  accelerating due to AI investment), "stocks usually do phenomenally well."

  * **AI Earnings Substantiate Valuations:** The staggering revenue beats from the
  Mag Seven ($18 billion combined beat vs. the S&P 500 #400 market cap) prove that
  the AI trade is based on fundamental substance, not just froth, justifying current
  high valuations.

  * **Bitcoin Outperformance:** The expectation of lower rates, combined with the
  massive productivity gains from AI, creates a combustible environment for risk assets,
  strongly favoring Bitcoin, which has historically outperformed during similar monetary
  easing cycles.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  * **Mag Seven (Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple, Microsoft):** Highlighted for their
  massive earnings beats, driven primarily by cloud revenue, signaling the core of
  the current economic distortion caused by AI investment.

  * **Nvidia (Jensen Huang):** Mentioned regarding the justification for massive AI
  engineer salaries, framing talent acquisition as a necessary CapEx component for
  winning the AGI race.

  * **MicroStrategy:** Cited as an example of a company whose stock performance is
  now overwhelmingly driven by its Bitcoin holdings rather than traditional earnings
  metrics.

  * **Peter Diamandis (Moonshots Podcast):** Recommended for listeners seeking deeper
  context on the historic nature and proximity to Artificial General Intelligence
  (AGI).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  * **Political Support for AI Race:** The conversation noted that the current political
  environment (specifically referencing the Trump administration''s stated goals)
  is actively supporting the AI race by fast-tracking permits for energy and data
  center infrastructure and providing favorable tax treatment for CapEx accounting.

  * **Dodd-Frank Impact:** Visser noted that regulatory constraints (like Dodd-Frank)
  have effectively frozen government hiring, contributing to the weakness seen outside
  of subsidized sectors like leisure and healthcare in the jobs report.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is heading toward a period of **unprecedented,
  non-linear productivity growth** driven by recursive AI learning. This will lead
  to exploding profit margins for companies that successfully adopt AI, fundamentally
  changing how Wall Street analysts model growth. The combination of this productivity
  boom and dovish monetary policy sets the stage for a **massive, sustained bull market**
  across risk assets, led by technology and Bitcoin. The primary near-term risk is
  the physical bottleneck in energy and hardware supply needed to sustain the build-out.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **institutional investors, hedge fund managers,
  technology strategists, and sophisticated crypto investors** who need to synthesize
  macroeconomic forecasts with deep technological shifts (AI) to inform high-conviction
  investment theses.'
