    them as systemic manipulation rather than organic market management.

  text: So is value investing about a certain sector? Is value investing about a certain
    way of evaluating a company and buying it for less than it's worth, right? I would

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Bitcoin’s $10K Candles Are Coming — Get Ready | Anthony
  & John Pompliano


  This 50-minute episode of The Pomp Podcast, featuring Anthony Pompliano and John
  Pompliano, dives deep into recent market volatility, the resilience of the stock
  market, the evolving nature of Bitcoin as an asset, and the overarching influence
  of central bank policy on asset valuations.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus areas were **Cryptocurrency Markets (specifically Bitcoin)**,
  **Traditional Equity Markets (Stock Market)**, and **Macroeconomic Policy/Geopolitics**
  and their interaction with asset prices.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin Liquidity Clearing:** The recent massive liquidation event ($19 billion)
  served to "wipe out all the excess leverage" in the crypto market, which is viewed
  as a necessary prerequisite for the market to move higher sustainably.

  *   **24/7 Market Advantage:** Geopolitical events occurring outside of traditional
  stock market hours (like the Friday/Sunday timeframe discussed) highlight Bitcoin’s
  24/7 trading nature, attracting users who seek immediate liquidity and trading access
  when other markets are closed.

  *   **Dollar vs. Percentage Volatility:** The vernacular around Bitcoin is shifting
  from focusing on absolute dollar movements (e.g., "$2,000 move") to percentage moves,
  even though the aggregate dollar amount of daily moves is increasing (predicting
  $15k–$20k daily swings), which will eventually normalize as a small percentage move
  for a larger asset.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Retail "Buy the Dip" Reflexivity:** The current generation of retail investors
  exhibits a strong understanding of reflexivity, viewing rapid dips as buying opportunities,
  which contributes to the market''s quick recovery post-volatility.

  *   **Bull Market Longevity:** Based on historical averages (7-8 years), the current
  bull market (three years in) still has significant runway, supported by the fact
  that major pessimists (like Howard Marks) are not calling for a crash.

  *   **Asset Valuation Justification:** Current high valuations are justified because
  companies are delivering impressive results and guidance, often achieving higher
  future profits faster and with greater efficiency (e.g., higher revenue per employee,
  as seen with Palantir), unlike previous speculative bubbles.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump:** Mentioned for his perceived ability to use social media and
  timing announcements (e.g., tariffs) to manipulate market sentiment and geopolitical
  negotiations.

  *   **Howard Marks (Oaktree):** Cited as a respected value investor who is currently
  *not* predicting a market crash, suggesting valuations are not yet at bubble territory.

  *   **Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase):** Referenced as part of the consensus among
  major financial figures acknowledging the current bull market status.

  *   **Palantir:** Used as a prime example of a modern, efficient company achieving
  high growth while simultaneously reducing headcount, signaling a shift toward productivity-focused
  valuation.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Fed Playbook:** The core policy discussion centers on the Federal Reserve''s
  established playbook: they will *not* allow prolonged bear markets (18+ months)
  or deep recessions. They are expected to deploy massive monetary stimulus ("monetary
  bazooka") to prevent significant asset price deflation, even at the cost of dollar
  purchasing power.

  *   **Market Manipulation via Rules:** Traditional stock markets are seen as being
  manipulated by operational rules like circuit breakers and set hours of operation,
  whereas Bitcoin operates as a "pure market" determined more by spot buyers.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  Bitcoin is currently in its **"teenage years"** of maturity. It is more mature than
  before but has not yet reached the status of an "adult" asset class (projected to
  happen around a $10 trillion market cap) where institutions and central banks fully
  commit. The trend toward efficiency, lower employee counts, and higher revenue per
  employee will continue to drive higher multiples for successful companies.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Active Crypto Investors, Institutional Investors,
  and Financial Professionals** interested in macro trends, asset valuation methodologies,
  and the interplay between geopolitical events and market mechanics.'
