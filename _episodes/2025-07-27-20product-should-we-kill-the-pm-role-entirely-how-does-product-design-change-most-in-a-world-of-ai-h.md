summary: '## Podcast Summary: 20Product - Should We Kill the PM Role Entirely? (with
  Fernando Fanton)


  This 67-minute episode of 20 Product features Fernando Fanton, CPO at Property Finder
  and former CPO at Monzo and Just Eat, discussing product leadership, the impact
  of AI on product development, and the enduring nature of the Product Manager role.
  The conversation is framed by Fanton’s personal philosophy, heavily influenced by
  his early dedication to competitive tennis.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Product Leadership & Strategy**, with significant tangents
  into **Personal Philosophy (Discipline, Resilience)**, the **Impact of Generative
  AI on Product Development & Engineering**, and the **Evolution of Product Teams
  (specifically the PM role)**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **AI-Accelerated Prototyping:** AI tools (like Lovable or those from Y Combinator)
  are drastically reducing the time to create meaningful prototypes, allowing teams
  to test concepts with users in a single day, bypassing traditional, slow mockup
  stages.

  *   **Code Quality in AI Output:** The next hurdle for AI prototyping tools is ensuring
  the generated code output is clean enough for engineers to easily "reverse engineer"
  into production-ready features, rather than just serving as a design concept.

  *   **Automation of Mundane Tasks:** Repetitive engineering tasks (like boilerplate
  code or unit testing) are being eliminated by AI, leading to a shift where fewer
  engineers might be needed for mundane work, but the remaining engineers will focus
  on higher-impact, abstract problem-solving.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **The "Crap Product" Problem:** Most products suck because companies lack the
  capital, the team, or, most commonly, the sustained *care* to continuously improve
  them beyond the initial launch. Great products require constant iteration ("It''s
  never good enough").

  *   **In-Housing vs. SaaS:** The idea that companies will stop buying valuable,
  non-core SaaS tools to build everything internally is dismissed. Maintaining numerous
  internal products becomes an unsustainable maintenance burden.

  *   **Founder DNA vs. Scale:** Companies starting out need "crazy" founder energy
  to defy reality, but as they scale, they often require more risk-averse leaders
  focused on steady improvement and protecting established value.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Fernando Fanton:** The interviewee, highlighting his experience at **Monzo,
  Just Eat, Rappi, and Property Finder**.

  *   **Roger Federer:** Used as an analogy for the mental discipline required for
  elite performance.

  *   **Microsoft:** Referenced as a past employer where Fanton learned about the
  balance between creative thinking and analytical execution (the "chess and guitar"
  analogy for PMs).

  *   **Nothing (Phone):** Mentioned as a recent example of a company showing renewed
  care and design innovation in a mature market (smartphones).


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward **hyper-productivity**, where smaller, highly cross-functional
  teams can achieve significantly more output due to AI tooling. This necessitates
  a shift in skillsets across the board, demanding more creativity and analytical
  depth from every role, including product and engineering.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Senior Product Leaders (VPs, CPOs), Engineering
  Managers, and Founders** interested in scaling teams, navigating the integration
  of AI into the development lifecycle, and understanding the evolving definition
  of product excellence.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast episode features an in-depth conversation with Fernando Fanton, a highly
  respected European product executive, covering product philosophy, personal resilience,
  and the future of product teams amidst rapid technological change.


  The narrative begins with Fanton drawing parallels between his intense early career
  in competitive tennis and the discipline required in product leadership. He emphasizes
  that **mental fortitude, the ability to hit a wall and rise above it, and relentless
  self-improvement** are more critical than innate talent—a mindset he believes drives
  elite performers like Federer and Jordan. He strongly critiques the concept of rigid
  "visions," arguing they constrain potential; instead, he advocates for a daily cadence
  of improvement that compounds over time.


  The discussion pivots to the challenges of building great products. Fanton asserts
  that **most products fail not due to lack of capital, but a lack of sustained care
  and commitment to continuous improvement.** He uses the example of the Nothing phone
  disrupting the mature smartphone market to illustrate that "good enough" is a negative
  concept; superior solutions demand constant iteration.


  A major theme is the **impact of AI on product development**. Fanton notes that
  AI tools are democratizing prototyping, allowing teams to test concepts in days
  rather than weeks, effectively solving the initial hurdle of getting something meaningful
  in front of users. However, this introduces a new challenge: ensuring the AI''s
  code output is compatible with internal engineering standards. This acceleration
  is forcing designers to focus less on static mockups and more on anchoring the team
  to the core mission.


  Crucially, the conversation addresses the **future of the Product Manager role**.
  Fanton firmly rejects the notion that the PM function is dying. Instead, he predicts
  teams will become smaller and more cross-functional. The PM’s role is evolving from
  backlog management (a perceived European trait) to being the **"connective fabric"**—the
  creative and analytical nexus (like playing chess and guitar) that elevates the
  team''s overall creativity and strategic thinking, even as engineers become more
  capable of handling technical execution. He concludes that while the sheer *number*
  of people doing repetitive tasks may decrease, the demand for high-impact, visionary
  product thinkers will remain essential.'
