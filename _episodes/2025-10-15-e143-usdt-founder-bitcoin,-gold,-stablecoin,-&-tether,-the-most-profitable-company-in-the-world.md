summary: '## Podcast Episode E143: USDT Founder Summary


  This episode features an in-depth conversation with **Paolo Ardoino**, the CEO of
  Tether (USDT issuer) and CTO of Bitfinex, focusing on Tether''s massive profitability,
  its underlying philosophy, and its broader mission to bring stability to the world
  through accessible technology.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Cryptocurrency/Stablecoins**, specifically the business
  model, technological infrastructure, and societal impact of **Tether (USDT)**. Secondary
  themes include the philosophy of building profitable, mission-driven technology
  companies, the importance of financial accessibility, and the role of technology
  in global stability.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Stablecoin Utility:** Stablecoins like USDT are framed as the "ultimate social
  network" because money transfer is the most fundamental form of human interaction,
  offering value and information transfer simultaneously.

  *   **UX Deficiencies in Blockchain:** Ardoino highlights that current blockchain
  technology often suffers from poor user experience (UX), citing the example that
  moving USDT on Ethereum often requires holding and paying gas fees in ETH, which
  hinders mass adoption outside of speculative circles.

  *   **Focus on Utility over Hype:** Tether''s success is positioned as proof that
  building genuinely useful, real-world applications (like borderless digital dollars)
  is more sustainable than focusing solely on hype, meme coins, or internal ecosystem
  incentives.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Unprecedented Profitability:** Tether is generating approximately **$100 million
  in profit per employee** annually, driven significantly by high interest rates on
  its reserves (a factor less present before 2022). They made $13.7 billion last year.

  *   **Profit Reinvestment Philosophy:** Approximately **95% of Tether''s profits
  are reinvested** into new ideas and technologies rather than being distributed to
  shareholders, signaling a long-term commitment to expanding their mission beyond
  stablecoins.

  *   **Capital as Strategic Advantage:** Ardoino believes Tether possesses the rare
  trifecta of **Philosophy, Innovation, and Capital**. This capital allows them to
  pursue their vision without being derailed by external VC incentives that often
  force companies to prioritize short-term profit over long-term mission.

  his obsessive work ethic (sleeping only five fragmented hours nightly) and his passion
  for coding, which he views as his primary form of creative expression.

  company"** whose ultimate goal is societal stability.

  *   **Plasma:** Mentioned as a company Tether invested in, focused on building single-purpose
  blockchains designed to make stablecoin transfers cheaper and easier, improving
  UX.

  While not a deep dive into specific regulations, the discussion implies a regulatory
  context by emphasizing that Tether''s mission is to democratize finance for the
  unbanked and those in high-inflation economies (like Turkey, Nigeria, Argentina).
  The success of USDT is seen as filling a void left by traditional, inaccessible
  finance.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  *   **Expansion Beyond Finance:** Tether intends to leverage its capital and technological
  innovation to intermediate and open up other industries, including **telecommunications,
  social media, and energy**.

  *   **Mission-Driven Growth:** The company''s incentive structure is unique: the
  more Tether pushes for openness, decentralization, and financial freedom, the more
  profitable it becomes, contrasting sharply with traditional "walled garden" tech
  companies.

  *   **Investment in Safe Assets:** Tether plans to continue investing a portion
  of its profits into "safe assets" like **Bitcoin, Gold, and Land** as the world
  moves toward "darker times."
