    a specific, underserved cohort of indie developers who struggle with traditional
    monetization or VC funding.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The reason why it's not just another meme coin launchpad is, I think, for
    two reasons. The first is that there is a clear distinction in terms of the go-to-market
    strategy here that makes a lot of sense. The go-to-market is to target a supply
    side that is essentially indie app builders and growth hackers who historically
    either under-monetize or can't monetize.
  topic: Business/DeFi Innovation
- impact_reason: A crucial observation regarding regulatory risk management, suggesting
    the platform is actively trying to distance itself from securities classification
    by altering its public language.
  relevance_score: 10

  text: I think that's really trying to scale back on some of the equity-like language

    a segment (indie app devs) that is completely ignored by traditional venture capital.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The interesting thing about the supply side here is that they cannot get venture
    funding, and venture is not interested in this cohort.
  topic: Investment/Adoption
- impact_reason: Quantifies the market gap and argues that tokenization provides a
    necessary mechanism for these small-scale, high-quality projects to monetize their
    potential equity value.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: From an app dev perspective, far less than 1% of the apps that they make can
    realize venture-like outcomes, so they don't get venture money... And I think
    that if you squint, you can see some future on this platform where they are in
    fact doing that. So this is—I think this is fundamentally an underserved segment
    of capital markets.
  topic: DeFi Innovation/Investment
- impact_reason: A highly concise, memorable phrase summarizing the intersection of
    rapid, low-friction development (vibe-coding) and instant, speculative capital
    formation (meme coins).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: My version of squinting at this thing is that it's capital formation in the
    vibe-coding era.
  topic: Strategy/Technology
- impact_reason: A prediction that the era of easy, high valuations for hastily launched
    L2s or projects based solely on hype is ending, suggesting a move toward more
    rigorous fundamental assessment.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The inability or the ability of people to just spin up an L2 and get multi-billion
    dollar valuations is increasingly becoming less common. So the market's going
    to normalize.
  topic: market trends
- impact_reason: Draws a crucial distinction between speculative tokens (like those
    on Zora, in this context) and tokens representing scarce value, hinting at the
    future direction of utility-driven tokenization (revenue share).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Belief is very different in that these are actually scarce units of value.
    A cash flow stream is scarce, and again, if you squint and look into the future,
    you can imagine some sort of revenue share with token holders or rights to token
    holders.
  topic: defi
- impact_reason: 'Raises a significant ethical dilemma in the current Web3 fundraising
    landscape: launching tokens without rights or utility, effectively monetizing
    retail speculation while insulating the founder from liability.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Is this thing deeply unethical? Because I think from a thousand-foot view,
    you're a founder with an idea, you are asking people, or allowing people, to invest
    in a meme coin related to your idea with the sense that you may build an app in
    the future... but you're given no actual equity rights. What we know about meme
    coins is they always trend to zero.
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: A direct indictment of current US regulators (specifically naming
    Gary Gensler) for failing to provide necessary clarity, which forces issuers into
    legally ambiguous positions.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: it's frankly those guys' fault that we're in the situation we're in today.
    Regulatory clarity should have been an eight-year-ago thing, and it just never
    happened.
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: Details a specific, innovative mechanism (anti-bot bonding curve
    fee structure) designed to combat sniping, a major pain point in token launches.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: they have some kind of partnership with Medior where the bonding curve that
    these Belief tokens trade on has an anti-bot mechanism where the fees are initially
    higher until it gets to a certain market cap, and then the fees drop.
  topic: Technology/Innovation
- impact_reason: Clearly identifies front-running/sniping immediately post-launch
    as the 'worst thing' about the Pump Fun model, providing context for why anti-bot
    measures are necessary.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: 'This is meant to discourage what I think is the worst thing about Pump: which
    is that a majority of tokens are bought immediately after their launch, like in
    the same block.'
  topic: Regulation/Compliance (Self-Regulation)
- impact_reason: A powerful analogy comparing sniping/MEV to systemic issues in traditional
    finance (NASDAQ), arguing that fundamental utility and benefits outweigh these
    technical frictions.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's going to be a cat and mouse, but at the end of the day, it's not going
    to stop—it's not going to stop Pump from being successful for the same reason
    that MEV is not going to stop a chain from being successful, or it's not going
    to stop NASDAQ from being successful.
  topic: Technology/Strategy
- impact_reason: Directly challenges the regulatory distinction between traditional
    crowdfunding (Kickstarter) and crypto crowdfunding (Belief), implicitly questioning
    why Belief might face different securities scrutiny.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Kickstarter promises you a T-shirt or a version of the board game that you're
    funding or whatever it is, and they seem to have done fine. So what is meaningfully
    different about this thing, Kickstarter? And if Kickstarter did the securities
    thing, why can't Belief?
  topic: Regulation/Policy
- impact_reason: Provides a concrete, recent data point showing the rapid emergence
    and dominance of a new launchpad (Belief) over an established one (Pump Fun) on
    Solana, signaling a significant shift in meme coin/token launch dynamics.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Of the top 25 new Solana token launches this week, 14 of those 25 came from
    Belief. Only seven of them came from Pump Fun, which is a big anomaly if you look
    at the past year of meme coin trading, which is one of the biggest uses of the
    Solana blockchain currently and for the past several months.
  topic: Adoption/Market Trends
- impact_reason: A massive trading volume figure for a new token launchpad, underscoring
    the intense retail appetite and liquidity flowing into novel mechanisms on Solana.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Belief has seen $724 million in 24-hour trading volume, according to the Belief
    screener...
  topic: Market Trends/Adoption
- impact_reason: 'Highlights a key differentiator: introducing curation to the often-chaotic
    token launch environment, appealing to users fatigued by pure, unfiltered launches
    like those on Pump Fun.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The second reason is that there's a curation level on top. So if you look
    at the problems with launchpad platforms in the past... some people won't participate
    because they can't play the trench game, and they don't want to play the trench
    game. And I think that there is a sliver of the market that's looking for a more
    curated experience.
  topic: Strategy/Adoption
- impact_reason: 'Poses the central philosophical conflict of the entire discussion:
    the mismatch between high-risk, high-reward VC models and the speculative nature
    of meme coins.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think the big question then, Ryan, is why should venture-like projects be
    funded with meme coins? Like, to me, that just seems like it's not a great match,
    but convince me.
  topic: Investment Thesis/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Defines the dual-sided market efficiency being created: connecting
    underserved founders with retail capital seeking early-stage exposure.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There's latent demand on both sides, right? There's latent demand on the supply
    side to want to monetize some equity or to raise small amounts of capital and
    then monetize that equity, and on the demand side, there's clearly demand for
    retail to get venture-like upside in these small-cap projects.
  topic: Business Model/Market Dynamics
- impact_reason: Explains the technological shift (AI/low-code reducing development
    friction) that makes idea validation via token speculation a viable first step.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: 'Now, if cursor and these other tools get better, you can create a new app
    in minutes. And so the actual human capital, having to create the thing, isn''t
    as important. Now it''s: do the ideas work? And meme coins are a similarly very
    fast, kind of instant form of capital formation. So it''s like a founder can vibe-code
    an app or come up with an idea, I guess, launch a coin based on it on Belief,
    see if it resonates with the market.'
  topic: Technology/Adoption
- impact_reason: Identifies key missing elements (transparency, standardization of
    issuance/vesting) that must be addressed for the model to gain long-term credibility.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Docs on Belief are scarce. It's obviously in early stages; it's only been
    around for a few months in the current iteration, essentially just a few days
    or a few weeks. What's this platform going to evolve into over time? Will issuance
    or token allocation for the issuing team be standardized? Will vesting be standardized?
  topic: Regulation/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Identifies a major friction point for Web2 adoption: the need for
    platforms to provide education and best practices for new token issuers, signaling
    a necessary evolution in tooling.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: no platform has done today. So they're clearly thinking very carefully about
    this, because remember, their customers on the supply side are Web2—these guys
    are unfamiliar with crypto—and there's going to be a hand-holding and education
    process that they need, that Belief needs to go through.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: A sharp critique of the current state of crypto markets, emphasizing
    the pervasive influence of speculative, non-fundamental trading (meme coins) on
    broader capital markets.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: crypto capital markets are very adjacent to meme coin markets, which are a
    game of chicken and market manipulation and games and retail behavior.
  topic: investment
- impact_reason: 'A detailed critique of product design failure: prioritizing ideological
    alignment (appeasing a specific user cohort) over core utility (financial assessment
    features for a launchpad).'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The more important point about Zora was that it was a token launchpad, and
    in order to appease ETH natives who are more focused on David versus Goliath,
    big tech versus little tech fight, and creator monetization, to appease that cohort
    of people, they removed all the useful features for a launchpad, right?
  topic: business
- impact_reason: Illustrates the current regulatory gray area where issuers rely on
    disclaimers ('meant for fun') to avoid security classification, even if the economic
    reality suggests otherwise.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I went to the Belief creator docs or whatever, and one of them said, 'If you're
    not promising returns, ownership, or financial rights, and the coin is clearly
    meant for fun, you're likely operating in a safe zone.'
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: A strong warning about the cost of regulatory hesitation; waiting
    for perfect clarity means forfeiting market leadership to those willing to take
    calculated risks now.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Belief is not going to be the leader in this kind of launchpad for indie devs;
    it's going to be someone else. And the builders are going to be behind if they
    wait.
  topic: business
- impact_reason: Articulates the trade-off between issuing a non-security collectible
    versus issuing a security that offers tangible rights, highlighting the legal
    tightrope founders walk.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: it feels like you're taking the cost of that risk and offloading it to your
    users essentially, where you probably could add some kind of promise for access
    to future equity for the people who hold your meme coin, or that would be a security,
    right?
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: 'Defines two distinct market niches emerging in the speculative space:
    pure gambling/game theory (Pump Fun) versus early-stage, high-risk startup investment
    (Belief''s curated approach).'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Pump is clearly a fun game of chicken that's achieved incredible PMF, and
    people are going to play that. And I think you could have a subset of people who
    want to play the growth-hacking startup game where you're investing in hyper-micro-cap
    tokens that have a real future.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: Uses concrete user base comparisons (Phantom vs. BeReal) to contextualize
    the current state of crypto adoption, suggesting the overall market, even in niche
    areas, is still nascent.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There are only 15 million multi-active users on Phantom. There are 40 million
    multi-active users for BeReal, which is widely considered a not-so-great kind
    of successful, probably not consumer app. So we're still pretty early, and this
    might be early.
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: Argues that the nature of Belief's curated tokens (potentially pseudo-equity)
    necessitates stronger anti-sniping measures than the pure gambling nature of Pump
    Fun.

  text: You need some sort of civil resistance—I think in—you need more sniper resistance
    in Belief, or sorry, sniper resistance in Belief than you do in Pump Fun.

    entertainment and potential financial upside, ignoring secondary issues like sniping.'

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If we're in the vibe-coding era, it does allow you to have many, many apps
    or projects more quickly, but it is still more finite than, hey, upload a JPEG
    and then launch a token, and that was kind of the thing that propelled Pump Fun.
  topic: Web3 Vision/Adoption

    of curated, idea-based token launches (Belief) versus the pure, high-volume meme
    coin launch mechanism (Pump Fun).

- impact_reason: Argues that lower market caps for these specific projects are healthy
    corrections, suggesting current valuations are inflated relative to realistic
    outcomes.

  text: So any moderation lower in market cap for the current set of Belief tokens,
    I think, is healthy because that would be a realistic assessment of the financial
    outcome for the things that are launching or the things that are launching on
    the curation layer of Belief today.

    like MoonPay and Exodus from the security of the Ledger ecosystem.

    model remains fundamentally successful, implying snipers are either tolerated
    or are part of the ecosystem's dynamic.

    take, but it still works, and it's clearly still working.

    but I don't know if it's actually reflected in user behavior how heavily sniped

    sad and discourages my own personal use of them.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: The Solana Token Launchpad Coming for Venture
  Capital | Ryan Conner


  This episode of Lightspeed, featuring Ryan Conner, Head of Research at Blockworks
  Research, centers on the emergence of **Belief**, a new Solana-based token launchpad
  that is positioning itself as a curated platform for funding indie application developers,
  effectively acting as a "meme coin launchpad for venture capital."


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the intersection of **meme coin mechanics (Solana ecosystem)**
  and **early-stage startup capital formation**, specifically targeting the underserved
  cohort of **indie application developers** who typically cannot access traditional
  Venture Capital (VC). Secondary themes include the evolution of token launchpads,
  the implications of "vibe-coding," and the regulatory ambiguity surrounding token
  issuance.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Curation vs. Permissionless:** Belief differentiates itself from platforms
  like Pump Fun by offering a curated experience. While anyone can launch a token,
  the Belief team filters and features projects attached to interesting app ideas
  on their iPhone app, appealing to users wary of the "trench game" on open platforms.

  *   **Vibe-Coding and Rapid Prototyping:** The speed of modern development tools
  (like Cursor) combined with the instant price discovery of meme coins allows founders
  to "vibe-code" an idea, launch a token on Belief, and gauge market resonance *before*
  committing significant resources to building the actual application.

  *   **Feature Parity with Launchpads:** Unlike Zora (which the hosts argue stripped
  out necessary financial features to appeal to an "ETH native" narrative), Belief
  retains essential launchpad features like price charts, allowing users to assess
  the relative financial characteristics of the tokens.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Underserved Capital Market:** Belief targets indie app developers whose per-app
  revenue rarely reaches VC-scale outcomes ($150k–$7M top percentile), meaning they
  are ignored by traditional venture funding. Belief offers them a mechanism to monetize
  potential equity or raise small amounts of capital.

  *   **Retail Demand for VC Upside:** There is strong latent demand from retail investors
  for venture-like upside in small-cap, high-risk projects, which meme coin markets
  currently satisfy. Belief attempts to channel this demand toward actual, albeit
  nascent, application ideas.

  *   **Risk of Association:** The reliance on meme coin liquidity means founders
  are taking on capital backers (meme coin traders) who might have "crazy demands"
  or bring negative baggage, as evidenced by the controversy surrounding the Jeff
  Hu (ZeroRow creator) situation.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Belief:** The central project, a curated Solana token launchpad for indie
  app developers, led by founder **Ben Pastor** (previously founded the "Nugs" fake
  chicken nugget startup).

  *   **Pump Fun:** Mentioned as the highly successful, non-curated benchmark for
  meme coin launches on Solana.

  *   **Zora:** Used as a counter-example; criticized for removing necessary financial
  features to mask its function as a token launchpad.

  *   **Ledger:** Featured as a sponsor, highlighting their hardware wallets'' support
  for securing SOL and SPL tokens.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Legal Ambiguity and Risk Transfer:** The platform explicitly states tokens
  are not promising returns, ownership, or financial rights, aiming to keep them in
  the "collectible" or "fun" zone to avoid securities classification.

  *   **Front-Running Regulation:** Conner argues that founders must "front-run" regulatory
  change (like Uber or Airbnb did) rather than waiting for clarity, as delaying means
  missing the market opportunity entirely.

  *   **Blame on Regulators:** The current messy middle state where issuers struggle
  to balance utility with compliance is attributed to the lack of regulatory clarity
  over the past several years under the current administration.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where capital formation becomes increasingly
  rapid and tied to market sentiment ("vibe-coding era"). Belief represents an attempt
  to formalize and curate this process, potentially creating a viable, albeit risky,
  alternative funding source for small-scale builders who are currently excluded from
  traditional VC. The market is expected to normalize over time, reducing the most
  extreme volatility seen in early meme coin launches.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto professionals, Web3 investors, Solana ecosystem participants, and founders**
  interested in novel capital formation mechanisms and the evolution of token launchpads
  beyond pure speculation.'
