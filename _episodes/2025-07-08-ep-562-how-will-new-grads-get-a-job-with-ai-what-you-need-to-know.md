summary: '## Podcast Summary: EP 562: How Will New Grads Get a Job with AI? What You
  Need to Know


  This 50-minute episode of the *Everyday AI Show* focuses on the alarming trend of
  rising unemployment among recent college graduates, directly linking this crisis
  to the rapid integration and displacement effects of Artificial Intelligence, particularly
  Generative AI. Host Jordan Wilson argues that this is a structural shift caused
  by the negligence of higher education institutions and the profit-driven decisions
  of corporations.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **impact of AI on entry-level employment and the crisis
  in higher education**. Key themes include:

  *   Analyzing data from an Oxford Economics study showing high unemployment concentrated
  among new graduates.

  *   Critiquing universities for banning or ignoring AI integration over the past
  several years.

  *   Identifying corporate behavior (quiet firing/not replacing retirees) as a contributing
  factor.

  *   Providing actionable advice for employers, parents, and students on navigating
  this new workforce reality.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **AI Literacy as Oxygen:** The necessity of AI proficiency has shifted from
  being a niche skill to a fundamental requirement ("oxygen") for modern employment
  across all sectors, a reality employers now demand.

  *   **Ineffective Institutional Response:** A significant majority (70-80%) of higher
  education institutions lack comprehensive AI policies, and faculty confidence in
  using AI for teaching is extremely low (only 14% confident).

  *   **Lagging Societal Effect:** The negative employment impact seen now is the
  delayed consequence (a "lagging effect," similar to COVID-19''s timeline) of universities
  ignoring AI adoption between 2022 and 2024.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Collapse of Entry-Level Hiring:** Tech sector hiring has seen a significant
  contraction (down 40% from pandemic highs), and this structural collapse in entry-level
  roles is expected to bleed into other industries.

  *   **Shareholder vs. Human Interest:** Fortune 500 CEOs are criticized for prioritizing
  shareholder returns over workforce stability, accelerating job displacement via
  AI adoption.

  *   **Advice for Private Companies:** Non-public companies are warned against following
  the playbook of public companies, which often feel pressured to use AI buzzwords
  for stock performance rather than focusing on sustainable human integration.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Oxford Economics:** The source of the key study highlighting that 85% of the
  rise in recent graduate unemployment is concentrated in this cohort due to structural
  shifts in tech hiring driven by AI since mid-2023.

  *   **Higher Education Leaders/University Presidents:** Singled out as the primary
  culprits, alongside corporate CEOs, for their "negligence" and "self-serving" decisions
  in banning or ignoring AI education.

  *   **Adobe, Microsoft, Nvidia:** Mentioned as companies that partner with the podcast
  host''s organization for AI strategy and employee training, indicating the high
  demand for practical AI upskilling among established corporations.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The host predicts a significant contraction in the higher education landscape within
  the next 15 to 20 years, suggesting many current colleges and universities will
  "go belly up" because their core value proposition—job placement rates—is being
  undermined by their failure to adapt to AI. The concept of traditional full-time
  employment is also expected to continue evolving.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Students/Recent Graduates**, **Parents of
  Students**, **Higher Education Administrators/Faculty**, and **Business Leaders/Employers**
  who need to understand the immediate and long-term structural changes affecting
  the talent pipeline and workforce readiness.'
