  text: It's super easy where you have the opportunity to sort of curate and selectively
    display to the LLMs that are coming through what the most important content on
    your website is so that they don't miss it.
  topic: SEO/AI Strategy
- impact_reason: Highlights the crucial difference between static training data and
    dynamic, real-time information retrieval (inference time), which necessitates
    fresh, accessible content.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: When they know that the answer isn't in the training set, that's an inference
    time query that they have to go out, grab information because they're not searching
    the web and they're not crawling.
  topic: Technology/LLM Mechanics
- impact_reason: 'Provides a critical technical constraint for developers: LLM agents
    cannot handle complex client-side rendering or simulated user interaction.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The one thing we do know about the LLM crawlers is that they don't execute
    JavaScript, and they're not capable of human interaction tasks like untoggling
    something to get the data that's behind the toggle or entering a query into a
    box.
  topic: Technology/AI Limitations
- impact_reason: Defines the `llms.txt` file's function as a strategic content roadmap,
    linking it to established SEO concepts like hub-and-spoke models.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is more akin to a pillar strategy when it comes down to interlinking
    and hub-and-spoke type of strategies of content. But this is really the roadmap.
  topic: Technology/SEO Strategy
- impact_reason: 'A strong analogy summarizing the purpose of the new file: explicitly
    prioritizing content value for Large Language Models.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I love the treasure map analogy. You are able to actually give LLMs the ability
    to understand what you value most on your website...
  topic: Technology/LLMs
- impact_reason: A strong declaration positioning the `llms.txt` file as a significant
    turning point in website-to-AI communication.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I see this as a kind of a watershed moment of how we can communicate to LLMs.
  topic: Technology/LLMs
- impact_reason: 'Crucial warning about the current state of AI compliance: adherence
    to directives like robots.txt or this new file relies on an ''honor system'' rather
    than enforceable regulation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We also understand that the LLMs are on a particular honor system of abiding
    by certain blockages... we don't have a regulatory environment where either the
    robots.txt file or this file is really abided by.
  topic: Technology/Compliance Risk
- impact_reason: 'Offers a counter-intuitive strategic insight on standard adoption:
    multi-vendor neutrality is better than single-vendor dominance (citing AMP as
    a negative example).'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think it's almost a blessing if we don't get a single one large player behind
    it because we wouldn't want—I think you run the risk of alienating other people
    if there's one company that's like, 'Yeah, we're going to make this happen,' and
    then their competitors like, 'Just because of that, we are absolutely not going
    to do that.'
  topic: Business/Standard Adoption
- impact_reason: 'Actionable advice for defining ''most valuable content'' for LLMs:
    align internal documentation with actual customer pain points gathered from support
    channels.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Look at the questions that people ask about your brand, and then look at the
    content that you have that answers those questions. You have to have some means
    or someone in your company that answers phone calls, like talk to your front-line
    customer support people.
  topic: Business/Actionable Advice
- impact_reason: 'Provides a crucial technical insight into current LLM operation:
    inference time often involves immediate data retrieval due to a lack of persistent
    memory, explaining server load spikes.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The LLMs, at least at inference time right now, have no memory. So the reason
    you see these huge spikes in server load from the LLMs coming back and hitting
    a page to answer a question is because every time someone asks that question,
    they have to go collect the data because they have no memory.
  topic: Technical Insight/LLM Architecture
- impact_reason: A powerful, memorable metaphor summarizing the stateless nature of
    current LLM data retrieval during inference.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We got to stop thinking about them like spiders. We have to start thinking
    about them like goldfish. They swim over, they get what they need, they go back,
    they barf it up onto the floor, and then they forget instantly.
  topic: Metaphor/LLM Architecture
- impact_reason: Introduces a novel, critical file type (`llms.txt`) for AI communication,
    distinguishing it immediately from established protocols like `robots.txt`.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The llms.txt is a file that lives in the root, kind of near the robots.txt.
    And you would think that since it's similarly named, it's the same, but it's really
    not. It's very different.
  topic: Technology/AI Indexing
- impact_reason: Provides a powerful, memorable analogy for the function of the file,
    emphasizing quality over quantity for AI discovery.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The llms.txt is there to showcase the best content that you have. And just
    basically, it's like a treasure map that you can hand to the bots they come through
    and say, I know you're looking for good stuff. This is where all the good stuff
    is right here.
  topic: SEO/AI Strategy
- impact_reason: Directly links proactive AI signaling to improved brand visibility
    and faster user resolution in generative search.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What? It's just designed to help the robots find your good content better
    so that they can provide answers to people that are asking questions about your
    brand and get them to that right answer faster.
  topic: Business/Search Visibility
- impact_reason: Clarifies the two distinct operational modes of LLMs relevant to
    content providers, moving beyond just training data concerns.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The LLMs, there are two different phases of what they do. One is the training
    data that everyone seems to focus on, and the other is the inference time query
    answers.
  topic: Technology/LLM Mechanics
- impact_reason: A strong warning about the pitfalls of relying solely on interactive
    interfaces (like gated knowledge bases) for critical data needed by AI agents.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you've done something silly though, like let's say on your knowledge base,
    you've locked everything behind an interface where if you don't—there's no human
    interaction, like to enter a question or something, you can't proceed on to get
    to the data. You might be kind of gatekeeping or blocking off any bots from getting
    those good media answers.
  topic: Technical SEO/AI Access
- impact_reason: A direct, high-stakes warning about content omission leading to reliance
    on potentially unreliable sources (like Reddit) for brand answers.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you don't provide the answers, if you don't provide the content that they
    need to answer that question, you're running the risk that they're going to get
    the answer from, like, Reddit.
  topic: Business/Risk Management
- impact_reason: Positions `llms.txt` not just as a technical directive, but as a
    strategic content prioritization tool, similar to hub-and-spoke models in traditional
    SEO.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is wholly different [from robots.txt and sitemaps]. This is more akin
    to a pillar strategy when it comes down to interlinking and hub [content].
  topic: SEO Strategy/AI Era
- impact_reason: Establishes the historical context of SEO control files (robots.txt,
    sitemaps) and immediately contrasts them with a new, fundamentally different mechanism.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We do put a lot of weight into what robots.txt has allowed us to do to be

summary: '## Summary of Edge of the Web Radio Episode 772: Communicating Value to
  LLMs with Yoast''s Carolyn Shelby


  This episode of *The Edge of the Web Radio* features Carolyn Shelby, Principal SEO
  at Yoast, focusing on the emerging need for websites to communicate content value
  directly to Large Language Models (LLMs) and the introduction of the **`llms.txt`**
  file as a potential solution.


  ---


  ### 1. Main Narrative Arc and Key Discussion Points


  The conversation begins with a lighthearted introduction to Carolyn Shelby, including
  her unique role as Queen of the micronation, Ladonia. The discussion quickly pivots
  to the core technical topic: how search engine optimization (SEO) must evolve to
  interact with generative AI systems like ChatGPT and Google''s AI Overviews. The
  central theme is the shift from traditional crawling/indexing (via `sitemap.xml`
  and `robots.txt`) to explicitly guiding LLMs toward a website’s most authoritative
  content using the new **`llms.txt`** file.


  ### 2. Major Topics, Themes, and Subject Areas Covered


  *   **LLM Interaction:** The difference between LLM training data and real-time
  inference queries.

  *   **Content Prioritization:** Strategies for identifying and showcasing a website''s
  "best content" to AI agents.

  *   **Technical SEO Evolution:** How traditional files (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`)
  compare to the new directive file (`llms.txt`).

  *   **AI Adoption Challenges:** The risk of LLMs relying on less reliable sources
  (like Reddit) if authoritative content isn''t easily accessible.

  *   **Micronations and Digital Sovereignty:** A brief, engaging tangent on Ladonia,
  illustrating concepts of self-declared standards and community building.


  ### 3. Technical Concepts, Methodologies, or Frameworks Discussed


  *   **`llms.txt` File:** A newly proposed, simple **markdown file** placed in the
  root directory, intended to act as a "treasure map" for LLMs, directing them only
  to the most valuable content on the site.

  *   **LLM Crawling vs. Inference:** The distinction between the data used to train
  models and the real-time data retrieval during a user query (inference time). It
  was noted that LLM "crawlers" **do not execute JavaScript** or handle human interaction
  tasks (like toggling interfaces).

  *   **Structured Data/Schema:** Mentioned as a historical example of a standard
  that gained uniform acceptance among search engines.

  *   **Content Strategy Analogy:** The `llms.txt` file is likened to a roadmap for
  hub-and-spoke or pillar content strategies, but specifically for AI consumption.


  ### 4. Business Implications and Strategic Insights


  *   **Risk of Omission:** If a brand fails to guide LLMs, the AI may pull answers
  from less reliable sources (e.g., Reddit), potentially leading to inaccurate technical
  support or brand representation.

  *   **Accessibility:** Yoast developed the `llms.txt` generator because, while easy
  to create manually, many users are uncomfortable curating this specialized file.

  *   **Competitive Neutrality:** The speaker suggests it might be beneficial that
  no single major player (like Google) is aggressively pushing `llms.txt` yet, preventing
  competitors from rejecting it purely based on its originator (unlike AMP or IndexNow).


  ### 5. Key Personalities, Experts, or Thought Leaders Mentioned


  *   **Carolyn Shelby (Yoast):** Principal SEO, expert in technical and enterprise
  SEO, and the featured guest.

  *   **Jeremy Howard:** Credited with proposing the `llms.txt` file format in September
  2024.

  *   **Sponsors/Other Guests:** Bruce Clay (Prewriter.ai), Ross Simmons, Brittany
  Muller, and Barry Adams (mentioned in housekeeping).


  ### 6. Predictions, Trends, or Future-Looking Statements


  *   Yoast’s strategy is to deploy the generator across its 13 million users to rapidly
  influence the adoption curve and help establish `llms.txt` as an industry standard
  for AI communication.

  *   It is predicted that true uniformity in how LLMs adhere to these files will
  be rare, similar to how different search engines utilize Schema markup differently.


  ### 7. Practical Applications and Actionable Advice Provided


  *   **How to Curate Content:** Website owners should identify content that answers
  the most common questions asked about their brand, products, or services.

  *   **Data Sources for Curation:** Use customer support logs, "People Also Ask"
  data, and Google Trends to determine which questions are most critical to answer
  authoritatively.

  *   **Accessibility Check:** Ensure critical knowledge base content is not locked
  behind interfaces requiring human interaction or JavaScript execution, as LLM crawlers
  cannot bypass these barriers.


  ### 8. Controversies, Challenges, or Problems Highlighted


  *   **Adoption Curve:** The primary challenge is getting LLM providers (like OpenAI,
  Google) to agree to respect and utilize this new file format consistently.

  *   **Internal Conflict:** Website owners face the challenge of objectively deciding
  which of their own content is "worthy" of being highlighted in the `llms.txt` file.

  *   **Google''s Mixed Signals:** The observation that Google appears conflicted
  on the health of the web, simultaneously promoting AI Overviews while also having
  news about its PPC revenue being impacted by them.


  ### 9. Context About Why This Conversation Matters to the Industry


  This conversation is crucial because it addresses the **next frontier of technical
  SEO**: communicating directly with the AI systems that are increasingly mediating
  user access to information. As AI Overviews and generative search become dominant,
