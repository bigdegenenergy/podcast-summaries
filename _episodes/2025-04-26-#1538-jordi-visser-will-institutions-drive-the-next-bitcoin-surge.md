  text: Something else happened in 1971, which feeds into the Bitcoin standard, or
    1976. This is when the personal computer was born. So, this was the beginning
    of the digital economy.
  topic: Technology/Adoption
- impact_reason: 'This is the core thesis: Bitcoin''s necessity is now driven not
    just by individual distrust, but by governmental/global distrust in the existing
    reserve system.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There's two reasons why this is the beginning of Bitcoin. We will no longer
    have trust from the globe. So, there's one thing that Bitcoin was created with
    a lack of trust on banks, a lack of trust on the government. But now the governments
    of the world don't trust the reserve currency status, and there is no replacement.
    So, the birth of Bitcoin has to come from the realization that you cannot transact
    payments with gold, and all of the countries in the world are fighting to make
    stablecoin a payment system.
  topic: Adoption/Macro Thesis
- impact_reason: 'Presents a core investment thesis: Bitcoin''s immunity to geopolitical/supply
    chain risks (like tariffs/China dependency) makes it an attractive growth asset
    when traditional tech is hampered by these issues.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think we're at the point where people are going to have no trust that this
    won't happen again. And Bitcoin is a technology and an innovation that has no
    need on the tariffs. It is not impacted by it. So, I think you're going to see
    Bitcoin outperform, and then all the momentum will start to fit into it when technology
    stocks are not working because people want growth.

    accelerating going forward.
  topic: Technology/Investment Thesis

    investors are valuing the *future* scarcity/growth of Bitcoin held per share,
    treating the ETF structure as a proxy for future BTC accumulation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: My understanding of these vehicles [ETFs] is that people are actually paying
    for the future purchasing of Bitcoin, kind of the increase in the Bitcoin per
    share. They're saying to themselves, 'If I buy right now and let's say one share
    equals one Bitcoin, I am going to try to figure out, well, what is the Bitcoin
    per share going to be in the future?'
  topic: Investment/Technology (ETFs)
- impact_reason: 'This is the core thesis: Bitcoin''s long-term value proposition
    is replacing Treasuries as global collateral, and corporate wrappers like MSTR
    derive massive premiums by controlling access to that collateral.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: That's why I think everyone is still fixated on this debt fiat-backed system,
    and capital structure is a big part of that. In the future, you're coming about
    Bitcoin per share. Michael Saylor sold me on the fact, and that's the reason why
    the premium for his company relative to his holdings, if he's able to lend this
    out, if it becomes the collateral that replaces Treasury, what is the value of
    that if he has a moat on it?

    paving the way for Bitcoin.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I'm going to take people on a history lesson because there's something unique
    that I haven't heard people really talk about. So, let's start with the global
    reserve currency. I think everyone knows that for the US, it started after World
    War II, but there's really only been two global reserve currencies. So, this has
    been an experiment. It's just said it was first the British pound, and it became
    the US dollar. But the new experiment, which is completely new, is to get off
    the gold standard. So, this is an unbacked global reserve currency.
  topic: Adoption/Macro Thesis
- impact_reason: This links historical financial crises directly to the instability
    of the current fiat system, providing a strong rationale for seeking alternatives
    like Bitcoin.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So, 1971, unbacked global reserve currency; 1985, we have the Plaza Accord;
    1997, we have the Asian financial crisis; 2008, we have the financial crisis;
    then we have COVID; then we have the largest bank run in history in the fastest
    amount of time in Silicon Valley Bank. So, if you go back over history, which
    all macro people do, and you look at what's happened to this concept of the global
    reserve currency or any kind of situation where debt-to-GDP and the fiscal deficit
    gets to these levels, it ends in depression, it ends in deflation, it ends in
    war, it ends in revolution.
  topic: Regulation/Macro Thesis
- impact_reason: Directly addresses the erosion of confidence in traditional safe-haven
    assets (US Treasuries), a key driver for capital flight into assets like Bitcoin.
  relevance_score: 9

  text: What has happened so far this year is people are starting to realize that

    starting to lose trust.

- impact_reason: A bold prediction about Bitcoin's near-term market capitalization
    ranking, signaling extreme confidence in its rapid ascent relative to traditional
    assets.

  text: Well, the governments didn't want to lose that control. Well, they've lost

    the end of the end of the year behind gold.

    of value for the wealthy.

    push factors from traditional markets and positive pull factors from crypto''s
    own growth and opportunity.'

  text: This is a world where the pessimism in the traditional world pushes people
    to Bitcoin, and at the same time, Bitcoin is giving the market more abundant opportunities
    to invest, and therefore, that just like accelerates the capital flow into the
    market.
  topic: Adoption/Investment
- impact_reason: 'This explains the fundamental driver for institutional adoption:
    they need growth/yield to meet long-term liabilities, forcing them away from traditional
    low-yield assets like bonds, making Bitcoin a necessity, not just speculation.'

    they have to make.'

    speak when he spoke at your conference, he's like, 'We are getting lots of interest

    people have underestimated that now there's a decoupling. It means I can buy this,

    and I had gold in my pockets and we went out to Starbucks, we'd have a hard time
    buying what we wanted to buy trying to exchange those two things. If we had PayPal,

summary: '## Podcast Summary: #1538 Jordi Visser | Will Institutions Drive the Next
  Bitcoin Surge?


  This episode of the Pomp Podcast features Anthony Pompliano (Pomp) in conversation
  with Jordi Visser, focusing on the potential transition toward a "Bitcoin Standard,"
  the decoupling of Bitcoin from traditional tech stocks, and the shifting global
  monetary order.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Macroeconomics and Cryptocurrency**, specifically:

  *   The erosion of the US Dollar''s status as the global reserve currency post-1971.

  *   The emergence of Bitcoin as a potential decentralized, resilient alternative.

  *   The impact of US-China trade tensions (tariffs, supply chain reliance on rare
  earths) on traditional markets.

  *   The relationship between Bitcoin and technology stocks, particularly regarding
  decoupling during liquidity crises.

  *   The future valuation challenges posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI) across
  traditional equities.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Digital Economy Evolution:** The transition from the personal computer (1971)
  to the internet, mobile, and cloud has created a "violently growing" digital economy
  that requires a native digital monetary system.

  *   **Stablecoins as a Payment Threat:** The global rise of stablecoins, largely
  dollar-backed, is forcing a realization that existing fiat payment rails are insufficient,
  paving the way for Bitcoin/stablecoin transactions globally.

  *   **Bitcoin as the Future S&P 500:** Visser posits that Bitcoin is the "S&P 500
  of the future" in a world dominated by AI, as its fixed supply makes it one of the
  few assets whose long-term value can still be reasonably assessed, unlike most software
  companies facing imminent AI disruption.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Decoupling Confirmed:** Bitcoin has already begun decoupling from tech stocks,
  evidenced by its year-to-date gains while tech stocks remain significantly down.

  *   **Underperformance of Traditional Assets:** Visser believes assets like bonds
  and many securities will continue to underperform inflation due to ongoing debasement
  and loss of trust.

  *   **Institutional Flow:** The shift is gradual, with capital reducing holdings
  in underperforming securities and flowing into Bitcoin, which is insulated from
  geopolitical risks like tariffs. Bitcoin''s price appreciation de-risks it in the
  eyes of institutional investors.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordi Visser:** Guest, offering macro-economic and structural views on the
  shift to a Bitcoin standard.

  *   **Anthony Pompliano (Pomp):** Host, driving the conversation on institutional
  adoption and market correlation.

  *   **Bridgewater Memo:** Mentioned as a source of bearish sentiment in the broader
  market, which Visser contrasts with his bullish outlook on Bitcoin.

  *   **Cantor, SoftBank, Tether (New Entrant 21):** Mentioned as a consortium entering
  the space, signaling growing institutional/traditional finance interest in digital
  assets.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Loss of Trust in Reserve Status:** The administration appears to be accepting
  a weaker dollar and is losing trust in the traditional reserve currency status,
  evidenced by trade policy shifts (e.g., potential easing of China tariffs).

  *   **Government''s Dilemma:** Governments have effectively lost the fight against
  decentralized finance/crypto adoption; they are now trying to lead the crypto innovation
  side (e.g., stablecoin legislation) while managing the decline of the dollar''s
  dominance.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward a parallel monetary system where Bitcoin and stablecoins
  facilitate global transactions, especially for large bilateral trade, while national
  fiat currencies persist for local use. The acceleration of AI will make traditional
  equity valuation models obsolete, further cementing Bitcoin''s appeal as a scarce,
  non-disruptable asset. Visser predicts Bitcoin could become the second-largest asset
  globally by the end of the year, behind gold.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Financial Professionals, Macro Investors,
  Crypto Strategists, and Institutional Allocators** seeking deep analysis on the
  intersection of monetary policy, geopolitical risk, and digital asset valuation.'
