  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: A zero would be language around new tokens is vague, non-committal, or missing
    entirely. A one would be plans around additional tokens are defined clearly. And
    a two, or getting a two out of two, would be, 'Team representative will not launch
    additional tokens.'
  topic: Tokenomics/Transparency

    token launches are strategic business operations or just product line extensions,
    which affects long-term viability assessment.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Well, it is like, "Oh gosh, well, that is cool," but the premise is this was
    the future operations of the protocol as a business, not just this one product
    line. So that is just important for investors to know.
  topic: Investment/Business Strategy
- impact_reason: Emphasizes the open-source, collaborative nature of establishing
    industry standards, inviting community contribution to governance and framework
    design.
  relevance_score: 9

  text: 'So it is sort of like a call to action for all of the crypto community as
    well: "Do you think these are the right questions? If not, this is an open-source
    framework that we should add around together and help push it forward."'
  topic: Strategy/Technology
- impact_reason: Draws a direct parallel between decentralized project transparency
    and the stringent disclosure requirements (S-1 filing) of centralized public markets,
    legitimizing the concept.
  relevance_score: 9

    and positions the framework as a crucial, trusted screening tool to mitigate onboarding
    bad actors.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The worst-case scenario of the fail state for you is you unintentionally aid
    and embed a scammer in that process. And this could be a great tool of, 'Okay,
    if you do this, and I can read your responses, and I am excited about the way
    you have structured your operation, then okay, we will help you,' because now
    I do have that ability to actually understand that set of information in a trusted
    way, that you are not actively trying to harm the market.
  topic: Strategy/Business
- impact_reason: 'A powerful heuristic: silence or refusal to participate in a transparency
    standard becomes a negative signal equivalent to a low score.'

    based on transparency metrics.

  text: I was going to say for me, I agree with Dan. My measure of success would be
    that in a year, if you asked a liquid fund who had never seen this, who are the
    good actors in terms of token holder transparency, who are the bad actors, and
    they give you a list, and then you looked at this framework, it would separate
    it out just the same way.
  topic: Investment/Adoption
- impact_reason: Indicates that major centralized entities (exchanges) are actively
    seeking standardized tools for due diligence, validating the framework's utility
    beyond retail investors.

    good assets are undervalued, leading good sellers to exit.'

  text: Because there was no signal to separate these two cars, what happened is everybody
    priced every used car at kind of the average of lemons and peaches, right? Lemons
    being more valuable, peaches being less valuable.
  topic: Investment/Market Analysis
- impact_reason: Uses a powerful analogy (Bezos/AWS) to illustrate how equity investors
    benefit from a company's entire future product suite, a benefit often denied to
    token holders due to secondary token launches.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: You have, for example, you have the concern of multiple tokens. If you back
    a founder early stage in an equity, if you back Jeff Bezos when he is opening
    a bookstore, you get to benefit when he starts AWS and that becomes the big revenue
    driver of the business.
  topic: Investment/Business
- impact_reason: Validates the TTF's purpose by stating that high-quality teams *desire*
    a standardized way to prove their legitimacy to the market.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And so that is where we really saw sort of the opportunity to lie here. It
    was like, look, if you go talk to any team that is doing things the right way
    and building a great product and not trying to exert effort to avoid a lot of
    these scam techniques that Felipe has described, those people want a tool to explain,
    "Hey, here is what we are doing."
  topic: Strategy/Technology
- impact_reason: Provides real-world evidence (Circle's equity performance) showing
    that stablecoin businesses, when structured as traditional equities, can command
    significant premiums, contrasting with the discounted token market.

  text: if you look at Circle's IPO, right? The IPO price was about $30, $31 opening
    day. The first quoted price was about $70, so already 2x above that, the IPO price.
    And then what, three or four days after, it was trading at $120.
  topic: Adoption/Investment
- impact_reason: Provides the foundational math for calculating required returns in
    traditional finance (Risk-Free Rate + Equity Risk Premium), setting the benchmark
    against which tokens are measured.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If the equity risk premium is 5% and a 10-year treasury is 4.5%, then you
    need to earn a 9.5% return to be comfortable with that opportunity as an institutional
    investor, right, on average.
  topic: Investment
- impact_reason: Derives the standard P/E multiple (22x) for established equity based
    on the stated risk-free rate and risk premium, serving as the baseline valuation
    that tokens fail to meet.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So if you need a 5% or 4.5% kind of cash yield, that you do one over the cash
    yield, sorry, for all the math, you get to a price-to-earnings multiple of 22,
    right?
  topic: Investment
- impact_reason: Identifies a structural driver exacerbating the supply of low-quality
    or non-viable projects ('lemons') due to VC fund mechanics, fueling market inefficiency.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: VC funds invest in early-stage private projects, and the way they are structured,
    the deployment schedule basically forces them to keep on investing in those projects.
    And that grows even more the supply of those lemons that we have.
  topic: Business/Market Structure
- impact_reason: Articulates the mindset of many market participants during the bull
    run—a desire for returns decoupled from underlying value creation—which is now
    being challenged.

    proposal) aimed at providing clarity and a pathway for decentralization, crucial
    for builder confidence.

- impact_reason: Summarizes the core governance and trust issues plaguing many crypto
    projects, which are familiar pain points for TradFi investors but often hidden
    in crypto.

- impact_reason: Advocates for mandatory disclosure of related-party transactions,
    drawing a parallel to public market requirements to improve transparency.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The only people who will know that are the investors that participated in
    the round if there was a secondary. And I think the related-party transactions
    are very common and need to be disclosed in public markets, and that is no different
    for an arm's length here, right?
  topic: Regulation/Strategy
- impact_reason: Acknowledges the benefits of permissionless capital formation (speed,
    low cost) while framing the push for disclosure as a necessary step to curb abuse,
    not stifle innovation.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We are absolutely not trying to say that is a bad thing or that should not
    happen. We are just trying to give the teams that are doing the right thing this
    tool, right? And so because I do not think the lack of disclosure that exists
    today is inherently a bad thing—we have so many great products that have been
    built in this regime—it has just created a breeding ground for abuse largely.
  topic: Business/Strategy

    as a prerequisite for trust, mirroring the philosophy of public market regulation,
    rather than judging the project''s inherent quality.'
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Once again, we are not assessing the fundamentals with this framework to quality;
    we just want to have more transparency. So just like public markets, it is more
    questions of disclosure over merit, transparency, fundamentals.
  topic: Regulation/Strategy
- impact_reason: Frames regulation as inevitable and shifts the focus to shaping the
    *nature* of that regulation, suggesting self-regulation can be beneficial.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced

    a lot of success stories of self-regulation within an industry being for the net
    benefit of that industry.

    aiming to avoid being a subjective 'seal of approval' initially.

    pieces. Like I think Hester Peirce wrote a great piece again on Safe Harbor 2.0,
    and a lot of those ideas are certainly coming to life in this framework.
  topic: Regulation
- impact_reason: Explains the benefit of open-sourcing the framework—it democratizes
    access to due diligence information for retail users, not just institutional funds.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Once there is no one source of truth, at least we are sharing some of that
    information. It may seem obvious for us investing in crypto on a daily basis,
    but if you are just a normal crypto user, you may not see the behind-the-scenes;
    you may not have access to that information in the first place.

    this rating to rate you poorly, you are going to say, 'No, they are not selling

    how do you think about that?
  topic: Regulation
- impact_reason: Explains the methodology behind the scoring weights, demonstrating
    that the framework is built on consensus from both investors and builders.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The way we came up with the specific weights going from zero to three is just
    by querying a very large database of, on one hand, funds, liquid funds in the
    space, and on the other hand, a lot of the top builders, top devs working at a
    myriad of projects all over the crypto space, and just aggregating the answers
    we got.

    as an analogy for the desired level of transparency in crypto projects.

    telling you if that is a good or a bad thing; it is just you legally have to disclose
    that.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Empire | Introducing The Token Transparency Framework


  This 68-minute episode of *Empire* centers on the launch of the **Token Transparency
  Framework (TTF)**, a grassroots initiative designed to combat the severe lack of
  transparency in the token market, which the hosts and guests argue is preventing
  the industry from achieving mainstream adoption and institutional capital inflow.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion is deeply rooted in **Crypto/Web3**, specifically focusing on **token
  economics, capital formation, market structure, and the critical need for standardized
  disclosure** to improve investor confidence and valuation in the token ecosystem.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **The Lemon Market Analogy:** The core problem is framed using George Akerlof’s
  "Lemon Market" theory, where asymmetric information (sellers knowing more about
  quality than buyers) drives good assets (peaches) out of the market, leaving only
  low-quality assets (lemons). In crypto, this means high-quality projects are undervalued
  because investors cannot distinguish them from scams or poorly managed tokens.

  *   **Token vs. Equity Rights:** A major structural flaw highlighted is the ambiguity
  regarding cash flow distribution. Unlike equity, where rights are clear, many token
  projects direct revenue streams (e.g., protocol fees) to equity holders or foundations,
  leaving token holders with incentive alignment but no direct economic entitlement.

  *   **Need for Standardized Disclosure:** The TTF is proposed as the necessary tool
  to solve this ambiguity by providing a standardized format for projects to communicate
  essential information, allowing "peaches" to self-identify and separate themselves
  from "lemons."


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Exorbitant Token Risk Premium:** Due to structural issues (lack of legal protection,
  opaque cash flows), tokens demand a significantly higher risk premium (estimated
  at **20%**) compared to equities (**5%**). This translates to massive valuation
  discounts for tokens—potentially **80%** compared to their equity counterparts for
  similar underlying businesses.

  *   **Disincentivizing Good Founders:** This high cost of capital forces high-quality
  founders to choose traditional equity structures over launching tokens, starving
  the token market of the best builders.

  *   **The End of the "Everything Bubble" Lessons:** The current market correction
  is forcing the industry to confront fundamentals (like revenue and cash flow) that
  were ignored during the zero-interest-rate, speculative boom of 2020-2021.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Akerlof (Economist):** Originator of the "Lemon Market" concept.

  *   **Uniswap:** Cited as a famous example where significant front-end fees flowed
  to equity holders, not UNI token holders, illustrating parasitic equity structures.

  *   **Morpho Labs:** Mentioned as a positive counter-example, moving to become a
  wholly-owned subsidiary of the Morpho Association (a shareholder-free entity) to
  ensure all value accrues to the token.

  *   **a16z (Miles Jennings):** Referenced for a piece discussing "The End of the
  Foundation Era," signaling a shift away from centralized foundation structures toward
  DAOs and new legal entities.

  *   **Hester Peirce (SEC Commissioner):** Mentioned regarding her proposed "safe
  harbor" rules for projects transitioning to decentralization.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The conversation touches on the evolving regulatory landscape, noting that the SEC
  previously lacked tools for registration but that new developments—like Hester Peirce’s
  safe harbor proposals and the **Market Structure Bill** working through Congress—are
  beginning to address disclosure needs, which aligns with the TTF’s goals.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward greater structural clarity. The TTF aims to accelerate
  the ability of good projects to communicate their quality, potentially leading to:

  1.  A reduction in the token risk premium.

  2.  More projects choosing token launches over traditional IPOs once transparency
  is established.

  3.  The obsolescence of the opaque "Foundation Era" structure in favor of more direct,
  token-aligned legal wrappers (like DAOs or shareholder-free associations).


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto/Web3 Professionals, Institutional Investors,
  Venture Capitalists, and Project Founders** who are grappling with token valuation,
  capital allocation decisions, and the structural integrity of decentralized finance.'
