    And I think, you know, the older one that has existed is, you know, what I'd call
    kind of like the IDE category, right? Of basically making you faster when your
    hands are on the keyboard, right? And that's all the tab complete and the chat
    with code base and all the tools there. And then, you know, the newer school is
    kind of this full or agentic thing, right? Running agents asynchronously in the
    background, having them take on full tasks.

    engineers must utilize both agentic and synchronous tools simultaneously.

  text: And the simple way to describe it is up until the point where the agents are
    capable enough to handle everything and let you just operate 100% in that higher
    layer of abstraction. You want to have both, right? Because you want to have agents
    for the things that they can go and take on and just do it entirely independently.
    And then you want to have the synchronous IDE experience for the things that really
    need you at the wheel.

    AI versus those prioritizing orchestration over direct coding.'

  text: There's this sort of bifurcation between, I think more traditional engineers
    who are, who are adding AI into their existing processes. And then there's like
    kind of AI-first engineers who are, who maybe only learned to code with AI or
    maybe they are senior engineers from the past, but are just like going full on
    into, into AI. And there's, there are AI-first. And they're only touching the
    code if they absolutely have to, which is a very different mindset.

summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - AI coding agents like Devon are fundamentally changing software engineering practices,
    leading to questions about the future necessity of traditional software engineers.
  - Wu suggests that AGI, based on criteria like passing the Turing test and solving
    hard technical problems, is arguably already here, though definitions remain fluid.
  - The development of AI agents follows a trajectory similar to child development,
    marked by a smooth lengthening of autonomy (the 'leash').
  - The future of programming will involve operating at higher levels of abstraction,
    moving from writing boilerplate code to expressing intent in natural language.
  - The landscape is bifurcating between engineers integrating AI into existing workflows
    and 'AI-first' engineers who primarily orchestrate agents.
  - The required skills for future engineers will emphasize deep logical fundamentals,
    problem decomposition, and architectural trade-offs, rather than esoteric syntax
    or low-level debugging.
  - The immediate future (next ~3 years) will feature a coexistence of synchronous
    IDE tools (like tab completion) and asynchronous agentic workflows, before potentially
    shifting fully to agent interaction.
  overview: This podcast features Scott Wu, CEO of Cognition Labs, discussing the
    radical transformation of software engineering driven by AI agents like their
    product, Devon. Wu shares his perspective on the evolving definition of AGI, the
    shift in programming paradigms from manual coding to agent orchestration, and
    Cognition's strategy, including the acquisition of Windsurf, in shaping the future
    of AI development tools.
