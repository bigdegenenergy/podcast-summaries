  topics: []
- impact_reason: Introduces the key technological differentiator (DLM with dynamic
    fees) and links it directly to maximizing retail LP profitability during volatile
    market conditions.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The DLM is our most well-known protocol, and that is because it is used by
    our entire community, the LP Army, to print fees. And the reason why it's very
    good helping retail print fees is that it was the first program we use with dynamic
    fees, allowing me to maximize fees in volatility.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Provides a sophisticated explanation of how dynamic fee structures
    attempt to mitigate the impact of Impermanent Loss (IL) by adjusting fees based
    on market conditions, mimicking professional market-making behavior.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The way the AMMs solves these problems with dynamic fees, which is when volatility
    increases, impermanent loss also increases, and tasks or trading fees should also
    increase. So in high volatility, mid-trires pools all increased fees while other
    passive AMMs fees might not change.
  topic: defi
- impact_reason: 'Articulates a powerful alternative investment thesis for DeFi: earning
    consistent yield from trading activity rather than relying solely on directional
    price speculation.'

    every day in sort of like a controlled manner, instead of just buying a token,
    hoping that it'll go 100x.
  topic: investment

    ecosystem focus (Solana), and platform centrality (Meteora).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We want crypto, we want the future to be tokenized, we want there to be a
    thousand different types of tokens. We want it all to be on Solana, we want it
    to be on Meteora.
  topic: Web3 vision

    Event (TGE): ensuring product maturity and infrastructure scalability to handle
    the influx of attention.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced

    a TGE? Because we know when we say TGE, right, there will be a lot of eyeballs
    that will build, a lot of people coming in. So are we ready to welcome the world
    to see what Meteora is about?
  topic: strategy/adoption

    beyond standard DeFi/meme coins toward permissioned asset creation for traditional
    capital markets, a key area of institutional Web3 interest.'
  relevance_score: 10

  text: We are at these cups of leveraging permissions, asset creation for capital
    markets. It's still moving away from permissions, asset creation for like, main
    coins.

    a community celebration and reward mechanism, not a necessary funding round, implying
    strong underlying financial health.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Meteora's the team who doesn't need to raise money. We have less revenue and
    don't need like we have like many years or one way. So TGE is a chance without
    community to eat. As Zen earlier mentioned, we have many, many stakeholders. So

    impacts valuation metrics like FDV and signals a commitment to immediate liquidity
    for the community.

    makers.

    a warning about the negative consequences of short-term price engineering on long-term
    project health.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Making the number go up is not the point of a crypto startup and shouldn't
    be, but when you see some of these tokens where they launch it a very high FDV
    and then inevitably maybe they signed some kind of predatory market making contract,
    the token dumps in six months or a year, like that's bad for everyone involved...

    for the entire ecosystem's functionality.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I still think that it's extremely important to have this very take liquidity
    layer because without that Solana or any crypto cannot function. Liquidity is
    the foundation across any other protocols or systems that's built on the chain.
  topic: technology/defi
- impact_reason: A foundational belief that spot trading (liquidity pools) is the
    non-negotiable, long-term core building block of all decentralized finance, regardless
    of trends like perpetuals or memes.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What we believe at Meteora is that DeFi will be around 20 years from now,
    and DeFi will still need a 3D post because if we do not have a spot trading, if
    you do not have the simple ability for some of the buying and sell total on on
    DeFi, then you do not have DeFi anymore.

    for a DeFi protocol, which is crucial for understanding sustainability.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The way we make money is that we help users print fees via our utility pool,
    and then we take a 5 to 20% cut on the fees that they've made. Our average takeaway
    now is about 9.7% or so.
  topic: business
- impact_reason: Explains the concept of concentrated liquidity, a key innovation
    in modern AMMs, and its benefit for capital efficiency.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Another thing about DLM is also that it concentrates the liquidity in the
    range. So we can actually set people who are launching a token can set a specific
    range. So it becomes more, what, capital efficient, you call it.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: 'A crucial clarification: dynamic fees don''t eliminate IL, but aim
    to ensure fee generation outweighs it, managing risk rather than removing it entirely.'
  relevance_score: 9

    belief in the long-term mission, not just token mechanics.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think people should care about, not about the token. People should care
    about vision and mission. They should care about what they're guiding for and
    whether they believe that whether we are the ones that make it happen.
  topic: investment
- impact_reason: Explicitly defines the token's primary role as an alignment and growth
    mechanism, rather than a direct value accrual vehicle initially.
  relevance_score: 9

    like we mentioned, there's no other margins, right, to come in so that we get
    10x the LP Army.
  topic: investment

summary: '## Comprehensive Summary of "Everything You Need To Know About Meteora''s
  Token Launch | Soju & Zen"


  This 63-minute podcast episode features an in-depth discussion with **Soju and Zen**,
  the anonymous co-leads of the Solana DeFi protocol **Meteora**, just days before
  their highly anticipated Token Generation Event (TGE) for the **MET** token. The
  conversation covers Meteora''s core technology, the leadership transition following
  a co-founder''s resignation, and the strategic vision for the project moving forward,
  emphasizing product focus and community alignment.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **Meteora protocol on Solana**, specifically detailing
  its unique market-making technology (**DLM**), its business model based on capturing
  trading fees, and the strategic rationale behind the upcoming **MET token launch
  (TGE)**, set for the 23rd. A significant portion addresses the recent leadership
  change and rebuilding community trust after a prior scandal.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Dynamic Liquidity Market Maker (DLM):** Meteora’s core innovation, which uses
  dynamic fees that adjust automatically based on volatility. This mimics the behavior
  of a market maker on a centralized exchange, allowing liquidity providers (LPs)
  to earn fees more effectively, often covering potential impermanent loss (IL).

  *   **Concentrated Liquidity:** The DLM allows token launchers to set specific price
  ranges for liquidity, making capital deployment significantly more efficient compared
  to traditional zero-to-infinity AMMs.

  *   **Product Diversification:** Beyond the retail-focused DLM, Meteora offers products
  like **DBC** and **DMM V2**, tailored for token teams and launchpads, extending
  their utility for new token launches on Solana.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **TGE as Alignment, Not Fundraising:** The MET token launch is explicitly stated
  as a mechanism for **community alignment and rewarding stakeholders** (LP Army,
  partners) rather than raising capital; the team confirmed they are not raising funds
  through this TGE.

  *   **Focus on Fee Accrual for LPs:** The core value proposition for users is earning
  consistent fees by providing liquidity, positioning it as a more active, yield-generating
  alternative to simply holding speculative assets (like meme coins).

  *   **Token Utility is Future-Oriented:** Currently, the MET token serves as a **coordination
  and alignment tool**. The team explicitly stated there are **no immediate plans
  for buybacks or direct revenue accrual** mechanisms, emphasizing mission alignment
  over token mechanics for now.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Meteora (Soju & Zen):** The current anonymous co-leads steering the project
  post-transition. Zen was previously part of the founding team before joining Jupiter.

  *   **Jupiter:** Mentioned as the prior workplace for both Soju and Zen, highlighting
  their deep experience in Solana DeFi infrastructure.

  *   **Ben Chow:** The former co-founder who resigned in February following the scandal
  involving Javier Milei''s Libra token.

  *   **Meow (Jupiter Co-founder):** Provided initial color on the leadership transition.

  *   **LP Army:** Meteora''s dedicated community of liquidity providers, cited as
  a core asset and success story.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No specific regulatory discussions were highlighted, but the context of the prior
  scandal (involving a political figure''s token) underscores the inherent political
  and reputational risks associated with high-profile DeFi projects.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  Meteora sees its future growth driven by two main vectors:

  1.  **Capital Formation on Solana:** Doubling down on attracting new users via launchpad
  partnerships (like Big Launch Sites) to tokenize assets and bring new capital markets
  onto Solana.

  2.  **Onboarding DeFi Skeptics:** Targeting existing Solana traders familiar with
  platforms like Jupiter, convincing them that LPing via Meteora is a manageable and
  profitable alternative to pure speculation.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Solana DeFi professionals, liquidity providers
  (LPs), DeFi product builders, and investors** tracking infrastructure and AMM innovation
  on Solana. It provides necessary context for understanding Meteora’s strategic pivot
  and the mechanics of its DLM technology.


  ---


  ### Comprehensive Narrative Arc


  The podcast begins by establishing the immediate context: Meteora''s TGE is imminent.
  Soju and Zen first define Meteora''s core business: creating sophisticated programs
  for swaps on Solana, primarily through their **DLM** protocol, which generates fees
  for LPs by concentrating liquidity and dynamically adjusting trading fees based
  on market volatility.


  The discussion then pivots to the **leadership crisis** that occurred six months
  prior, where co-founder Ben Chow resigned amidst controversy linked to the Argentinian
  President''s token. Zen, who returned to Meteora after time at Jupiter, details
  the stabilization phase: prioritizing community reassurance, revamping community
  structure, and refocusing intensely on **product innovation** (launching V2 and
  DBC).


  The second half focuses on the **MET token launch strategy**. The co-leads stress
  that the TGE is a "thank you" to stakeholders, not a fundraising effort. They articulate
  their vision: to make Meteora the backbone for tokenized capital formation on Solana.
  They identify their marginal user as both new entrants brought in by launchpads
  and experienced Solana traders who have yet to engage deeply with LP strategies.
  They clearly differentiate the MET token as an **alignment tool** rather than a
  mechanism for immediate value accrual or governance, signaling a commitment to building
  product utility first. The overall tone is one of resilience, strategic clarity,
  and a renewed focus on core technological strengths following a period of significant
  internal turmoil.'
