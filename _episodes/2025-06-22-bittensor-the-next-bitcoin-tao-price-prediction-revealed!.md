summary: '## Podcast Summary: Bittensor: The Next Bitcoin? TAO Price Prediction REVEALED!


  This 20-minute podcast episode from Coin Bureau provides an in-depth, updated analysis
  of the **Bittensor (TAO)** project, exploring its recent technological upgrades,
  market positioning as the "Bitcoin of AI," and offering potential price targets.
  The hosts emphasize that the analysis is educational and objective, noting that
  the Coin Bureau team does not currently hold TAO.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Bittensor (TAO)**, a decentralized machine learning network.
  The discussion centers on its technological evolution (specifically the introduction
  of subnets and dynamic tokens), its comparison to Bitcoin in the AI narrative, and
  the investment potential residing within its ecosystem, particularly its subnet
  tokens.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **EVM Compatibility & dTau:** Bittensor introduced **EVM-style smart contracts**
  in December, facilitating liquidity flow from Ethereum-based chains. The subsequent
  **dynamic Tau (dTau)** upgrade created a token for each subnet that trades against
  TAO, with emissions allocated based on the average value of these subnet tokens,
  aligning incentives similarly to the structure seen in the early days of the Velo
  protocol.

  *   **Subnet Architecture:** Bittensor operates via **subnets** (providing AI use
  cases like image generation), **miners** (performing computation), and **validators**
  (allocating TAO emissions to the most useful subnets). The future roadmap includes
  allowing subnets to **become their own independent chains**, validating Bittensor''s
  decentralized AI framework.

  *   **Decentralization Concerns:** Despite the vision, current governance is highly
  centralized, with only 10 entities voting, and initial subnet operations rely on
  a small set of validators, indicating decentralization remains a key upcoming milestone.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Price Prediction Update:** The previous prediction of $1,000 by the end of
  2025 was close (hitting ~$750). The current range is established between $200 (support)
  and $750. A breakout above $750 could target **$1,300**, with a long-term cycle
  top prediction reaching **$5,000**.

  *   **Subnet Token Opportunity:** The hosts argue that the **biggest gains will
  likely come from Bittensor''s subnet tokens**, not TAO itself, due to their significantly
  lower market caps, offering higher percentage gains on smaller investments.

  *   **Catalyst for Growth:** The primary driver for TAO price appreciation is expected
  to be **speculative demand for subnet tokens**, which are viewed as more "legit"
  than previous AI agent tokens because they have VC backing. A potential catalyst
  for a broader AI speculative wave is linked to developments like Tesla''s self-driving
  features.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **DCG/Humana:** Digital Currency Group (DCG) launched a subsidiary, **Humana**,
  explicitly to bootstrap the Bittensor ecosystem, aiming to replicate Grayscale’s
  foundational role in early Bitcoin adoption.

  *   **Co-founders:** **Jacob Steves** (co-founder) clarified that "Humana Rao" (the
  pseudonymous creator) is a collective name including himself and **Alashabana**.
  Steves is noted as a self-proclaimed Bitcoin maximalist.

  *   **VC Backers:** Early investors include **Digital Currency Group (DCG)** and
  **Polychain Capital**. **DAF 5** recently raised $222 million, potentially for subnet
  investments.

  *   **Ecosystem Integration:** **Coinbase** listed TAO in February, and **TauFi**
  launched a Uniswap V3 instance on Bittensor with a bridge to Base and Ethereum,
  signaling potential EVM liquidity inflows.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched upon the **lack of transparency** regarding insider holdings
  and token distribution. The hosts highlighted that insiders (including the OpenTensile
  Foundation) hold an estimated **20% of circulating supply**. They also noted the
  deceptive nature of the "no pre-mine" claim, as the team allegedly mined and sold
  tokens to investors post-launch (a "post-mine").


  ### 6. Future Implications

  Bittensor is positioning itself as the **blue-chip cryptocurrency within the AI
  niche**. The future trajectory depends on successfully executing decentralization
  milestones and attracting sustained liquidity from the EVM ecosystem. The project’s
  success hinges on validating its subnet model, potentially leading to an entire
  ecosystem of specialized, spin-off blockchains.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **experienced cryptocurrency investors, blockchain
  developers, and analysts** focused on the intersection of AI and decentralized infrastructure
  (Web3). It requires a foundational understanding of crypto concepts like EVM, staking,
  and tokenomics.'
