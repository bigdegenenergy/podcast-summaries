    calculation) and human qualitative assessment (moral code, team culture), defining
    the current boundary of AI utility in finance.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced

    to an IRR of 3 to 4%. Well, a person physically might come in and analyze that
    model and say, yeah, okay, it's going to an IRR of 4%. But what it's not understanding
    is the, you know, the human aspect of it is this company has a great, you know,
    moral code. It has a great atmosphere. It has a great team that works collaboratively.
    No AI system, no matter how sophisticated it is today, is going to understand
    that.
  topic: Limitations/Qualitative vs. Quantitative

    their platforms. There's actually a really interesting one that I came across
    late last year, the rat of New York called Agent Smith. They are an AI-based assistant.
    I believe they're up to four or five assistants. I haven't checked them out in
    a while, but they are doing predictive analysis. They're doing predictive analysis
    on the financial markets through SEC filings, through the EDGAR system, through
    scraping online data.
  topic: Business/Adoption
- impact_reason: Directly contrasts traditional M&A identification methods (manual
    analyst work) with the impact of AI, framing AI as a major contributor to efficiency
    gains in deal sourcing.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Predominantly, that was done by an analyst sitting in a back office for eight
    hours a day for six weeks, 40 hours a week. That is no longer the case. AI is
    solving that or I wouldn't say solving it. It's contributing to it.
  topic: Predictions/Impact
- impact_reason: Predicts the immediate expansion of AI use in finance from sourcing
    (deal flow) to deeper analytical tasks like due diligence and financial modeling.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What we're probably going to see over this next year is a lot of these platforms
    being used, not just for deal flow, but also they're going to start using it for
    due diligence. They're going to start using it for financial analysis, which is
    what we're doing right now at Roundtable.
  topic: Predictions
- impact_reason: 'Quantifies the efficiency gain: reducing due diligence time from
    1-2 months down to potentially one week due to AI assistance, illustrating massive
    productivity improvements.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So when you have that capability, imagine how much time it saves a PE firm
    to where predominantly their due diligence period might be a month or two to where
    you can cut that down to probably a week now.
  topic: Business/Impact
- impact_reason: 'Articulates a key limitation of current AI/Agentic systems: the
    lack of ''history'' and human intuition, necessitating a ''human in the loop''
    for high-stakes decision-making.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But as far as agentic changing that industry, I don't really see that because
    that's still an industry where you need what we call human in the loop. You need
    a human, of course, that has the intuition that has the history. You can't trust
    AI to have a history.
  topic: Limitations/Human-in-the-Loop
- impact_reason: Offers direct business advice against mass layoffs due to AI adoption,
    arguing that the critical thinking skills and context held by experienced humans
    are irreplaceable for financial decision-making.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So when I will say go hard against is eliminating headcount because you're
    adopting AI. That's not really the way you should go because you still need these
    humans, especially in these industries, making financial decisions to have critical
    thinking skills in AI. It just doesn't have it.
  topic: Business/Workforce Strategy

    specialized, manual accounting workflows, suggesting the shift in the CFO role
    is not brand new but accelerating.

  text: My last job I was at an AI vendor, specifically in global transfer pricing,
    which is a very, very esoteric form of global taxes, but all to say that we could
    see at the front lines of what we were doing that accounting workflows were really
    changing, and that you still had a lot of manual processes, even in esoteric spaces
    like transfer pricing, and that our CFO's role was changing overnight, and this
    is something that we could see even as far back as 2019.

    invoice processing, reconciliation) ripe for immediate automation.

    analysis and modeling to replace manual preparation time.'

    is reclaiming executive time for higher-value activities, not just process optimization.

    not just for their processes, they want their time back. They want their time
    back because their time is valuable.
  topic: business
- impact_reason: Highlights the regulatory hurdle and status for advanced financial
    AI tools, noting the SEC's 'acknowledgement' rather than formal 'approval' for
    market-facing tools.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: As far as I know, Agent Smith already has acknowledgement from the SEC. I
    don't want to say approval because the SEC never approves anything. They're acknowledging
    that they're able to work with within the SEC and say that they can do this.

    that is publicly identifiable information that they can bring into their system
    and start creating financial projections and financial suggestions within the
    market.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: Explains how AI democratizes deal sourcing by finding niche opportunities
    previously only accessible to smaller, local firms, potentially leveling the playing
    field or, conversely, attracting larger players like Bain.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: AI is scraping the internet for that stuff and it's bringing out transactions
    that normally probably wouldn't get found or wouldn't have been found by say a
    PE firm like say Bain or some of the big ones where predominantly they would have
    been found by the smaller PE firms in those local regions.
  topic: Business/Strategy
- impact_reason: A strong ethical warning regarding data scraping, emphasizing the
    need for ethical conduct, especially concerning PII, even when dealing with publicly
    available data.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But you have to do it ethically. That's one big thing. There's companies out
    there that are not doing it ethically. So if you're going to do it, you have to
    do it ethically. You can't go grab people's information on the internet, whether
    it's public or not. You know, if there's personal identifiable information, you
    know, do the right thing.
  topic: Safety/Ethics

    of context) that current LLMs cannot replicate, highlighting the enduring value
    of seasoned professionals.

  text: Or really, you know, they're showing up to your companies with 30 years of
    the context, 30 years of the history, you know, their educations, their previous
    experience, things that you can't train LLMs on overnight.
  topic: Limitations/Context
- impact_reason: A provocative statement suggesting machines could surpass humans
    in traditionally 'human' domains like empathy or art, but immediately pivots to
    reaffirming that agility remains the definitive human advantage for now.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Machines actually might be better at empathy, might actually be better at
    art. Hate to say that as a musician, but one thing they are not better at is agility
    and being able to change plans on a dime.
  topic: Predictions/Philosophical
- impact_reason: Identifies data entry and manual processing as the universal pain
    point across all company sizes (startups to Fortune 500), emphasizing the scale
    difference rather than the type of problem.
  relevance_score: 7
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: A lot right now, especially the leaders in a startup, their goal is to move
    as quickly as they possibly can. So their issue is usually they don't have the
    expertise for data entry into these ERP systems or into their accounting system.
    So their issue there is still the same as the large companies, data entry.

    You know, let's say there's a company that's, you know, they want to scrape the
    internet for all this information and they want to scrape it and dump it into,
    you know, a Snowflake database that they have. Well, that's a possibility today.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Unlocking Operational Efficiency with AI in
  Accounting Departments - with Greg Cucino of RoundTable


  This 24-minute episode features Greg Cucino, Managing Director at Roundtable Strategy
  Advisors, discussing how Artificial Intelligence is fundamentally reshaping the
  CFO role and operational efficiency within finance and accounting departments, moving
  them from historical reporting to forward-looking strategy.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **application of AI (specifically LLMs and emerging Agentic
  AI)** within **Finance and Accounting operations** to eliminate manual bottlenecks,
  enhance strategic decision-making for the C-suite (especially the CFO), and transform
  processes like M&A due diligence. The discussion heavily contrasts current **reactive
  AI** capabilities with the anticipated power of **proactive Agentic AI**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Reactive vs. Agentic AI:** Current adoption is largely reactive (e.g., using
  ChatGPT/Copilot for emails or immediate data analysis prompts). The future lies
  in **Agentic AI**, where systems proactively analyze complex data (like financial
  reports) to anticipate needs, a capability Cucino estimates is about 8–12 months
  away from widespread commercial viability.

  *   **AI in M&A Due Diligence:** AI is already being used to accelerate M&A deal
  sourcing by scraping public data (SEC filings, social media, AngelList) for predictive
  analysis and sentiment, significantly reducing the time required for initial screening
  and even complex quantitative tasks like building Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) models.

  *   **NetSuite Integration:** Roundtable leverages deep expertise in NetSuite, a
  cloud-based ERP, to streamline processes and integrate AI solutions that optimize
  business performance where data already resides digitally.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **CFO Role Shift:** AI is enabling CFOs to shift focus from analyzing historical
  data (what happened yesterday) to **forward-looking strategy** (what should happen
  next), providing near-instantaneous forecasts (e.g., cash flow projections weeks
  out).

  *   **Efficiency Bottlenecks:** Across all company sizes (from startups to Fortune
  500), the biggest pain points remain **manual data entry, invoice processing, expense
  reporting, and reconciliation**, which consume significant headcount and time.

  *   **M&A Disruption:** AI is democratizing deal sourcing, allowing smaller firms
  to potentially find transactions previously only visible to larger private equity
  firms, though this also raises competitive concerns as large firms adopt the technology
  for due diligence acceleration.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Greg Cucino (Roundtable Strategy Advisors):** Guest expert, providing first-hand
  experience on AI adoption strategies for CFOs and developing proprietary AI platforms
  for financial analysis.

  *   **Roundtable Strategy Advisors:** The sponsoring firm, specializing in CFO and
  NetSuite services, currently beta-testing AI platforms that provide C-suite analysis
  in seconds.

  *   **Agent Smith:** Mentioned as an example of an existing AI-based assistant in
  the financial sector using predictive analysis on public data, reportedly working
  within SEC guidelines to suggest market trades.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is rapidly moving toward **Agentic AI assistants** that possess deep
  contextual understanding of a company’s data, enabling proactive scenario planning
  and risk identification (like fraud or variance analysis). However, the conversation
  stresses that **human intuition, critical thinking, and industry context** remain
  irreplaceable, cautioning against the immediate elimination of headcount solely
  due to AI adoption. The next year will see these pilot programs mature into commercially
  viable, forward-facing tools.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Finance Professionals (CFOs, Controllers, Finance
  Directors)**, **Technology Leaders** implementing ERP/AI solutions, and **Venture
  Capital/Private Equity professionals** interested in how AI is changing deal sourcing
  and due diligence efficiency.'
