    sense for pretty much anyone else because that's like obviously not the reality
  topics: []
- impact_reason: Highlights a critical discrepancy between reported Fully Diluted
    Valuation (FDV) and the perceived, more relevant market valuation in crypto, which
    confuses investors.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The practical reality in crypto is that most people are just using this FDV
    number, which tells you the thing is at 50 billion when in our mind we think the
    most relevant metric is 30 billion.
  topic: investment
- impact_reason: Points out the fundamental misalignment between standard crypto valuation
    metrics (like FDV/Market Cap) and traditional finance (TradFi) accounting standards.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: In general, those metrics that you see there, they differ pretty widely from
    the way that generally these metrics would be actually measured in TradFi, like
    for equities.
  topic: investment
- impact_reason: Suggests a practical, albeit informal, method used by experienced
    investors to derive a more accurate valuation when official metrics are misleading.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The most relevant number that a lot of people like myself will use is actually
    right in the middle of that [circulating market cap and FDV].
  topic: investment
- impact_reason: Discusses the tension between ideal metric reform and the necessity
    for protocols to conform to current, flawed market standards for legibility.
  relevance_score: 7
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think some of the metrics maybe should change in crypto, you know, what
    is the headline number that like most people work with? But the practical reality
    is like most protocols like they need to work with the standards of what are the
    numbers that people are using, and kind of work within that to try to really clarify
    their accounting.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: 'Defines a key accounting problem in tokenomics: the treatment of
    authorized but unissued tokens, which inflates perceived circulating supply metrics.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Concretely, the like the kind of explicit bucketing terminology of tokens
    that we're trying to address are tokens which are authorized to enter circulation
    but are not actually outstanding supply.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Details a specific, radical accounting proposal (burning existing
    reserves vs. removing authorization for future issuance) to align metrics with
    economic reality.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: For the assistance fund, all of the Hyperliquid that is currently held in
    there, and that would be accumulated in the future, just burn all of it. And then
    for the FCR, what we said you should do, what we're proposing is just remove the
    explicit authorization for those tokens to exist, and then you also remove the
    max supply cap, such that you can still use both of the funds in those buckets
    equivalently to before. Just the difference from an accounting perspective is
    that they are now just new shares, which are just increasing the total supply.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Emphasizes that accounting cleanup is crucial for improving transparency
    and governance clarity for external stakeholders.
  relevance_score: 7
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It just makes it much more legible to outsiders and people in governance of
    like literally how many tokens are there, like who owns these tokens, how are
    they supposed to be used in the future.
  topic: business
- impact_reason: Challenges the concept of a hard max supply cap, arguing it's often
    an arbitrary, mutable number, unlike the perceived permanence in Bitcoin.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The max supply cap or equities, you know, the theoretical maximum amount of
    authorized shares, it doesn't like actually matter because it can always be changed.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Critiques the lazy adoption of Bitcoin's 21 million cap model by
    other protocols where inflationary mechanisms are necessary for long-term funding.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The problem is is that many projects in crypto have a just sort of, you know,
    baseline just how we copy-paste the thing before us. And so there ends up being
    a lot of just copying over this idea of a max supply cap when the problem is it
    made sense for Bitcoin, but it actually doesn't make sense for pretty much anyone
    else because that's like obviously not the reality.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: Draws a direct parallel between necessary token issuance for protocol
    growth and a public company issuing new equity, framing it as a standard business
    practice.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If I hit the one billion max supply cap, we decided, hey, we need more emissions,
    or there are value-accretive future incentives that we want to give out, like
    you would do that in the same way a new company would issue new shares if it was
    value-accretive.
  topic: business
- impact_reason: Describes a governance mechanism (validator quorum vote) for covering
    losses by issuing new native tokens, contrasting it with using a stable asset
    fund.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: you would be doing the exact same thing here, just the accounting is slightly
    different of instead of moving money from the assistance fund, the validator quorum
    approving that, you would just be having the exact same validator quorum doing
    the exact same decision process, but there would just be issuing new Hyperliquid
    instead.
  topic: technology/defi
- impact_reason: Highlights the inherent reflexivity risk of using a native, volatile
    asset as a backstop during a crisis, suggesting native tokens are weakest when
    needed most.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I don't think that your own native asset—I mean, like not even I think, like
    it's objectively like your own native asset carries a certain degree of reflexivity
    to it where if you're using it in a like negative situation, such as a backstop,
    it's probably the time where it's actually going to be worth the least and like
    potentially at least on a relative basis like have less value.
  topic: defi/strategy
- impact_reason: Presents a strong argument for holding stablecoins (non-indigenous
    reserves) in a treasury to cover protocol losses, mitigating native token reflexivity
    risk.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So you probably want to have a stable asset, at least in the ideal case. And
    so there's a very separate, reasonable conversation of, you know, should we have
    like USDC accumulated or USDT or USDH or like whatever in the treasury reserve
    such that we would have a stable asset to cover these things as opposed to buying
    back Hyperliquid?
  topic: defi/strategy
- impact_reason: Critiques the inconsistency and potential overestimation inherent
    in standard FDV (Fully Diluted Valuation) calculations across different platforms.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The problem with it ends up being that for like—I mean, another problem with
    it is it's calculated differently across different sites. Some use max supply,
    some use total supply. But generally, they're the most conservative overestimate
    of taking like all tokens that theoretically may exist in the future.
  topic: investment/strategy
- impact_reason: Draws a clear distinction between assets with fixed, known supply
    schedules (like Bitcoin) and those with large, unallocated treasury supplies,
    arguing the latter should be excluded from current valuation.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: In particular, like Bitcoin, you know, you like taking what is the max supply
    cap of Bitcoin makes sense because we know that we're going to get to 21 million.
    There's a designated plan to account for that supply that is going to come on
    board. Um versus in the cases where you have an FDV that has a large component
    of that which is either owned explicitly by the treasury, something like the assistance
    fund, or doesn't have a designated plan, you you should not count those in the
    valuation.
  topic: investment/strategy
- impact_reason: Defines the utility of circulating market cap as a short-term trading
    metric analogous to TradFi float, contrasting it with fundamental valuation needs.
  relevance_score: 7
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The circulating market cap is useful at times when you're just really trying
    to look at like a trading perspective of you may not even need to account—I mean,
    may not really need to account for a lot of shares that aren't going to hit the
    market soon if you're not really worried about fundamental value and you're just
    looking at a trading perspective, like literally how many shares are there for
    people to buy? And this is analogous to like float and, you know, a floating market
    in TradFi.
  topic: investment/business
- impact_reason: 'Points out a critical flaw in standard circulating market cap reporting:
    it often excludes large, imminent unlocks (like team vesting), leading investors
    to use an inaccurate metric.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The simplest example would be you could have a token where the team owns a
    bunch of tokens and they're all going to 100% unlock tomorrow and they're going
    to become fully liquid. The circulating market cap, if you go check CoinMarketCap
    or CoinGecko or whatever, won't include those, which is just very obviously like
    the wrong metric to kind of be thinking about if you're owning this token if like
    these tokens are owned and like they're going to hit supply immediately.
  topic: investment/adoption
- impact_reason: 'Proposes a concrete valuation adjustment: doubling the reported
    circulating market cap to account for known, scheduled unlocks like team allocations,
    suggesting a more realistic ''adjusted market cap.'''
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And so that is the main difference of like circulating market cap versus the
    kind of adjusted market cap that I generally use for something like Hyperliquid
    is the circulating supply something in the 15 to 20 billion dollar range, and
    like 15—what I consider to be the most relevant number is generally around double
    that because I think you need to include the team supply and stuff like that in
    there, all of that. Like those are like known tokens.
  topic: investment
- impact_reason: 'Summarizes a core principle of modern tokenomics governance: growth
    spending must be transparent and approved via governance, rather than hidden in
    large, amorphous community buckets.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Spending tokens on growth is fine, just do what transparently and justify
    it. Go to governance, argue for the supply expansion, and let holders decide.
  topic: Web3 vision/governance
- impact_reason: Critiques the uncritical adoption of Bitcoin-era tokenomics models
    (like massive community allocation) for projects that function more like traditional
    businesses.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: A lot of people just kind of copy-pasted over like, 'Hey, this is a Bitcoin
    data max supply cap,' without really digging into, 'Hey, is this actually the
    most relevant thing for us?' Another one is this kind of like there is socialism,
    social pressure type thing of we're supposed to give the community all the tokens,
    which like maybe that makes sense for certain things. Again, you know, particularly
    decentralized money like assets like Bitcoin, yeah, sure, like you want a broad
    distribution, want a bunch of people to have it. Um, if you're building something
    that looks more just like a traditional business, that's not the case.
