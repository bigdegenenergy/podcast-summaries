summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Valuation, Exits, and the Shifting Nature of Venture


  This episode of the 20VC podcast, featuring Harry Stebbings alongside venture veterans
  Jason Lampkin and Rory O''Driscoll, dives deep into several major recent financial
  and personnel shifts in the tech and investment world, framing them through the
  lens of valuation, partnership dynamics, and the increasing transactional nature
  of the industry.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Venture Capital and Private Markets Strategy**, covering
  M&A activity in the asset management space, high-profile founder departures from
  heavily funded startups, and strategic financing moves by major tech conglomerates.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Asset Manager Valuation Multiples:** The valuation of asset management firms
  (like Industry Ventures) is highly variable, ranging from 1-2% of AUM for public
  managers to 20% for firms like KKR that own all economics. Industry Ventures, being
  a secondary/fund-of-funds business, was valued appropriately around **10% of AUM**
  (approx. $700M valuation on $7B AUM).

  *   **Productizable vs. Partner-Dependent Businesses:** The ability to sell a firm
  100% hinges on its **productizability**. Firms reliant solely on the "IQ of the
  stock picker" (like a pure venture fund) are difficult to monetize fully, whereas
  businesses with strong brands, fee streams, and scalable platforms (like fund-of-funds
  or media companies) are highly monetizable assets.

  *   **Aqua-Hires at Scale:** The departure of Andrew Tulloch from Thinking Machines
  to Matter is framed as an "asset purchase" or "aqua-hire" at a multi-billion dollar
  scale, indicating a trend where large companies acquire key talent/teams rather
  than entire, complex entities.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Goldman Sachs’ Private Asset Push:** Goldman Sachs’ acquisition of Industry
  Ventures ($665M + $300M earn-out) is a strategic move to bolster its **private assets
  platform (Apex)**, allowing them to distribute high-fee private market opportunities
  to their Ultra-High-Net-Worth clients and compete against traditional private equity
  distribution channels.

  *   **SoftBank’s AI Financing Strategy:** SoftBank borrowing **$5 billion against
  its ARM holding** to invest further into OpenAI highlights the extreme capital demands
  and strategic prioritization of AI investments, even requiring leveraging core,
  recently public assets.

  *   **The Founder Dilemma (Wealth vs. Loyalty):** The $2B+ equity stake held by
  a co-founder of a $10B post-money company leaving for a reported $3.5B opportunity
  (Andrew Tulloch) underscores the tension between unprecedented wealth realization
  and traditional founder loyalty. This prompts discussion on whether founders are
  becoming overly transactional.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Industry Ventures (Hans S/Hans Morris):** Acquired by Goldman Sachs. Praised
  for building a successful, productizable asset management business over 25 years,
  especially its secondary market focus.

  *   **Goldman Sachs (GS):** The buyer, seeking to integrate Industry Ventures to
  expand its private asset distribution channels to HNW clients.

  *   **Thinking Machines & Matter:** The context for the high-profile departure of
  co-founder Andrew Tulloch, who left a company valued at $10B post-money to join
  Matter.

  *   **SoftBank & OpenAI:** SoftBank is leveraging its ARM stake to fuel further
  investment into OpenAI, signaling aggressive capital deployment in the AI race.

  *   **Arthur Rock:** Mentioned as an OG investor, serving as a benchmark for direct,
  intimidating, and highly respected early venture capital figures.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No specific regulatory discussions were highlighted, but the M&A activity (GS buying
  IV) implies standard due diligence and market acceptance of asset manager consolidation.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where:

  1.  **Asset gathering** and building scalable, productizable platforms will be crucial
  for VCs seeking high-multiple exits (via acquisition by large banks/institutions).

  2.  **Founder relationships** will require stronger contractual protections (extended
  vesting, repurchase rights) as the financial incentives for early departure become
  astronomical, leading to more transactional founder dynamics.

  3.  **AI investment** will continue to command massive, aggressive capital allocation,
  potentially forcing major players like SoftBank to use highly leveraged financing
  against existing assets.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Venture Capitalists (GPs), Institutional Investors (LPs), Technology Founders,
  and M&A Professionals** interested in the strategic valuation of VC-adjacent businesses
  and evolving founder/partner alignment issues.'
