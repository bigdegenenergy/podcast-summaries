summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Maja Vujinovic, CEO & Co-Founder of FG Nexus


  This 70-minute episode of *Searching for Mana* features host Lloyd Wohed interviewing
  Maja Vujinovic, CEO and Co-Founder of FG Nexus, focusing on the convergence of digital
  assets, institutional finance, and the transformative potential of AI. The discussion
  traces Vujinovicâ€™s unique career path from building mobile payments in emerging
  markets to her foundational role in the early days of Tether, culminating in her
  current venture, FG Nexus.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Digital Asset Treasury Management**, specifically the
  strategic decision to build a treasury vehicle around **Ethereum (ETH)**, and the
  future implications of integrating **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** with blockchain
  infrastructure (Web3). The conversation bridges traditional finance, emerging market
  challenges, and cutting-edge decentralized technology.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **ERC-404 Standard as an AI Catalyst:** Vujinovic cited the Ethereum ERC-404
  standard as a pivotal moment in changing her perspective on AI. This standard enables
  the description of **trustless, on-chain AI agents** capable of holding assets,
  interacting with DeFi, and signing transactions based on programmable logic.

  *   **AI''s Need for Faster Infrastructure:** The discussion highlighted that AI,
  particularly for complex tasks like predictive analytics and high-frequency trading,
  cannot be sustained by legacy infrastructure and requires the speed and programmability
  offered by blockchain technology.

  *   **Tokenization and Decentralized Science (DeSci):** DeSci was presented as a
  powerful, though not yet scaled, use case where tokenization allows communities
  to fund scientific research that might otherwise lack traditional traction, democratizing
  access globally.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **FG Nexus Strategy:** FG Nexus is positioned as a digital asset treasury vehicle,
  similar to MicroStrategy, which successfully raised **$200 million** in two months.
  Their strategy is entirely focused on acquiring and **staking Ethereum (ETH)**,
  aiming for a **$5 billion AUM**.

  *   **ETH vs. BTC/Other Chains:** The choice of ETH over Bitcoin or other chains
  was deliberate, driven by the belief that Ethereumâ€™s programmability and smart contract
  capabilities are essential for the next wave of institutional adoption, particularly
  in tokenization and agent-based systems.

  *   **Institutional Validation:** The successful fundraising, attracting investors
  like Citadel and .72, signals growing institutional appetite for structured digital
  asset exposure, albeit focused on specific, programmable assets like ETH.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Maja Vujinovic:** Highlighted her background in mobile payments (Africa/Latin
  America), energy project finance, and her early involvement in **Tether**, where
  she helped secure their first banking partner.

  *   **GE (General Electric):** Vujinovic shared experiences deploying early smart
  contracts using GEâ€™s real data sets, noting resistance from management when proposing
  ideas like using GE electricity to mine Bitcoin.

  *   **JP Morgan:** Mentioned their involvement in the first trade finance deal executed
  on a blockchain between JP Morgan and GE, which served as a key conviction point
  for Vujinovic regarding blockchain''s viability.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  While direct regulatory deep-dives were limited, the conversation touched upon the
  importance of **sovereign identity** and immutable records, referencing Vujinovicâ€™s
  personal experience as a refugee whose identity was tied to a state that ceased
  to exist. This underscores the need for decentralized, auditable identity solutions.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is entering a phase where **investment and
  finance** will lead blockchain adoption, moving beyond the initial hype cycles.
  The next 2-3 years are predicted to see increased integration of AI agents with
  DeFi, particularly in high-frequency trading. Long-term (15-30 years), AI is expected
  to cause a "true labor market transformation," though Vujinovic leans toward humans
  **evolving with AI** rather than mass replacement in the near term.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Finance Professionals, Institutional Investors,
  Web3 Strategists, and Technology Executives** interested in the intersection of
  decentralized finance, corporate treasury strategy, and the practical application
  of AI within blockchain ecosystems.'
