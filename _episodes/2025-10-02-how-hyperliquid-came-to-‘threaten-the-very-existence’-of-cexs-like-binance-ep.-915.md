summary: '## Podcast Summary: How Hyperliquid Came to ‘Threaten the Very Existence’
  of CEXs Like Binance - Ep. 915


  This episode of Unchained, featuring Ryan Watkins and Sunny Singh from St. Croix
  Capital, centers on the escalating competition between decentralized exchanges (DEXs),
  particularly perpetuals DEXs utilizing on-chain order books, and established centralized
  exchanges (CEXs) like Binance. The core narrative is that CEXs face their most significant
  existential threat yet as on-chain trading volumes, especially in derivatives, continue
  to grow rapidly.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**:

  The primary focus is the **DeFi derivatives market**, specifically the rise of **on-chain
  order book perpetual DEXs** (like Hyperliquid and Aster) and their direct challenge
  to the dominant revenue streams of CEXs. The discussion also covers token economics,
  market share dynamics, and the impact of token unlocks on project valuations.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **On-Chain Order Books as the Next Meta:** The shift towards next-generation
  perpetual DEXs utilizing on-chain order books is highlighted as a superior technological
  evolution compared to earlier AMM-based DEXs.

  *   **Aster''s Architecture:** Aster is noted for using an **off-chain matching
  engine** with multiple on-chain front-ends, distinguishing it from fully on-chain
  settlement models.

  *   **Open Interest (OI) as a Health Metric:** OI is presented as a crucial metric
  to balance against raw volume figures, especially when evaluating farming activity,
  as high volume with low OI suggests inorganic, short-term farming rather than genuine,
  sustained positions.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **CEX Revenue Threat:** Perpetual trading represents the single largest source
  of profit for CEXs, making the on-chain migration of this volume a multi-billion
  dollar threat.

  *   **Organic vs. Inorganic Volume:** The recent surge in Aster''s volume is largely
  attributed to its **token airdrop/points campaign**, leading to high **inorganic
  farming volume** (easy-to-farm majors like BTC/ETH), whereas Hyperliquid is seen
  as retaining stronger **organic retail flow** and deeper long-tail market activity.

  *   **Valuation Justification:** The Hyperliquid team''s execution track record
  is cited as a fundamental justification for its high valuation, contrasting with
  newer projects whose valuations might be unsustainable upon token unlock.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Hyperliquid:** The current leader in the on-chain perpetuals space, praised
  for its execution and ability to capture volume in new token listings (outperforming
  CEXs on initial trading for recent TGEs like PUMP and Plasma).

  *   **Aster (backed by YZ Labs/former Binance Labs):** The primary competitor currently
  challenging Hyperliquid''s volume lead, largely driven by its highly anticipated
  token airdrop.

  *   **Binance (CZ):** Acknowledged as recognizing the existential threat of on-chain
  trading, evidenced by their promotion of Aster and the broader industry trend of
  CEXs building their own L1/L2 solutions to stay relevant on-chain.

  *   **Arthur Hayes:** Mentioned for his initial bullish call on HYPE (126x potential)
  followed by selling his position shortly after, highlighting market volatility and
  the influence of personal liquidity needs (Ferrari deposit).


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  While not a central theme, the discussion implicitly touches on regulatory arbitrage.
  The decentralized nature of DEXs offers a structural advantage (global accessibility)
  over opaque, offshore CEXs, mitigating risks like asset seizure or opaque management
  that users face with centralized entities.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  The conversation strongly suggests that the **mega-trend is the migration of trading
  to on-chain venues** utilizing high-performance order books. CEX founders are aware
  of this and are actively trying to build their own on-chain presence or back competing
  decentralized solutions. The market is expected to become increasingly competitive
  as more capital flows into capturing the remaining 80% of the derivatives market
  share currently held by CEXs.


  **7. Target Audience**:

  Crypto investors, DeFi builders, analysts, and professionals tracking the evolution
  of financial infrastructure and the competitive dynamics between centralized and
  decentralized trading platforms.'
