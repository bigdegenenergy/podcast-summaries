    with Athena Labs.
  - Athena Labs is reportedly on a clear path to compliance with US regulations, potentially
    becoming the first regulated stablecoin developer.
  - 'The project has an automated buy pressure mechanism: $5 million daily if the
    price is above $0.70, doubling to $10 million daily if the price drops below $0.70.'
  - The recent price dip pushed Athena's RSI to extremely oversold levels, historically
    preceding sharp V-shaped recoveries.

    presents a good DCA opportunity for exposure to Athena.
