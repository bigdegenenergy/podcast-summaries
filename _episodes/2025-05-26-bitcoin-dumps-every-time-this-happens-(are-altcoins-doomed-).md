summary: '## Podcast Summary: Bitcoin Dumps Every Time This Happens (Are Altcoins
  Doomed?)


  This 50-minute episode, hosted by DZ and featuring Josh, centered on recent crypto
  market movements, particularly the underperformance of altcoins relative to Bitcoin,
  macroeconomic factors influencing crypto, and anticipation surrounding the upcoming
  Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**: Cryptocurrency markets, technical analysis (TA), macroeconomic
  indicators (M2 money supply, global liquidity), and the impact of political news
  (specifically US tariffs/Trump remarks) on crypto asset prices.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Altcoin Weakness vs. BTC Dominance:** Altcoins are currently suffering disproportionately
  during pullbacks (e.g., BTC down 3% leads to alts down 8%). Altcoin season remains
  elusive until Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) breaks its current uptrend, which has recovered
  losses seen earlier in the cycle and reached levels not seen since March 2021.

  *   **BTC Golden Cross & Pullback Expectation:** Following Bitcoin''s recent golden
  cross, historical patterns suggest a significant pullback is likely, potentially
  sweeping liquidations down to the $104k–$106k range before a push toward $115k–$116k.

  *   **Futures Gaps as Support/Resistance:** The hosts noted open CME futures gaps
  below the current price, suggesting potential downside targets for price discovery,
  though they acknowledged being wrong about gaps never filling previously.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **AI Coin Volatility:** The AI sector saw recent spikes (e.g., Virtuals AI,
  Jupiter) but has generally bled since the initial ChatGPT hype. The hosts favor
  established "blue-chip" AI projects like **Render** and **Near Protocol** over smaller,
  highly volatile tokens.

  *   **Michael Saylor''s Accumulation:** MicroStrategy (Michael Saylor) purchased
  another $427 million worth of Bitcoin at an average price of $106k, pushing their
  average cost basis just above $70k. This signals strong conviction from major institutional
  holders.

  *   **Long-Term Price Targets:** Discussion included high-end predictions for Bitcoin:
  Kathy Wood projects $1.5 million by 2030 (bear case $300k), while Robert Kiyosaki
  predicts $1 million by 2035.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy):** Highlighted for continuous "buying the dip"
  and accumulating over 580,000 BTC.

  *   **Grant Cardone & Gary Vaynerchuk (Cardone Capital):** Featured for their new
  "10x Miami River Bitcoin Fund," a dual-asset fund mixing commercial real estate
  with Bitcoin, where rental cash flows are continuously converted into BTC.

  *   **Donald Trump:** His recent decision to extend EU tariff deadlines provided
  immediate, positive relief to global and crypto markets, illustrating the sensitivity
  of markets to political rhetoric.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   The conversation touched on the political environment, noting that market reactions
  to Trump''s tariff threats are becoming predictable ("trade tensions by the dip").

  *   There was a strong critique of proposals to "tax the rich," arguing that since
  billionaires primarily hold wealth in debt/assets rather than taxable cash, such
  taxes are fundamentally ineffective.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  *   The integration of Bitcoin into traditional asset classes, exemplified by the
  Cardone Capital fund, suggests a future where real estate cash flows are systematically
  leveraged to accumulate BTC, potentially reshaping how large-scale asset management
  operates.

  *   As Bitcoin matures toward a $300k–$500k range, it is expected to behave less
  like a volatile asset and more like digital gold, with smaller percentage swings.


  **7. Target Audience**: Crypto investors, traders focused on technical analysis,
  and professionals interested in the intersection of macroeconomics, politics, and
  digital asset performance.'
