summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #1565 Jordi Visser | Bitcoin Is Front-Running
  the AI Revolution


  This episode of the Pomp Podcast features Anthony Pompliano (Pomp) in conversation
  with Jordy Visser, a 30-year veteran of Wall Street. The discussion centers on macroeconomic
  trends, the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and, most critically, the accelerating
  importance and valuation trajectory of Bitcoin as a foundational layer for the future
  digital economy.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion primarily focuses on **Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin and Stablecoins)**,
  **Macroeconomics (Interest Rates, Inflation, Debt-to-GDP)**, and the **Disruptive
  Impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI)** on public markets and labor.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin as the Base Layer:** Bitcoin is framed not as a competitor to public
  stocks (like the S&P 500) but as the **base layer of a new capital structure**—the
  "S&P 500 of the future"—disrupting incumbent public businesses.

  *   **Stablecoins as the Bridge:** Stablecoins are identified as the critical bridge
  connecting traditional finance (TradFi) transactions (which feed into GDP) with
  the emerging digital economy. Their rapid adoption by major corporations (Amazon,
  Walmart, Stripe) signals massive network effect acceleration.

  *   **AI''s Concentration Effect:** AI innovation leads to exponential growth and
  extreme concentration of wealth in a few entities (like the Mag 7), which in turn
  exacerbates wealth inequality and puts pressure on the labor share of profits.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Bitcoin CAGR Disagreement:** Visser strongly disagrees with a recent Cowen
  report that projected Bitcoin’s Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) at under 20%
  over the next five years. Visser argues that due to accelerating adoption (including
  sovereign wealth funds) and its role as a hedge against debasement, Bitcoin’s CAGR
  is likely to **accelerate** rather than decelerate as its market cap grows.

  *   **Top-Heavy Market Dynamics:** The current market feels like a bear market for
  the majority of S&P 500 companies, as performance is overwhelmingly driven by the
  "Mag 7." This concentration suggests underlying structural weakness for the median
  public company.

  *   **Tether Valuation Potential:** Visser notes the CEO of Tether suggested a potential
  valuation of **$2 trillion** for Tether based on its business performance and asset
  holdings, highlighting the massive potential of the stablecoin infrastructure.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordy Visser:** Wall Street veteran providing the counter-narrative to traditional
  institutional views on Bitcoin and AI.

  *   **Cowen Report:** A major Wall Street presentation that projected Microsoft,
  Nvidia, and Bitcoin as the top three market caps by 2030, but with a conservative
  growth rate for Bitcoin.

  *   **Mag 7:** Mentioned as the primary driver of current market performance, demonstrating
  how exponential technology breaks the law of diminishing returns for the largest
  players.

  *   **Tether (Paolo Ardoino):** Discussed in the context of massive profitability
  ($13.7B last year) and its potential valuation.

  *   **Amazon, Walmart, Stripe, Shopify, Coinbase:** Companies aggressively moving
  into the stablecoin and digital payments space, validating Visser’s thesis on stablecoin
  adoption.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Clarity for Stablecoin Act:** The passage of this act in the Senate is noted
  as a significant step toward providing a federal framework for stablecoins, further
  legitimizing and accelerating their integration into commerce.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the next five years will be a **"dystopian" and painful
  transition period** driven by AI adoption. This acceleration of labor disruption
  will increase government subsidies, further driving up the **Debt-to-GDP ratio**,
  contrary to some optimistic AI projections. Bitcoin is positioned as the direct
  beneficiary of this wealth distribution crisis, acting as a necessary hedge for
  those displaced or disenfranchised by the top-heavy AI-driven economy.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto/Web3 Professionals, Institutional Investors, Macro Strategists, and Technology
  Executives** interested in the intersection of AI, monetary policy, and digital
  asset valuation.'
