  and Response (NDR)


  This episode of *Secure Networks* features **Jack Chan, VP of Product and Field
  CTO for Asia Pacific at Fortinet**, discussing the critical role, differentiation,
  and future evolution of Network Detection and Response (NDR) solutions in complex
  enterprise environments.

  ### Key Takeaways for Technology Professionals


  #### 1. Differentiating Quality NDR Solutions

  A great NDR solution must move beyond basic detection by focusing on **data depth
  and investigation workflow**. Key differentiators include:

  *   **Data Retention and Dwell Time:** The ability to retain and query historical
  network metadata (e.g., six months back) is crucial for investigating prolonged
  attacks or lateral movement that may have gone undetected initially.

  *   **Investigative Drill-Down:** Users must be able to easily drill down into the
  collected metadata to understand the context of an alert, moving beyond simple alerts
  to actionable forensics.


  #### 2. Balancing Detection with Response Efficiency

  The industry suffers from "alarm fatigue" due to an overabundance of detection technologies
  (IPS, EDR, NDR, etc.). The focus must shift from pure detection volume to **response
  efficiency**:

  *   **Summarization:** Effective NDR must summarize complex events into human-readable
  narratives.

  *   **Integration for Context:** Solutions that integrate NDR findings with endpoint
  data (EDR) help analysts prioritize which incidents warrant immediate investigation
  by confirming cross-platform detection.


  #### 3. The Advanced Role of AI/ML in NDR

  AI and Machine Learning are no longer just buzzwords; they are essential for modern
  NDR:

  *   **Behavioral Modeling:** Advanced ML models can identify malicious traffic patterns
  (e.g., beaconing, ransomware initiation) even when attackers use novel infrastructure
  (like ephemeral Azure IPs) that are not yet on traditional threat intelligence blacklists.

  *   **Generative AI for Accessibility:** GenAI is poised to lower the barrier to
  entry for deep investigation by allowing security analysts to query complex metadata
  using natural language, reducing the need for every analyst to be an expert in advanced
  SQL-like query languages.


  #### 4. Unique Insights Beyond Firewalls and SIEMs

  NDR provides visibility where traditional perimeter and log-centric tools fail:

  *   **East-West Traffic Monitoring:** NDR excels at monitoring internal network
  segmentation and lateral movement, often leveraging SPAN ports or packet brokers.

  *   **Detecting Internal Attacks:** NDR is superior at spotting attacks like **DC
  Sync** (where an attacker tries to sync credentials from a compromised PC to Domain
  Controllers via legitimate protocols like LDAP/SMB), which firewalls and SIEMs often
  miss because the traffic appears legitimate.


  #### 5. Handling Encrypted Traffic

  With most traffic encrypted, detection accuracy hinges on advanced techniques that
  avoid performance-heavy SSL inspection:

  *   **Metadata Analysis:** NDR uses ML/AI to model encrypted Command and Control
  (C2) traffic based on characteristics like packet size, time-to-live, and connection
  intervals.

  *   **TLS Fingerprinting:** Techniques like **JA3/JA4 hashes** and the emerging
  **JARM hashes** allow NDR to fingerprint the client/server handshake to identify
  known malicious encryption profiles without decrypting the payload.


  #### 6. Threat Intelligence Integration and Alert Prioritization

  *   **Multi-Source Correlation:** A successful NDR integrates multiple threat intelligence
  feeds (e.g., VirusTotal, FortiGuard) and must have logic to **prioritize conflicting
  intelligence** ("better safe than sorry" approach when feeds disagree).

  *   **Avoiding the "Christmas Tree" POC:** Buyers should be wary of solutions that
  generate excessive alerts during Proofs of Concept (POCs). The goal is to see *fewer,
  higher-fidelity* alerts that the SOC team can actually handle, rather than being
  overwhelmed by noise.


  #### 7. Scalability and Deployment Strategy

  Scalability involves balancing on-prem compute limitations against cloud benefits:

  *   **Cloud Benefits:** SaaS offerings leverage superior cloud compute for advanced
  ML/AI processing and offer long-term data retention (e.g., one year).

  *   **Strategic Placement:** Organizations should prioritize deploying NDR in strategic
  locations where network weaknesses or high-risk activity is expected to maximize
  ROI, as increased data volume to the cloud directly impacts cost.


  #### 8. Future Evolution: Towards XDR and Human-Centric Security

  *   **NDR as an Input to XDR:** NDR will solidify its role as a core data source
  feeding into **Extended Detection and Response (XDR)** frameworks, correlating network
  events with endpoint, email, and firewall data to build a complete attack narrative.

  *   **The Human Element is Paramount:** Chan’s final advice is to step back from
  technology silos and focus on the **human element**—the starting point for most
  breaches (e.g., phishing clicks, patching delays).

  *   **Shifting Left:** Security must integrate earlier in the development lifecycle
  through **DevSecOps** practices (SAST/DAST scanning) to fix vulnerabilities at the
  source rather than relying solely on post-deployment controls like IPS.'
