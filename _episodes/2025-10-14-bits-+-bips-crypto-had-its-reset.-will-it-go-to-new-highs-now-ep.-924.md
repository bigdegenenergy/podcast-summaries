    people feel like perps are super useful and they do hedging. Sort of the longs,
    it's kind of all coins and do short, sorry, the long, I sort of BTC and do short
    on altcoins. For example, long BTC and short on Dogecoin. During the crash, due
    to the ADL, their short position was forced to close. In that case, there's no
    more sort of hedge, and due to whatever reason, glitches, or the server, whatever,
    you couldn't put bids on time.

  text: Another issue is still back to the oracle issue. A lot of these CEX, DEX,
    they are using the spot price as a mark price. And so I sometimes mention, right?
    There is basically no liquidity during the crash, and you can easily manipulate

    individually rational risk-taking leads to correlated failure and cascading liquidations
    across the system.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But I think we've gone into a situation where exchanges offer a lot of leverage
    and there's potentially a lot of traders taking on a lot of risk that oftentimes,
    you know, doesn't really come back and invite them in a big way until there's
    potentially a big like black swan event, or what happens is a lot of traders are
    taking, you know, leverage in ways that individually might seem rational, but
    then when there's a big market crash, you get like a systemic risk where everything
    gets correlated because one person gets liquidated, but then that means like the
    price goes down and like someone else gets liquidated, and that ends up liquidating
    everyone...

  text: There has been no self-regulatory organization. There's no incentive for anyone

    it returned, that's just lost a lot of money, then you'd have the heavy hand of
    government come down...

    during the crash: the unified account/cross-margin structure leading to cascading
    liquidations even on low leverage.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: One of the root causes is really about this, we call cross-margin or unified
    account. So basically all your assets are treated as a cash when you open long
    or short positions. And that means, like, even you open like sort of a 1X long
    during this kind of market crash, right? It's basically everything in all your
    positions, all your sort of assets in your unified account gone, even 1X.
  topic: DeFi/technology

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Beyond that, we also have something called this, I'm not sure whether you
    guys are doing some DeFi protocols. We have something called looping. Looping
    to get extra yield. For example, we deposit USDE, get the USDE, and then we basically,
    we can lend USDE and then we deposit USDE, get more USD. And we do this kind of
    looping to get this extra APY. It's not like this kind of perpetual. It's a lending,
    but as you can see, we can get as much as high as sort of three or five X leverage.

summary: '## Bits + Bips: Crypto Had Its Reset. Will It Go to New Highs Now? - Ep.
  924 Summary


  This episode of Bits + Bips focuses almost entirely on dissecting the extreme market
  volatility and cascading liquidations that occurred on Friday, triggered by external
  macroeconomic news (Trump''s tariff threat) and exacerbated by internal crypto market
  microstructure flaws, particularly within the perpetual futures (perps) market.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**: The primary focus was a deep dive into the **crypto market microstructure
  failure** during the recent flash crash, specifically analyzing the role of **perpetual
  futures, auto-deleveraging (ADL), oracles, and liquidity withdrawal** on centralized
  exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, and decentralized perps platforms like Hyperliquid.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Perps Vulnerability**: The event highlighted that perpetual futures, often
  used for hedging, can fail catastrophically during stress events due to forced liquidations
  (often algorithmic) that precede market maker reactions, leading to a "perfect storm."

  *   **Oracle Dependency Risk**: The second wave of liquidations appeared linked
  to the de-pegging of assets like USDE and WBETH, suggesting that reliance on specific
  exchange spot order books (rather than robust, median-based third-party oracles)
  for margin and mark price calculations created exploitable vulnerabilities.

  *   **Phantom Liquidity**: The episode drew parallels to the 2011 US equity flash
  crash, noting that automated market-making systems can create "phantom liquidity"
  that vanishes instantly during high volatility, leading to bid-ask spreads widening
  to 30% or more.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Counterparty/Exchange Risk**: The event served as a stark reminder of counterparty
  risk and exchange risk, forcing market participants to re-evaluate the safety of
  using perps for hedging, especially for delta-neutral strategies.

  *   **Liquidity Assessment**: Investors must become far more discerning about order
  book depth and true liquidity, especially for altcoins, recognizing that market
  makers automatically withdraw quotes during uncertainty.

  *   **Winners and Losers**: The discussion implied that market makers who managed
  risk well (like GSR, by not being overly reliant on perps) and potentially actors
  who exploited the microstructure gap emerged as relative winners, while leveraged
  long/short traders suffered massive losses.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Hyperliquid**: A decentralized perp platform that reportedly suffered significant
  liquidations (estimated $192M in losses/exploits) during the event.

  *   **Binance**: Central to the discussion due to its use of internal spot prices
  for collateral valuation and an announced oracle adjustment that coincided suspiciously
  with the crash.

  *   **GSR (Carlos Guzman)**: Representing a major market maker, emphasizing the
  importance of robust, multi-venue risk management beyond simple perp positions.

  *   **AllLayer (YQ)**: Provided a detailed timeline analysis suggesting the possibility
  of a **coordinated attack** exploiting the known oracle adjustment timeline on Binance.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   The discussion referenced the **US Regulation National Market System (Reg NMS)**
  from 2007, which aimed to increase competition in US equities but was later criticized
  for contributing to phantom liquidity issues seen in the 2011 flash crash—drawing
  a direct historical parallel to current crypto market structure debates.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  *   The industry needs to move towards more resilient risk management frameworks
  that do not rely solely on leveraged perps for hedging.

  *   There is a critical need for more transparent and robust oracle mechanisms,
  especially on CEXs, to prevent market microstructure hacks that exploit known pricing
  dependencies.

  *   The market is expected to "heal and move on," but participants must learn from
  this "reset" regarding liquidity and leverage accumulation.


  **7. Target Audience**: Crypto professionals, institutional investors, market makers,
  risk managers, and developers focused on DeFi infrastructure and CEX operations.'
