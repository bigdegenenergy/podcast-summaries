summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: "Bitcoin Will Hit $1 Million!" - Billionaire
  Real Estate Expert''s SHOCKING PREDICTION


  This 16-minute podcast episode features an interview with **Grant Cardone**, a prominent
  real estate developer, discussing his aggressive pivot toward incorporating Bitcoin
  into his real estate investment strategy, culminating in a prediction that Bitcoin
  will reach **$1 million within five to seven years.**


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **convergence of traditional real estate investment
  and cryptocurrency (specifically Bitcoin)**. The core theme is the creation of a
  novel investment vehicle—a **Real Estate Bitcoin Hybrid**—and Cardone''s long-term
  conviction in holding both asset classes as a hedge against traditional financial
  structures like REITs.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Blockchain Limitations for Real Estate:** Cardone spent two years exploring
  how to put real estate directly onto the blockchain but concluded that it is currently
  impractical or impossible for tangible assets like property.

  *   **Hybrid Structure Mechanics:** The strategy involves acquiring high-value,
  cash-flowing real estate (like the $235 million Blackstone asset in Boca Raton)
  and using the property''s cash flow to accumulate Bitcoin, effectively using the
  real estate as a "machine" to acquire the digital asset.

  *   **Long-Term Holding Philosophy:** Cardone explicitly rejects trading or flipping
  assets (both real estate and Bitcoin), emphasizing a disciplined, long-term "buy
  and hold" strategy, comparing his investment approach to choosing a spouse—finding
  the right one and sticking with it.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **$1 Million Bitcoin Prediction:** Cardone views the $1 million price target
  within five to seven years as **not aggressive**, suggesting it is a conservative
  expectation given the current market dynamics.

  *   **Strategic Dip Buying:** Cardone executed a significant purchase of **$30 million
  worth of Bitcoin** when prices dipped below $108, demonstrating his ability to deploy
  capital quickly during market fear, unlike public entities that might wait for Monday
  reporting.

  *   **REIT Destruction Strategy:** Cardone aims to "destroy the REIT industry" by
  offering investors a structure that avoids the mandatory 90% profit payout requirement
  of REITs, allowing him to retain capital to compound wealth through Bitcoin accumulation
  rather than being forced to distribute earnings.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Grant Cardone:** The central figure, known for his $5 billion in real estate
  assets under management (Cardone Capital), is now positioning his firm to become
  the **"largest real estate Bitcoin treasury operator in the world."**

  *   **Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy):** Cardone credits Saylor for encouraging him
  to combine real estate and Bitcoin, specifically noting Saylor’s blunt advice: "That''s
  your f-ing problem" regarding Cardone not being a public company.

  *   **Blackstone:** Mentioned as the seller of the $235 million Boca Raton asset,
  which Cardone acquired by strategically positioning himself against Blackstone in
  a bankruptcy proceeding.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion highlights a strategic avoidance of the **REIT (Real Estate Investment
  Trust) structure** due to its restrictive 1960s legislation, which mandates high
  dividend payouts, thereby limiting the ability to retain earnings for strategic
  asset accumulation (like Bitcoin). Cardone intends to take his hybrid company public,
  likely aiming for a structure that offers more flexibility than a traditional REIT.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation points toward a future where institutional capital increasingly
  bridges tangible assets (real estate) with digital assets (Bitcoin) to enhance returns
  and hedge against inflation. Cardone plans to take his combined real estate/Bitcoin
  operation public, signaling a new category of publicly traded investment vehicles
  that prioritize Bitcoin accumulation over traditional real estate distributions.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto Investors, Real Estate Professionals,
  Institutional Investors, and Financial Strategists** interested in macro asset allocation,
  corporate treasury strategies involving Bitcoin, and innovative hybrid investment
  structures.'
