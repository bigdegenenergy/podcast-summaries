  source: llm_enhanced
  text: immediately after pre-training, models are actually a bit unwieldy. If you
    take really pure, pure pre-training and you try a model immediately after, it's
    not going to be very interactive with you. It's not going to be chatty, it's not
    going to answer your questions necessarily in the way that you expect.

- impact_reason: Defines the purpose of post-training as the alignment phase necessary
    to make models useful for specific applications.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This led to the development of a second phase in model training, which is
    called post-training. And the idea of post-training is to kind of hone in and
    sharpen the model to really fit how it's going to be used, which typically means
    making it a good chat assistant or something like that.

    DeepSeek R1, and was verifiable rewards, you know, where essentially the model,
    you know, solves the mathematics problem or submits an answer to a mathematics
    problem, and then that answer gets evaluated. And if it's right, that's a positive
    signal. If it's wrong, that's a negative signal.
  topic: technical/trends

    writing) and pivots to RLIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback) as the scalable
    solution for complex NLP tasks.

    could be writing a report or it could be like pretty much any natural, a lot of
    natural language tasks. And this is where I think in terms of scalability and
    access that has been really, really successful as well as RLIF, where you use
    AI feedback. So feedback from another model.

    (pure prediction) with the interaction complexity of RL, explaining why RL deployment
    is harder.

  text: One of the reasons pre-training scales so fast, because pre-training is very
    simple. It's very straightforward. You have this like huge batch of tokens, you

    now you have all of these environments, all of these other models that you interact

    of this conversation is made of about 10 turns. So you are looking at, you know,
    nearly a million messages. And during the reinforcement learning process itself,
    we explore, you know, multiple possibilities. So for each of these messages, you
    know, we might explore five, ten, you know, possible answers, which gets rewarded
    by judges. So at the end, you are looking from, you know, less than 100 human

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: 913: LLM Pre-Training and Post-Training 101,
  with Julien Launay


  This 75-minute episode features Julien Launay, co-founder and CEO of Adaptive ML,
  providing a deep dive into the methodologies behind creating and refining Large
  Language Models (LLMs), specifically contrasting the **pre-training** and **post-training**
  phases. The discussion moves from foundational AI training concepts to the cutting-edge
  role of reinforcement learning (RL) in modern model refinement and the commercial
  implications for enterprise AI.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on the **lifecycle of Large Language Model (LLM) creation**,
  detailing the distinct stages of **Pre-training** (foundational knowledge acquisition)
  and **Post-training** (alignment and specialization). Key technical concepts covered
  include various forms of Reinforcement Learning (RLHF, RLEF, RLAIF) used in post-training,
  and the shift in compute allocation between these two phases.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **The Evolving Training Paradigm:** Historically, pre-training (predicting the
  next token on massive web data) consumed the vast majority of compute. However,
  modern models (like Grok) are spending nearly as much on post-training, indicating
  a massive scaling up of alignment and refinement efforts.

  *   **Plurality of Reinforcement Learning Signals:** Post-training is increasingly
  driven by sophisticated feedback mechanisms beyond traditional Human Feedback (RLHF).
  These include **Execution Feedback (RLEF)**, where models are rewarded based on
  verifiable outcomes (e.g., passing code tests, solving math problems), and **AI
  Feedback (RLAIF)**, where a specialized model evaluates outputs, offering scalable
  alternatives to human annotation.

  *   **Verification vs. Generation:** A core principle discussed is that **verification
  is often easier and more scalable than generation**. Models can be highly effective
  at checking the correctness of another model''s output (RLAIF/RLEF) even if the
  initial human data used for comparison contains significant "noise" (low inter-rater
  agreement).


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Enterprise Customization via Adaptive ML:** Launay’s company, Adaptive ML,
  focuses on making fine-tuned models easily accessible for enterprises using smaller,
  cost-efficient models, suggesting a market trend toward specialized, rather than
  monolithic, foundation models.

  *   **The Value of Post-Training Data:** The increasing investment in post-training
  signals that the competitive edge is shifting from simply having the largest pre-trained
  model to having the most effective, aligned, and specialized model, often achieved
  through proprietary, high-quality feedback loops.

  *   **Scalability of Synthetic Data:** The success of RLAIF and RLEF demonstrates
  a viable path for companies to generate massive amounts of high-quality training
  data internally, reducing reliance on expensive, slow human annotation pipelines
  for alignment.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Julien Launay:** Guest, Co-founder/CEO of **Adaptive ML**, bringing expertise
  from **Hugging Face** and **Light On**.

  *   **Grok (xAI):** Mentioned as a recent example demonstrating the power of extensive
  post-training and reinforcement learning to achieve high benchmark scores (e.g.,
  on law exams).

  *   **Annotation Companies (Scale, Surge):** Referenced in the context of traditional
  RLHF data sourcing, highlighting the limitations of human scalability.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a future where **post-training is as critical, if
  not more so, than pre-training**. This shift implies that innovation will increasingly
  focus on creating scalable, automated, and verifiable feedback environments (RL
  environments) to continuously tune models for specific tasks, moving beyond the
  initial, broad knowledge acquisition phase.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI/ML Engineers, Data Scientists involved
  in model deployment, AI Product Managers, and Technology Strategists** interested
  in the practical engineering and commercial realities of building and aligning state-of-the-art
  LLMs for real-world applications.'
