  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Someone gets something that is super tailored to their specific environment
    without having to pre-pay or like no commitment, no cost involved until they actually
    feel business value.
  topic: Business Model
- impact_reason: 'Explains the compounding effect of their platform strategy: initial
    investment in generic capability (e.g., document parsing) yields 95% reuse across
    diverse use cases.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We built it [the unstructured data capability] so generically that now when
    a financial statement in Excel came in, or a CV, or an image-type use case, we
    already have like 95% of those capabilities, and we just need to change the last
    few and then put it into the library of building blocks that we have available...
  topic: Technology/Platform Strategy
- impact_reason: Illustrates the power of building generic, foundational capabilities
    early on, enabling rapid adaptation (95% reuse) to entirely new data types and
    use cases (real estate docs to financial statements to CVs).

    of those capabilities...
  topic: technology/platform strategy
- impact_reason: Provides a staggering, concrete example of the AI execution backlog
    in large enterprises, proving the necessity of external, scalable solutions over
    internal engineering efforts.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: My backlog currently is 1,670 use cases that the business has brought to me
    that I have to execute on by the end of 2026. So, I could have as many internal
    engineers as I possibly wanted; I will never get them done in-house. So, I need
    a scalable approach.

    the challenge Unframe is attempting to solve, validating the need for their specific
    model.

  topic: industry trends/AI failure rates
- impact_reason: 'Provides a clear framework for the 80/20 build/buy split: buy for
    speed/quick wins; build for core IP and strategic differentiation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: 'I think most cases like this are probably the 80/20 rule: buy the things
    that you need to get quick impact on your business—stuff that is simple use cases,
    maybe quick wins—those things. But what you could consider building, and I totally
    understand when you want to build that in-house, is anything that has IP ownership
    concerns, you want to increase your strategic positioning, things like that.'
  topic: business/build vs buy
- impact_reason: A strong warning about the speed of AI evolution, arguing against
    internal builds for non-core functions due to rapid obsolescence.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: AI moves so fast. By the time that you launch something in-house, it's best-in-class
    on that day, but the following week, I can promise you there's a new model, there's
    new AI capability, new research that has come out. It's probably already outdated
    again, right?
  topic: technology/AI pace
- impact_reason: Reiterates the absolute necessity of pre-defined, structured KPIs
    as the foundation for measuring AI success, regardless of the implementation partner.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If people want to have successful AI projects in their organizations, they
    need to be clear on what the KPIs are upfront. So, whether that's cost or time
    or accuracy, they need to have that clearly structured so that whether they're
    working with Unframe or whether they're doing this on their own, how do they know
    the project is a success unless those KPIs are defined up front?
  topic: business/KPIs
- impact_reason: Provides a benchmark example of an ideal, highly prepared customer
    who has quantified success metrics (96% accuracy, 90% completeness), contrasting
    with past unstructured experimentation.

    the fundamental dilemma in enterprise AI adoption (build vs. buy).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: 'It''s the perennial question: should you build or buy your AI solution? Well,
    what if you could have your cake and eat it too?'
  topic: Technology/Strategy
- impact_reason: A strong philosophical statement arguing that AI necessitates a complete
    re-evaluation of established business processes, not just incremental improvement.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Challenges we can, because with AI, it's kind of everything has been reset.
    Like, we were rethinking everything that we've done the same way forever, and

    used to achieve speed and customization, a key insight for platform builders.

  text: We built an AI platform that is made up of hundreds of different building
    blocks. So, we looked at all of the most complex, the most challenging, the most
    time-consuming problems that enterprise leaders face when building and deploying
    AI solutions. We packaged it...

    where they'll build it for you totally custom... and then you can try it. And

    You won't find that, but at Unframe, you can.
  topic: Business Model
- impact_reason: 'Actionable advice for enterprise AI adoption: prioritize business
    outcomes (ROI/KPIs) over simply deploying available technology.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What we're really pushing for is for them to start with the ROI and the KPIs
    in mind. So, what are you actually trying to achieve? Not just like which tech
    do you have at your fingertips that you could use.
  topic: Strategy/Business
- impact_reason: 'Addresses a major pain point in enterprise consulting/implementation:
    hidden service fees. Their model bundles tailoring into the subscription.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: All of our services and our AI product leaders that work on the specific tailoring
    of the solution, everything is included in our subscription. So, you don't have
    any hidden costs, no additional charges that just pop up that you never planned
    on having.
  topic: Business Model

    operational efficiency (AIOps), leading to measurable improvements like reduced
    resolution time.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What we gave them is like a one-pane-of-glass where they can see all of the
    correlation between the different tools made by AI. So, for them, a lot less manual
    work... reducing time to resolution of all their tickets...
  topic: Technology/Operations
- impact_reason: Emphasizes the critical role of founder involvement in early-stage,
    novel business models for continuous product-market fit refinement and platform
    evolution.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It sounds like one or both of you are still involved in some way or other
    with the sales cycle to all of your clients. And now I can see why that helps
    you identify what are the next Lego building blocks that Unframe needs to build...
  topic: Startups/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Highlights the strategic decision-making process for platform development:
    avoiding direct competition with established SaaS tools while focusing on building
    reusable, foundational components (''Lego blocks'') for repeatable enterprise
    needs.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We're probably not going to build them another Slack, right? But there are
    actually a lot of use cases where we see a lot of repeatability, and that's where
    those Lego blocks, the building blocks of our platform, come back in.
  topic: technology/startups
- impact_reason: Emphasizes the critical role of founder involvement in early-stage
    sales for identifying unmet needs that directly inform the next set of platform
    building blocks.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This partly explains to me why it's so important that you and your co-founder,
    Shy, are involved in founder-led sales still today... because it sounds like,
    'Oh wow, I actually three times this week, I heard a client say that there's this
    new kind of thing that they need,' and so maybe that's a good place for us to
    move next.
  topic: business/startups
- impact_reason: Defines a strategic shift from transactional vendor relationships
    to long-term strategic partnerships focused on continuous AI value realization
    across multiple use cases.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The idea on Unframe is really not just to try to maximize returns on a single
    use case, but then feeling value and coming back for use case number two and three
    and four and so on. And that's the partnership we want to build. We don't want
    to be just a vendor; we really want to be there to execute on AI strategy with
    our customers.
  topic: business/strategy
- impact_reason: Directly challenges the guest to reveal the methodology for achieving
    success in AI projects, given the high failure rate cited.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: 'That report was gold. You''ve commented on the report, but then how to answer
    my question: How do you pick projects or how do you pick KPIs, business indicators
    that you know are going to be a success? How do you get in that 5%?'
  topic: business/AI strategy
- impact_reason: Identifies organizational adoption and internal buy-in as crucial
    factors for AI project success, beyond just technical feasibility or potential
    impact.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We really try to drill down with our AI strategists and like, which one has
    business impact? Where does the budget, where does the team actually buy into
    the idea? Because, you know, you can have as much business impact if you're the
    team that you're building towards is reluctant to change in that regard, is not
    going to adopt the solution, you're not going to move the needle for your business.
  topic: business/change management
- impact_reason: Offers a pragmatic, balanced view on the build vs. buy decision for
    large enterprises, rejecting the binary choice.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Realistically, at an enterprise level, it's probably going to be both [build
    or buy]. You can't possibly be building everything; it's not possible. But also,
    maybe you shouldn't be buying everything either.
  topic: business/technology strategy
- impact_reason: 'Articulates the core value proposition: achieving the customization
    of ''build'' with the speed of ''buy,'' delivering ROI rapidly.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced

    the outcome, getting that ROI in weeks instead of years on some particular functionality.
  topic: startups/value proposition

    to their use case.
  topic: business/delivery speed
- impact_reason: Raises a significant governance and risk concern regarding the proliferation
    of unmanaged, autonomous AI agents built by business units without IT oversight.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Or you have all these agent builders. That is fantastic, but for what? It
    doesn't matter. We just need to give them something as the IT department, and
    they can build their own agents. I'm like, 'Do you really want to give them something
    when you don't know what they're going to do? You're going to have hundreds or
    thousands of agents that are not maintained, that are doing autonomous actions
    inside your business. You're highly regulated.'
  topic: technology/AI governance
- impact_reason: 'Quantifies the efficiency gain from platformization: only 5% customization
    needed for new use cases, maximizing reusability.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We already have like 95% of those capabilities, and we just need to change
    the last few and then put it into the library of building blocks that we have
    available and can use it again tomorrow and the day after for any other enterprise
    customer.

    that AI disruption allows for non-linear growth strategies.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced

    to focus. You can't start with doing something for multiple personas and multiple
    industries and multiple products from day one.'

    builds immediate trust with potential enterprise clients.

    (POCs), ensuring they are targeted and impactful.

    and say, 'We want to build one or two or three different POCs with you, but let's
    try to find the one that actually moves the needle...'

- impact_reason: 'Accurately identifies the hybrid model: Productized services or
    ''SaaS-enabled services,'' which is a growing trend for complex AI solutions.'
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Unframe is kind of mixing both services and SaaS kind of together. It sounds
    like you have lots of different AI platform options for your clients that are
    kind of ready to go, but then you customize them.
  topic: Business Model
- impact_reason: A strong statement on the obsolescence of 'one-size-fits-all' enterprise
    software in the age of specialized AI needs.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We think that is very important right now because we've moved so far beyond
    this moment of generic software, like it's one size fits none.

    cutting-edge consumer AI experiences and lagging enterprise software.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We're just seeing this hype around AI everywhere. Like ChatGPT came and the
    world changed all of our personal lives. But then we're like, how are we still
    working with business software that does not really give us the same experience?

    to manually correlate...
  topic: Business/Technology
- impact_reason: 'Identifies a massive, common enterprise data problem: valuable insights
    trapped in unstructured, legacy document repositories.'
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We do a lot of that [contract management], and think about contracts in real
    estate... HR businesses... legal MSAs, all kinds of contracts where we abstract
    data because with many businesses that we see right now, they want to see the
    trend of their agreements, their expiration dates at scale, but everything just
    sits in a scanned PDF somewhere in a SharePoint folder.
  topic: Technology/Data Management
- impact_reason: A strong endorsement of advanced LLMs (Claude) highlighting their
    capability to synthesize complex information quickly, drastically reducing research
    time from days to minutes.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What stands out for me most about Claude is how it seems to intuitively know
    exactly what I'm looking for. When I'm doing research for a podcast episode...
    Claude uses built-in web search and extensive behind-the-scenes reasoning to bring
    me a magnificent, accurate, and well-cited report. What would have taken me days
    is now done in minutes.
  topic: technology/AI tools
- impact_reason: Gives specific examples of non-core functions where buying is superior
    to building, focusing on the long-term maintenance burden.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you're talking about your IT ticketing system or knowledge base search,
    marketing content generation, do you really need to build that and have this backlog
    and have your internal developers maintain that for the rest of their lives? It's
    probably not necessary, and you would be significantly more cost-effective and
    faster to just buy it, in my opinion.
  topic: business/cost efficiency
- impact_reason: Details a crucial tactic for working with highly regulated industries
    (like finance/healthcare) to demonstrate value quickly without immediate, risky
    production integration.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We can work with dummy data; we can mimic integrations so they can actually
    see how everything works, and only at a later point try the full integration.
    We're flexible in that regard, but it really is a matter of days, and that's the
    cycle we operate in.
  topic: business/regulated industries

    generators) that lack the robustness required for enterprise scale.
  relevance_score: 8

summary: '## Summary of Super Data Science Podcast Episode 932: Build vs. Buy in the
  Age of AI with Larissa Schneider (Unframe)


  This episode of the Super Data Science podcast, hosted by John Cron, features Larissa
  Schneider, Co-founder and COO of Unframe, a startup that has raised $50 million
  to revolutionize enterprise AI deployment. The central theme is challenging the
  traditional "build vs. buy" dichotomy for AI solutions by offering a hybrid model
  that delivers the speed of buying with the customization of building.


  ### 1. Main Narrative Arc and Key Discussion Points


  The conversation centers on Unframe''s novel **Managed AI Delivery Platform**, which
  leverages hundreds of pre-built, reusable "Lego brick" components. This approach
  allows them to rapidly tailor complex AI solutions to specific enterprise needs,
  promising ROI in weeks rather than years. A key differentiator is their **no-commitment,
  no-cost Proof of Concept (POC)** phase, contingent only on the customer realizing
  measurable business value. This model directly addresses the high failure rate of
  enterprise AI projects (citing the MIT/NAND group report showing 95% failure to
  show value).


  ### 2. Major Topics, Themes, and Subject Areas Covered


  *   **AI Solution Delivery Models:** Comparing traditional build (slow, custom,
  high overhead) vs. buy (fast, generic, low customization).

  *   **Unframe''s Hybrid Model:** Described as a blend of services and SaaS, offering
  tailored solutions built from standardized components.

  *   **Business Impact Focus:** Emphasizing the necessity of starting with clear
  ROI and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) rather than just exploring available technology.

  *   **Enterprise AI Use Cases:** Categorized into Observability/Reporting (BI, search),
  Extraction/Abstraction (unstructured data from contracts, financials), and AI Workflows/Automation.

  *   **Founder-Led Sales:** The importance of founders remaining involved in sales
  to identify repeatable patterns and guide the development of new platform "Lego
  blocks."


  ### 3. Technical Concepts, Methodologies, or Frameworks Discussed


  *   **Lego Brick Architecture:** A modular approach where complex AI capabilities
  are broken down into generic, reusable building blocks that can be quickly assembled
  and customized.

  *   **Business Impact Analysis:** A structured upfront process to define measurable
  success metrics (KPIs) before development begins.

  *   **Handling Unstructured Data:** Specific mention of extracting value from legacy
  documents like contracts, financial statements, and PDFs using abstraction techniques.

  *   **IT Operations Correlation:** Using AI to correlate data across disparate enterprise
  tools (ServiceNow, JIRA, Datadog) to reduce manual effort and time-to-resolution.


  ### 4. Business Implications and Strategic Insights


  *   **Speed to Value:** Unframe drastically cuts deployment time, moving from deep
  dive workshops to production-ready solutions in days, which is critical given how
  fast the AI landscape evolves.

  *   **De-risking AI Investment:** The "pay only when you see value" model significantly
  lowers the barrier to entry and addresses executive fears about sunk costs in failed
  POCs.

  *   **Scalability Challenge:** Large enterprises (like the Wall Street bank mentioned)
  face backlogs of thousands of potential AI use cases that internal teams cannot
  possibly handle, necessitating scalable external partners like Unframe.

  *   **Build vs. Buy Strategy:** The general advice is to **buy** for quick wins
  and non-core functions (e.g., marketing content, ticketing search) and **build**
  only for core IP or strategic competitive advantage (e.g., core banking systems).
  Unframe positions itself as the "perfect middle ground."


  ### 5. Key Personalities, Experts, or Thought Leaders Mentioned


  *   **Larissa Schneider:** Co-founder and COO of Unframe.

  *   **John Cron:** Host of the Super Data Science podcast.

  *   **Shy:** Co-founder and CEO of Unframe (previously co-founded NoName Security).

  *   **NAND Group (MIT):** Referenced for the report detailing the high failure rate
  of AI projects.

  *   **Claude (Anthropic):** Mentioned in a sponsor segment as a powerful AI collaborator
  for research and strategy.


  ### 6. Predictions, Trends, or Future-Looking Statements


  *   AI necessitates a fundamental reset in how enterprise software is built and
  delivered, moving beyond "one size fits none."

  *   The pace of AI innovation means in-house solutions risk becoming outdated almost
  immediately after launch.

  *   The future of enterprise AI adoption relies on scalable, partnership-based execution
  rather than isolated internal projects.


  ### 7. Practical Applications and Real-World Examples


  *   **IT Operations:** A Fortune 10 insurer uses Unframe for a single pane of glass
  to correlate logs and tickets across their entire tech stack, drastically improving
  resolution times.

  *   **Contract Management:** Abstracting data from large volumes of contracts (leases,
  MSAs) stored in SharePoint to provide scalable insights on trends and expiration
  dates.


  ### 8. Controversies, Challenges, or Problems Highlighted


  *   **AI Project Failure Rate:** The industry standard of 95% of AI projects failing
  to deliver value is the primary problem Unframe seeks to solve.

  *   **Executive Pressure vs. Strategy:** Many leaders rush to execute on AI without
  defining clear KPIs, leading to wasted resources on non-impactful POCs.

  *   **Agent Proliferation Risk:** Concerns about business leaders building thousands
  of unmaintained, autonomous agents without proper governance, especially in regulated
  industries.


  ### 9. Solutions, Recommendations, or Actionable Advice Provided


  *   **Define KPIs Upfront:** Whether building or buying, success hinges on clearly
  structured metrics (accuracy, completeness, cost reduction,'
