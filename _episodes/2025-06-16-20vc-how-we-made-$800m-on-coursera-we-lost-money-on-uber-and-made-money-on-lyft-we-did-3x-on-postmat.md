summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: How We Made $800M on Coursera | Larry Aschebrook
  @ G Squared


  This episode features Harry Stebings in conversation with **Larry Asherbrook, Founder
  and Managing Partner of G Squared**, detailing his unconventional and highly successful
  journey in venture capital, marked by significant wins, notable losses, and a unique
  investment philosophy centered on secondary market access and concentration.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Venture Capital and Private Market Investing**, specifically
  focusing on the strategy of **secondary direct investing** (buying shares from existing
  private shareholders), portfolio construction, navigating market cycles, and the
  importance of operationalizing a differentiated firm strategy.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Early Secondary Direct Value Proposition:** In the early 2010s (post-2008
  crisis), being a secondary direct buyer provided significant value, often securing
  shares at **35 cents on the dollar** compared to primary buyers, due to a lack of
  liquidity options for early shareholders.

  *   **Micro-Transaction Data Advantage:** G Squared leverages frequent, smaller
  transactions (micro-transactions) in secondary deals to gain **primary-level data
  and touchpoints** with founders/companies, which acts as a "Trojan horse" to identify
  when to triple down (e.g., in Wiz).

  *   **Concentration Strategy:** Asherbrook favors high conviction, concentrating
  risk: **90% of their risk is typically held in just 10 companies** across a vintage,
  driven by the need for velocity of capital return for early LPs.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **The Extended Private Market:** The thesis underpinning G Squared''s start
  was the observation that companies were staying private longer (average age to IPO
  increased from ~3 years pre-2010 to ~15 years currently), creating an opportunity
  for secondary liquidity providers.

  *   **DPI Over MOIC:** Asherbrook explicitly states that **DPI (Distributions to
  Paid-In Capital) is king, and MOIC (Multiple on Invested Capital) is "BS,"** emphasizing
  the critical need for LPs to see actual cash returns, especially for first-time
  managers needing to prove track records.

  *   **Differentiation is Mandatory:** In today''s crowded VC landscape, simply being
  a seed or growth-stage fund is insufficient; firms must differentiate their business
  model (e.g., G Squared’s focus on media/content alongside investing).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Larry Asherbrook (G Squared):** The central figure, detailing his start from
  fundraising for endowments, investing his own money (including retirement funds)
  into early private shares (Twitter, Uber), and building a $5B+ AUM firm.

  *   **Coursera:** A massive success, returning **$800 million to LPs** from this
  single holding.

  *   **Major Portfolio Wins/Losses:** Significant money made on **Lyft** and **3x
  return on Postmates in 18 months**. Losses were incurred on **Uber** and **Getir/23andMe**.
  **Spotify** represented 40% of the third fund, requiring a difficult pivot and additional
  capital raise to protect the position.

  *   **Theranos:** Asherbrook successfully sued to **exit an investment** in Theranos,
  though he notes still losing millions elsewhere due to poor judgment calls.

  *   **Key Founders Mentioned:** Jack Ma (Alibaba) and Daniel Ek (Spotify).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched upon the regulatory differences in the US for direct secondary
  buying, noting that firms engaging in this activity at scale often need to be **regulated
  similarly to a hedge fund**, which G Squared has adopted.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that future successful VC firms must be highly differentiated,
  leveraging unique access points (like secondary markets) and focusing intensely
  on generating real cash returns (DPI) rather than just paper valuations (MOIC).
  The ability to maintain founder relationships and data access while operating at
  scale remains crucial.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Venture Capital professionals, Fund Managers (especially emerging managers), Institutional
  Investors (LPs), and Private Market Strategists** seeking candid insights into building
  a successful, differentiated fund structure.


  ---


  ### Comprehensive Summary Narrative


  Larry Asherbrook of G Squared shared an extraordinary narrative detailing his transition
  from academic fundraising to managing over $5 billion in venture capital, emphasizing
  radical honesty about both his triumphs and failures. His entry into VC was entirely
  unconventional: starting with his own money (including cashed-out retirement funds)
  after a divorce, he began buying shares in nascent tech companies like **Twitter,
  Uber, and Spotify** directly from classmates and contacts, using a simple, self-created
  one-page transfer form.


  The initial thesis was built on the **extended private market**, anticipating that
  companies would stay private longer, creating an arbitrage opportunity for secondary
  buyers who could secure shares at favorable valuations. His first fund ($35M deployed
  over three years) saw massive momentum from early secondary purchases, most notably
  from **Alibaba** (bought from Jack Ma’s family office via a connection made through
  an alum). Asherbrook attributes early success to a "go big or go home" mentality,
  leading to high concentration in winners like Alibaba, Spotify, Palantir, and Twitter,
  while acknowledging he also bought "flaming bags of turds" (like certain clean tech
  investments).


  A critical strategic insight shared was the **importance of velocity and DPI**.
  Because early LPs demanded quick returns, Asherbrook focused on fewer, high-conviction
  bets where he could force liquidity, contrasting sharply with the modern environment
  where many managers raise massive funds quickly without proving cash'
