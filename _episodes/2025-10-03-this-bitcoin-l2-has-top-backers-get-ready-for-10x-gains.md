- impact_reason: Outlines a specific filtering methodology for identifying 'quality'
    crypto projects based on minimum market capitalization ($100M minimum).

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We need to start laying down some filters to find the quality project. So
    first thing we need to do is look at the valuation. We don't want some of these
    tokens that we changed by 24-hour price change. Yeah, some of this $18 million
    market cap, $5 million market cap. I don't have any interest in these projects.
    So we need to make the market cap minimum $100 million.

    not interested in what Binance Labs, now called YZI Labs, I'm not interested in
    what they invested in 2021. Like I said, I want to see what they're interested
    in today, the things they're looking at recently.

    going to be EVM capabilities. It's got a Bitcoin node wrapped with the EVM smart
