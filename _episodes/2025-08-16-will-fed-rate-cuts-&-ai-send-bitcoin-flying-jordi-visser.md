    absolutely not be academic and data-driven off things of the past, but have a

    in most deflationary technology of all time, which is not the internet, which

    for bond yields and asset valuation.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: they've basically raised the inflation target from 2% to say 3%. And the reason

  text: Is it as simple as saying if we already are at all-time highs, if unemployment
    is where it is, if GDP growth is where it is, and they start to cut, we should
    expect asset prices to just explode higher? And AI is a tailwind, interest rate
    cuts are a tailwind. Like all of this is just one big trade where asset prices
    and this reflation idea are going to drive everything significantly higher.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Will Fed Rate Cuts & AI Send Bitcoin Flying?
  | Jordi Visser


  This 47-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast, featuring Jordi Visser, dives deep into
  the confluence of macroeconomic policy (Fed actions, inflation data), technological
  acceleration (AI), and the resulting impact on asset prices, particularly Bitcoin
  and global equities.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Macroeconomics and Crypto/Traditional Finance Intersections**.
  Key themes include the Federal Reserve''s interest rate trajectory (specifically
  potential September cuts), the reliability of inflation data (CPI/PPI), the massive
  productivity impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and how these factors are justifying
  current high global asset valuations, especially for Bitcoin.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **AI Adoption Phases & Measurement:** AI is moving from the infrastructure stage
  into the **adoption phase**, where productivity gains (especially in profit margins)
  are not being accurately captured by traditional metrics like GDP or payroll data.

  *   **The "Digital Worker Economy":** The rise of AI agents means economic activity
  and "job growth" are occurring in a digital sphere that traditional economic data
  (like unemployment reports) completely misses, leading to inaccurate readings of
  economic health.

  *   **Bitcoin Volatility Dynamics:** Recent sharp moves in Bitcoin are attributed
  to short-term trading overreactions (algos and retail) reacting to macro news, though
  overall realized volatility is declining, suggesting stabilization despite news
  shocks.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Reflationary Boom Justification:** Global markets (DAX, FTSE, NIKKEI, S&P
  500) are rising because the market is pricing in a **reflationary boom** driven
  by AI productivity and expected central bank easing, rather than a traditional inflationary
  environment.

  *   **Earnings as the True Indicator:** Despite bearish soft data (consumer confidence,
  uncertainty), corporate earnings growth (11% YoY for S&P 500) is proving to be the
  most reliable metric, suggesting traditional economic models are failing to account
  for AI''s impact.

  *   **Fed Cuts as a Tailwind:** If the Fed cuts rates in September (which Visser
  believes is highly likely, driven by White House signaling and weakening labor data),
  it will confirm the beginning of a cutting cycle, which is massively bullish for
  assets like Bitcoin and gold, as the implied inflation target is effectively being
  raised to 3%+.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordi Visser & Anthony Pompliano (Pomp):** Hosts/Guests driving the core analysis
  on macro and crypto strategy.

  *   **Scott Besson:** Mentioned for his commentary suggesting the Fed should adopt
  a forward-looking, non-academic mindset similar to Alan Greenspan, focusing on future
  AI impacts rather than lagging data.

  *   **Janet Yellen (Treasury Secretary):** Her contradictory comments regarding
  buying Bitcoin highlighted the sensitivity and short-term trading nature of the
  crypto market.

  *   **Hyperscalers:** These companies are central to the AI trade, benefiting from
  infrastructure spending and subsequent cloud revenue as the adoption phase accelerates.

  *   **Figure:** Mentioned in the sponsor segment as a major non-bank mortgage lender
  leveraging crypto assets (BTC/ETH) for lending with improved rates and decentralized
  custody solutions.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Implied Policy Shift:** The discussion suggests the White House is signaling
  a desire for lower rates and a hotter economy, effectively raising the informal
  inflation target to 3%+.

  *   **UBI and Wealth Concentration:** AI-driven productivity gains are concentrating
  wealth in asset owners, creating a de facto form of UBI through rising asset values
  and government transfer payments, which may necessitate future policy rebalancing
  (e.g., addressing housing affordability).

  *   **Long-Term Rates Concern:** While the Fed might cut short-term rates, the market
  may keep long-term rates elevated, which requires government intervention (like
  yield curve control or tax breaks) to ease borrowing costs for consumers.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is heading toward a period where **traditional
  economic data becomes increasingly unreliable** for forecasting asset performance.
  Investors must pivot to focus on earnings growth driven by technological adoption
  (AI) and anticipate central banks accommodating a higher baseline inflation rate.
  Bitcoin is positioned to benefit significantly from this reflationary environment
  and potential monetary easing.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Investment Professionals, Macro Strategists, and Sophisticated Crypto Investors.**
  The discussion requires a strong understanding of Fed policy mechanics, inflation
  metrics, and the structural shift driven by AI adoption.'
