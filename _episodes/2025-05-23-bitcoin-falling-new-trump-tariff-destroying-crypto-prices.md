    that tariffs were intended to lower the yields. Yellen undid the decline in yields,
    so basically, then it went down, but then it went immediately back up.

    having the dinner—he''s what? Going to go to the dinner and everyone''s just going
    to give him so much adulation, he''s like, "I''m more bullish on crypto." I think

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Bitcoin Falling: New TRUMP Tariff Destroying
  Crypto Prices


  This 66-minute episode of *Discover Crypto* hosted by DZ, featuring guests Josh
  and TJ, centered on recent market volatility driven by political events, primarily
  former President Trump''s statements, alongside technical analysis of Bitcoin and
  a deep dive into the disruptive potential of new AI technology.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**:

  The primary focus was **Cryptocurrency Markets (Bitcoin and Altcoins)**, analyzed
  through the lens of **Macroeconomic and Political Events** (specifically Trump''s
  proposed tariffs and trade war rhetoric). A significant secondary focus was the
  rapid advancement and implications of **Generative AI (Google V03)**.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Bitcoin Price Action**: Despite a sharp, tweet-induced pullback from near
  $111k, the market found a bottom (around $107k) and is viewed as undergoing a "healthy
  little correction." Key support levels to watch were identified around $105k, with
  major fear-inducing futures gaps noted much lower around $96k.

  *   **M2 Money Supply Correlation**: Bitcoin''s recent price action, including the
  sharp dip and immediate correction, was shown to be tracking almost perfectly with
  the correlation to the M2 money supply, suggesting fundamental monetary policy influence.

  *   **Altcoin Season Potential**: A weakening Bitcoin dominance chart suggests that
  if BTC rejects current resistance levels, a significant move to the upside for many
  altcoins could follow.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Trump Tariff Impact**: Trump’s threat of a 50% EU tariff and 25% Apple tariff
  caused immediate risk-off sentiment, leading to sharp drops in Bitcoin and stock
  futures, though markets showed signs of recovery.

  *   **Macro Strategy**: The hosts theorize that Trump''s trade war rhetoric is a
  strategic maneuver ("3D chess") intended to create recessionary fears, thereby pressuring
  the Fed (Powell) to cut interest rates, which ultimately benefits asset prices like
  Bitcoin by devaluing fiat.

  *   **Bitcoin as Hedge**: The core investment thesis remains that continuous fiat
  printing across administrations guarantees asset inflation; thus, Bitcoin is positioned
  as the ultimate exit strategy from the depreciating dollar.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Donald Trump**: Central figure whose tweets directly impacted market volatility.

  *   **Janet Yellen**: Her subsequent comments on trade deals appeared to counteract
  the yield-lowering effects of Trump''s tariff threats.

  *   **NEAR Protocol**: Highlighted as a strong L1 project with an integrated AI
  narrative, predicted to easily reclaim all-time highs.

  *   **H100 Group AB (Swedish Firm)**: Gained 37% on only a $490k Bitcoin purchase,
  illustrating the disproportionate positive market reaction to small corporate BTC
  acquisitions.

  *   **Juicy Holdings (Chinese EV Seller)**: Announced plans to acquire 1,000 Bitcoin
  over the next year.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   **Texas Bitcoin Reserve**: Governor Greg Abbott''s move to establish a strategic
  Bitcoin reserve in Texas was cited as further evidence of institutional and state-level
  bullish adoption.

  *   **Trade Policy & Rates**: The discussion heavily linked political trade policy
  (tariffs) directly to bond market yields and Federal Reserve rate cut expectations.

  *   **IP and Deepfakes**: The rise of hyper-realistic AI video generation (V03)
  raised concerns about propaganda and the potential need to address intellectual
  property rights in an age of easy digital replication.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  The conversation suggests a future where **AI technology will be massively disruptive**
  to creative industries, requiring significant energy infrastructure and potentially
  leading to unprecedented levels of disinformation. On the financial front, the hosts
  are highly confident in **Bitcoin''s long-term trajectory** ($200k, eventually $1M)
  due to the inescapable nature of fiat currency expansion.


  **7. Target Audience**:

  This episode is most valuable for **Active Crypto Traders and Investors** who need
  timely analysis linking political events, macroeconomic indicators (yields, M2),
  and specific crypto price action, as well as **Tech Strategists** interested in
  the immediate implications of cutting-edge generative AI.'
