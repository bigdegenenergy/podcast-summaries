    on autonomy and goal-seeking behavior, contrasting it with scripted tools.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: An agent is an AI that goes out, it builds its own solutions, and you just
    give it a task. You give it a goal. You give it an end destination. You make sure
    that it has the tools that it needs, the information that it may require as well...
    And then it goes out and it builds its own way to the solution.

    or RPA, emphasizing dynamic pathfinding over static scripting.

    so many of these quote unquote agents that were exposed in the Gartner study...

    must possess: advanced reasoning, independent multi-step planning, long-term memory,
    and real-world tool integration.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: real agents have advanced reasoning. They can plan multiple steps ahead independently
    without human guidance. True agents don't need workflows built for them. What
    they need, they need memory systems that learn and can remember context across
    long conversations and tasks, and true agents integrate with the tools and systems
    to take actions in the real world.

    required for a truly functional, human-equivalent agent.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: An agent has a start point, has an end point, and the agent finds everything
    else out in between. And it has access—in most cases, a useful agent, at least—has
    access to a virtual browser, has access to a virtual desktop, has access to a
    command line tool like Terminal on Mac, right?

    likely due to the 'agent washing' problem and mismatched expectations.

    'real agents,' contrasting them with lower-quality vendor offerings.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: more than 15% of decisions, day-to-day work decisions, are going to be made
    by agents by 2028, I think that's actually a giant number, right? Again, I think
    it's going to be more because I think that the big tech companies, specifically
    Microsoft and Google, they've already, they've laid their cards out. They're going
    all in on real agents, unlike a lot of these vendors that are pushing a bunch
    of garbage.

    are merely AI-powered workflows (like those built on platforms like N8N), not
    autonomous agents.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: EP 582: No, that’s not an AI Agent. Cutting through
  the Agentic AI marketing hype


  This episode of the Everyday AI Show is a "Hot Take Tuesday" dedicated to debunking
  the massive marketing hype surrounding "AI Agents." The host argues that the vast
  majority of products currently branded as AI agents are, in reality, just rebranded
  chatbots or pre-built marketing automation workflows with a superficial layer of
  AI.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Agentic AI Hype vs. Reality**. The discussion centers on
  defining what constitutes a *true* AI Agent versus what is being deceptively marketed
  as one (a phenomenon the host calls "agent washing" or "the over-agentification
  of everything"). It also covers the implications of this marketing deception on
  business investment and project success rates.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **True Agent Definition:** A genuine AI Agent is defined as an AI that is given
  a goal/end destination and the necessary tools/information, and then autonomously
  **builds its own solution path** without relying on pre-built decision trees or
  workflows.

  *   **Required Capabilities:** A useful, true agent must have access to tools equivalent
  to a human worker, such as a **virtual browser, virtual desktop, or command-line
  tools** (like Terminal), allowing it to adapt and interact with the real world.

  *   **Agentic vs. Agent:** There is a critical distinction between **agentic AI**
  (referring to the underlying models, like GPT-4o or Gemini 1.5 Pro, which possess
  advanced reasoning) and an **actual Agent** (a complete system capable of autonomous,
  multi-step planning and execution).


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Market Deception:** The host claims this marketing trend is the "biggest tech
  marketing scam since the dot-com bubble," citing a Gartner study revealing that
  **over 95% (130 out of 3,000+)** vendors claiming to offer AI agents do not actually
  possess true agent capabilities.

  *   **Investment Risk:** Businesses investing in these non-agent solutions are building
  on "shaky ground." Gartner predicts **over 40% of current agentic AI projects will
  be canceled by the end of 2027** due to using inadequate technology or being based
  on these false premises.

  *   **Strategic Guidance:** Decision-makers should be cautious about relying on
  startups in this space. The host advises that successful enterprise adoption of
  true agents in the near future will likely be centered around the offerings of the
  **Big Five** major tech players (OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, and potentially
  Anthropic).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Gartner:** Their research is central to the episode, exposing the massive
  discrepancy between agent marketing claims and technical reality.

  *   **The "Big Five":** **OpenAI, Microsoft (Copilot Studio), Google (Agent Space/Project
  Mayari), Meta, and Anthropic** are identified as the players most likely to deliver
  viable, general-purpose agents that enterprises should focus on.

  *   **Windsor (Cautionary Tale):** Mentioned as an example of a promising startup
  (in the vibe coding space) that ultimately dissolved after its leadership was acquired,
  illustrating the risk of building critical processes on smaller, non-trillion-dollar
  market cap companies.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward a future where true agents will handle significant
  operational load. Gartner predicts that by **2028, over 15% of day-to-day work decisions
  will be made by autonomous agentic AI**, and more than a third of enterprise software
  applications will embed generative AI. However, the current hype cycle is delaying
  this progress, leading to widespread disappointment and skepticism among businesses
  that invest in false solutions.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI/Tech Professionals, Business Leaders, Enterprise
  Decision-Makers, and Investors** who are actively evaluating or investing in AI
  automation solutions and need a clear, technical framework to differentiate genuine
  agent technology from marketing fluff.'
