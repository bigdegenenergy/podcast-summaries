  topic: Investment/Strategy
- impact_reason: Provides a critical analytical caveat for interpreting central bank
    gold buying data, suggesting that price appreciation, not just net buying, inflates
    the percentage figures.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: When you look at central bank gold reserves as a percentage of reserves, it
    shows them going up, but it doesn't adjust them for the gold price. So their percentages
    have gone higher, but that's because when gold's up 60-plus percent in a year,
    well, then no other currency reserves are moving that much.

  text: I think it's more likely that people are going to be very, very angry with
    gold by the time we get a year from now. And it's not that I think it's going
    to collapse. It's just that a lot of this is retail, a lot of this is momentum.
  topic: Investment
- impact_reason: Provides a historical counter-example showing that negative real
    rates and QE do not guarantee gold appreciation, cautioning against simplistic
    macro correlations.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think they should go back and look at 2010 to 2016 because QE was happening.
    We had negative yields around the globe. And if you owned gold from like 2010
    to 2016, it was a horrible asset to own, even though we had negative real rates,
    even though we had QE going on.
  topic: Investment/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Articulates Bitcoin''s dual nature: it acts as a fear trade (like
    gold) but, when fear subsides, it correlates with risk assets like stocks, driven
    by accelerating AI adoption.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Bitcoin fits in is if people aren't worrying as much, then Bitcoin goes with
    the other side, which is stocks. And that's why I'll say again, I believe stocks
    will be higher next year because the AI situation that people are going is not
    only accelerating, it's picking up a pace...

    powers, framing the current financial transition as a conflict between two monetary
    paradigms.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: China is not too happy about the stablecoin thing. Europe's not too happy
    about the stablecoin thing. This just means that the capital flow argument that
    all of these great historians have said is taking shape with the old framework
    of gold and the new framework of stablecoins.
  topic: regulation/adoption
- impact_reason: Labels the current environment where fiscal needs (Treasury debt
    issuance) override monetary policy (Fed QT) as 'fiscal dominance,' a key concept
    in modern macro analysis.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is part of fiscal dominance. This is what you have to understand.
  topic: strategy/regulation
- impact_reason: 'Explains *why* the Fed is forced to halt Quantitative Tightening
    (QT): the massive need for the Treasury to issue debt creates an unavoidable liquidity
    crunch that the Fed must accommodate.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Jerome Powell said this week, we're probably going to have to stop QT. So
    for everyone out there, the bottom kind of freaking out. The problem is, guess
    what? You got the Fed, QT, they're buying the bonds from the Treasury, and the
    Treasury needs to issue lots of debt... And so this puts pressure under the Fed.
    And that's why they can't let the runoff happen anymore.
  topic: regulation/investment

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Bitcoin Crashed: Why I''m Still Buying | Jordi
  Visser


  This 55-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast features host Anthony Pompliano (Pomp)
  interviewing macro investor Jordi Visser. The central theme revolves around Visser’s
  continued aggressive buying of Bitcoin despite recent market panic, contrasting
  this with broader macroeconomic fears, the perceived failure of the traditional
  Bitcoin four-year cycle, and the critical role of US-China trade dynamics, particularly
  concerning rare earth minerals.


  **1. Focus Area:**

  The discussion centers on **Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)**, **Macroeconomics**, **Market
  Sentiment**, and **Geopolitical Risk (US-China Trade)**. Specific sub-topics include
  the Bitcoin halving cycle, AI market narratives, credit contraction fears, and the
  strategic importance of rare earth minerals.


  **2. Key Technical Insights:**

  *   **Bitcoin Cycle vs. Macro Correlation:** Visser notes that Bitcoin has recently
  failed to exhibit its expected high beta against traditional markets, suggesting
  the traditional four-year halving cycle might be temporarily overridden or synchronized
  with the broader macro cycle (e.g., Fed policy, S&P earnings).

  *   **AI Narrative Dominance:** The current market narrative is overwhelmingly dominated
  by the AI boom, leading to the creation of localized "bubbles" (e.g., in zero-revenue
  energy names), but Visser argues the overall AI acceleration is underestimated.

  *   **Gold as a Fear Trade Indicator:** The correlation between gold buying and
  specific geopolitical/default fears (like JGB yields) suggests gold acts primarily
  as a fear hedge, whereas Bitcoin might align more closely with risk-on assets (stocks)
  when macro fears subside.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle:**

  *   **Aggressive Bitcoin Accumulation:** Visser explicitly states he is "buying
  Bitcoin all the way down to 100," viewing the current dip as an opportunity created
  by market participants selling ahead of the perceived four-year cycle peak.

  *   **The Post-Cycle Thesis:** Visser believes that once Bitcoin breaks through
  previous all-time highs, the "four-year cycle belief" will be invalidated, removing
  a major psychological overhang for future price action, similar to how equity markets
  mature beyond specific seasonal beliefs.

  *   **Skepticism on Gold''s Near-Term Performance:** While long-term bullish on
  gold, Visser suggests that if a US-China deal materializes, gold could underperform
  next year as the "fear trade" subsides, potentially leading to retail disappointment.
  He favors non-Mag 7 stocks and AI infrastructure names for the coming year, assuming
  the Fed cuts rates.


  **4. Notable Companies/People:**

  *   **Jordi Visser:** The guest, a macro investor who is aggressively buying Bitcoin
  despite current market fear.

  *   **Anthony Pompliano (Pomp):** Host, emphasizing the need to learn from interesting
  people and noting his own investment firm''s disclaimer.

  *   **Michael Howell:** Mentioned for his chart illustrating the four-year cycle
  of monetary policy expansion and collapse.

  *   **Keith Orboy:** Referenced for correctly timing the 2021 market top based on
  the Fed''s shift in monetary policy signaling (raising rates vs. cutting rates in
  the dot-com bubble).


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  *   **US-China Trade & Tariffs:** The critical discussion point is the ongoing trade
  negotiation, particularly the leverage China holds via **rare earth minerals**.

  *   **Rare Earths as Geopolitical Leverage:** Rare earths are essential for nearly
  all modern electronics, cars, and military hardware. China controls the mining and
  processing (due to the toxicity of the process), giving them significant bargaining
  power against the US, which Visser believes is the most critical factor in the current
  geopolitical tension. A deal here is seen as a major market catalyst.


  **6. Future Implications:**

  The conversation suggests a bifurcation in market drivers:

  1.  **Macro/Geopolitical:** The resolution of the US-China trade conflict (especially
  rare earths) will likely trigger a shift away from fear-based assets like gold and
  toward risk assets like equities and potentially Bitcoin.

  2.  **Technological:** The AI acceleration is underestimated, suggesting strong
  performance for related infrastructure stocks, regardless of broader macro health.

  3.  **Bitcoin Maturation:** The industry is moving past reliance on the four-year
  cycle, indicating a shift toward a more mature asset class whose price action will
  increasingly correlate with global liquidity and risk appetite rather than internal
  supply shocks alone.


  **7. Target Audience:**

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Investors (especially long-term Bitcoin
  holders)**, **Macro Hedge Fund Managers**, and **Professionals tracking US-China
  geopolitical risk and supply chain vulnerabilities.**'
