    (hundreds of thousands of lines) to minimal smart contract code (tens/hundreds
    of lines). This is a core value proposition for enterprise blockchain adoption.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What JP Morgan's piloting here is using the efficiency of this new platform
    that we're building on-chain on Base to make it so you can translate those hundreds
    of thousands of lines of code into tens or hundreds of lines of code denominated,
    defined in smart contracts to make the big run more efficiently...

    10x-100x efficiency, cost reduction, and global reach.'

    as a new platform that lets them be 10 to 100 times more efficient, lets them
    be much cheaper, and lets them be much more globally available—that's the theme
    of this moment, and that's the theme of what Base is enabling for all these businesses
    around the world.
  topic: Strategy/Adoption
- impact_reason: 'Pinpoints the technological inflection point: low-cost L2s and abstracted
    wallet UX are the missing pieces that make enterprise adoption feasible now.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But the reality is that back in 2015, the technology wasn't ready. But now
    the technology is ready. We have ultra-low-cost, fast, usable blockchains like
    Base. We have really good wallet infrastructure that makes it so all of this can

    required to achieve true global adoption, emphasizing that current TPS is insufficient
    for the 'world computer' vision.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Where we're going from here is we're going to 10x, and then we're going to
    10x again, and then we're going to 10x again. Because in order to serve the sort
    of scale that we're talking about when we say "bring the world on-chain," we have
    to be serving tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of transactions a second.
  topic: Technology/Scalability
- impact_reason: Crucially distinguishes institutional deposit tokens (permissioned)
    from public stablecoins (permissionless), clarifying the regulatory and access
    boundaries of this specific innovation.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is a permissioned use case, right? It's not a fully permissionless stablecoin
    where any consumer can go and buy it and use it. But it is a great example of
    how JP Morgan is using this technology platform to solve a real problem that they
    have...
  topic: Regulation/Technology
- impact_reason: A direct quote from a key JPM executive arguing for the superiority
    of regulated deposit tokens over existing stablecoins based on scalability and
    fractional banking alignment.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Malala... told Bloomberg, "From an institutional standpoint, deposit tokens
    are a superior alternative to stablecoins because they are based on fractional
    banking, we think it's more scalable."
  topic: Regulation/Investment
- impact_reason: This clearly articulates the core problems of traditional finance
    (TradFi) infrastructure—slowness, inaccessibility, and lack of openness—setting
    the stage for why decentralized infrastructure is necessary.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think that the way I look at this is that we spent the last 100 years building
    a lot of really important financial infrastructure that makes our world work today...
    But there are a few big problems with that infrastructure that we've built. One
    is it's still very slow and inefficient; it's mostly built with legacy systems
    that are slow-moving, hard to improve, hard to build on top of. Two, it's pretty
    siloed in terms of who can access it... And three is, it's not very open, so it's
    hard for other people to actually build on top of it.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: A crucial insight arguing against a zero-sum competition between
    different tokenized assets (like stablecoins and deposit tokens), suggesting they
    will coexist based on their utility.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: When I think about kind of like stablecoins versus deposit tokens, I don't
    think we have to choose either-or. I think we can look at these and be like, okay,
    one of them is a one-to-one, almost cash-like equivalent. The other looks a lot
    more like our traditional banking system. Both of those have really, really valuable
    roles in the economy.
  topic: DeFi/Adoption
- impact_reason: This is a grand vision statement, predicting the tokenization and
    on-chain migration of *all* existing business and governance infrastructure, not
    just payments.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I don't think it's going to just stop with deposit tokens or stablecoins.
    I think we're at the dawn of people realizing, 'Oh my God, every single piece
    of financial infrastructure, every single piece of governance infrastructure,
    every single piece of business infrastructure that we built over the last 50 years,
    we can now bring that to this new platform and use the strengths of this new platform
    to make all of those things that are good even better.'
  topic: Web3 Vision
- impact_reason: A strong prediction on the normalization of stablecoin usage, comparing
    it to the mandatory adoption of internet payments.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think what's going to happen over the next year is that we're just going
    to see the pace of this accelerate, where it almost becomes normal for everyone
    to have a stablecoin strategy. We're not going to be talking about it every single
    time a new business starts doing things with stablecoins; it's just going to become
    like the internet, where if you're not accepting stablecoins, it's like if you
    weren't accepting internet payments—something is wrong, and that's weird...
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: This demonstrates a massive leap in user experience for DeFi, abstracting
    complex, multi-step on-chain actions (wrapping, depositing, withdrawing) into
    a single, seamless, user-friendly transaction initiated within a familiar application
    (Coinbase). This is key for mass adoption.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So now you can get a USDC loan against your Bitcoin in the Coinbase app. Instead
    of it doing any off-chain stuff, it's all fully on-chain. When you click a one-tap
    button, you don't sign a big form; you instead sign a transaction.
  topic: DeFi/Adoption
- impact_reason: This is a concrete example of advanced smart account/sequencer technology
    enabling complex, multi-protocol DeFi interactions (borrowing against wrapped
    BTC collateral on a Layer 2) to be executed atomically and seamlessly for the
    end-user. This is the future of UX in Web3.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why JPMorgan and Shopify Are Rolling Out New
  Products on Ethereum Layer 2 Base - Ep. 855


  This episode of Unchained features Jesse Pollock, Head of Base and Coinbase Wallet,
  discussing the significant real-world adoption of the Base Layer 2 network by major
  institutions like JPMorgan and Shopify. The central theme is the maturation of blockchain
  technology, making it finally ready to deliver on the long-held promise of making
  traditional business infrastructure 10x to 100x more efficient.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **real-world enterprise adoption of Ethereum Layer
  2 technology (specifically Base)** for improving core business operations in **Finance
  (JPMorgan)** and **Commerce (Shopify)**, moving beyond speculative crypto use cases
  into fundamental efficiency gains.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Smart Contract Efficiency:** JPMorgan’s JPMD (USD Deposit Token) pilot replaces
  legacy, off-chain settlement systems involving "thousands or hundreds of thousands
  of lines of code" with streamlined on-chain smart contracts requiring only "tens
  or hundreds of lines of code," drastically improving efficiency.

  *   **Base Scalability Milestones:** Base has scaled its compute capacity (gas per
  second) approximately 20x in 18 months, moving from 2.5M to 35M gas/sec. While the
  resting throughput is currently 100-150 TPS, burst capacity has reached nearly 2,000
  TPS (e.g., during Friend.tech events), with plans to scale toward tens of thousands
  of TPS.

  *   **Seamless Consumer Abstraction:** Coinbase is leveraging smart accounts and
  batched transactions to abstract complex on-chain actions (like wrapping Bitcoin,
  lending, and withdrawing USDC) into single, seamless "one-tap" buttons for end-users,
  exemplified by their Bitcoin-backed loan product.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **The "Blockchain, Not Bitcoin" Thesis Realized:** The industry is finally seeing
  the realization of the early 2015 vision where blockchain technology improves backend
  financial systems, driven by ready infrastructure (low-cost L2s, better wallets).

  *   **Deposit Tokens vs. Stablecoins:** JPMorgan views its deposit token (JPMD)
  as a superior, scalable alternative to stablecoins for institutional use because
  it is based on fractional banking principles, though both asset types are expected
  to coexist with distinct roles.

  *   **Accelerating Enterprise Adoption:** The public announcements by Shopify, Stripe
  (via B2B acquisition), and JPMorgan have created a "wake-up call," pushing skeptical
  businesses to actively seek stablecoin and on-chain strategies to lower fees and
  expand globally.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jesse Pollock (Head of Base and Coinbase Wallet):** The primary guest detailing
  the technical and strategic rationale behind Base adoption.

  *   **JPMorgan (Onyx Unit):** Launching **JPMD**, a USD deposit token for institutional
  clients on Base to streamline internal settlement.

  *   **Shopify:** Rebuilding its commerce stack on-chain using Base to process USDC
  payments more efficiently for its merchants.

  *   **Malala (Global Co-Head of Onyx Blockchain Division):** Highlighted for stating
  deposit tokens are superior to stablecoins due to fractional banking scalability.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched on the regulatory context implicitly through the distinction
  between permissioned institutional products (JPMD) and permissionless stablecoins.
  The seamless integration of on-chain actions within the Coinbase app (like the Bitcoin
  loan product) suggests a strategy of building compliant, fully on-chain financial
  primitives that fit within existing regulatory frameworks while leveraging blockchain
  efficiency.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests the industry is moving toward a **unified global
  economy** where the boundary between the "crypto economy" and the "off-chain economy"
  dissolves. Within the next year, accepting stablecoin payments is predicted to become
  standard practice, similar to accepting internet payments today. The focus will
  shift from *if* businesses should adopt this technology to *how* they can implement
  it to solve existing operational problems.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto/Web3 Professionals, Institutional Finance
  Strategists, and Enterprise Technology Leaders** interested in the practical, large-scale
  application of blockchain technology beyond DeFi speculation.'
