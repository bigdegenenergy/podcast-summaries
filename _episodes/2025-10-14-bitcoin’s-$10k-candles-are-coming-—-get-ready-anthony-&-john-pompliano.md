    that's when Bitcoin actually does pretty well. But in the reaction to news, Bitcoin

    people panic. News breaks, sell. What do you sell? What's liquid? What's open?
    Bitcoin's the only thing available to sell.
  topic: technology/investment

  text: There's no circuit breakers. Why do they have circuit breakers? They're manipulating

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Bitcoin’s $10K Candles Are Coming — Get Ready


  This 50-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast, featuring Anthony Pompliano and John
  Pompliano, centers on analyzing recent market volatility in both traditional finance
  (TradFi) and Bitcoin, arguing that underlying structural changes in monetary policy
  and investor behavior favor continued asset appreciation, especially in crypto.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)**, analyzed through the lens of
  **Macroeconomics, Geopolitics, and Investment Strategy**. Secondary themes include
  the behavior of the stock market, the impact of Federal Reserve policy, and the
  evolving nature of asset valuation in the current economic regime.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin Liquidity Clearing:** The recent sharp drop in Bitcoin''s price (from
  $121k to $108k) was viewed positively as it "wiped out all the excess leverage"
  from the market, clearing the way for higher prices.

  *   **24/7 Market Advantage:** Geopolitical events occurring outside of traditional
  stock market hours (like over the weekend) highlight Bitcoin’s 24/7 trading nature,
  attracting users seeking immediate liquidity and responsiveness when TradFi markets
  are closed.

  *   **Dollar-Denominated Volatility:** The market vernacular focuses too much on
  absolute dollar moves (e.g., "$2,000 move") rather than percentage changes, masking
  the fact that large dollar swings (like a potential $15k-$20k daily move) will soon
  represent relatively small percentage moves as Bitcoin’s market cap grows.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Retail "Buy the Dip" Reflexivity:** The current generation of retail investors
  understands market reflexivity better than previous ones, leading to rapid buying
  pressure immediately following sharp dips, which shortens bear market durations.

  *   **The Fed''s Playbook:** The Federal Reserve will not tolerate prolonged bear
  markets (defined as 18+ months). Any significant market downturn will trigger aggressive
  monetary stimulus (the "monetary bazooka") to prevent recessionary conditions, effectively
  capping downside risk for asset owners.

  *   **Maturity Threshold:** Bitcoin is currently in its "teenage years." It will
  only be considered a truly "mature" asset (like a "grown man or woman") when its
  market capitalization crosses the **$10 trillion** threshold, at which point institutions
  and central banks will fully adopt it.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump:** Mentioned for his use of social media (specifically Friday
  afternoon announcements) to manipulate market sentiment and negotiate geopolitically.

  *   **Howard Marks (Oaktree):** Cited as a respected value investor who recently
  expressed a surprisingly bullish stance, stating he does not believe the market
  is currently in a bubble or facing an imminent crash.

  *   **Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan):** Referenced as another figure acknowledging the current
  environment as a bull market.

  *   **Palantir:** Used as an example of modern corporate efficiency, where CEOs
  are now touting growth alongside *decreasing* employee count, signaling a shift
  toward maximizing revenue per employee.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion heavily implies that government intervention (the Fed''s playbook)
  prioritizes asset price stability over currency purchasing power. The hosts argue
  that the Fed has effectively violated its historical promise to the public by prioritizing
  asset owners through quantitative easing (QE) and artificially suppressed interest
  rates, leading to significant dollar devaluation (30% loss of purchasing power in
  five years, according to TrueFlation data).


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where asset prices are structurally supported
  by central bank intervention, making long-term "buy the dip" strategies highly effective
  for asset owners. Bitcoin''s role as a 24/7 liquid asset will continue to draw capital
  away from traditional, time-restricted markets, especially as tokenization expands.
  The industry is moving toward greater efficiency, where productivity gains (revenue
  per employee) are valued over sheer headcount growth.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Investors, Macro Strategists, and Active Retail Traders.** Professionals
  needing a quick pulse on the prevailing bullish sentiment in crypto and the macro
  arguments used to dismiss recession fears would find this most valuable.'
