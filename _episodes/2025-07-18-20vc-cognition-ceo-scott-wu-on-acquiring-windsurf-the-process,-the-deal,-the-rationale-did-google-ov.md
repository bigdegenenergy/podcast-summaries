    It sounds insane to say, but that's really what RL is converging on, which is
    basically if you have a clean enough set of here exactly the behaviors that I

    what it means to succeed or fail, you can just train a model that does that.

    skill.

    understand what's going on into it, to debug and diagnose. And I think that is

summary: '## 20VC: Cognition CEO Scott Wu on Acquiring Windsurf: The Process, The
  Deal, The Rationale


  This episode of 20VC features Harry Steppings in conversation with Scott Wu, Co-founder
  and CEO of Cognition, focusing heavily on Cognition''s rapid acquisition of the
  Windsurf team shortly after their separation from Google. The discussion spans the
  mechanics of the emergency deal, the rationale behind valuing the "husk" left behind,
  the competitive landscape in AI agents, and the future trajectory of AI in software
  development.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Applied AI/Software Development Agents**, specifically covering:

  *   The strategic acquisition of the Windsurf team by Cognition.

  *   The competitive dynamics between AI coding tools (Cognition/Devin, Cursor, Claude
  Code).

  *   The dependency structure within the AI ecosystem, particularly concerning foundation
  models like Anthropic''s Claude.

  *   The future productivity gains and skill shifts in software engineering due to
  advanced AI agents.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a Major Breakthrough:** Wu identifies RL as
  arguably the biggest breakthrough of the last 18 months, noting its power to solve
  benchmarks when provided with clean definitions of desired behaviors and success
  metrics.

  *   **Agent Ownership vs. Tool Use:** The future of programming involves agents
  moving beyond simply assisting (1.5x-2x efficiency today) to taking **full ownership**
  of tasks. The goal is to transition from reviewing code to directing the product
  vision (e.g., "add a new tab here," "change the database structure this way").

  *   **AI''s Inherent Value in Code:** Even if AI capabilities plateaued today, the
  impact on software development would still be transformative, making current engineering
  processes significantly slower by comparison.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **The Windsurf Acquisition Strategy:** Cognition executed a high-speed, high-conviction
  acquisition over a single weekend (Friday night to Monday morning) to secure the
  Windsurf GTM, marketing, and operations talent, which complemented Cognition''s
  core engineering focus.

  *   **Talent War Valuation:** Wu believes the intense competition and high valuations
  for top AI talent (estimated 100 to 1,000 truly critical individuals) are **reasonable**
  given that AI represents the greatest technological shift since the internet.

  *   **Value Accrual in AI:** Value will accrue wherever differentiation can be established—whether
  in chips, foundation models, or the application layer. Cognition focuses on optimizing
  for specific software capabilities and product experience.

  *   **Pricing Model:** Cognition prices its usage-based service (Devin) to be approximately
  **10x cheaper than the value of the engineer''s time** it saves, aiming to ensure
  the tool is sufficiently paid for the value created.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Scott Wu (Cognition CEO):** The central figure discussing the acquisition
  and his vision for AI agents.

  *   **Windsurf Team (Jeff, Graham, Kevin):** The acquired team, praised for their
  GTM/Ops expertise and their thoughtful handling of the separation from Google.

  *   **Google:** Implied to have overlooked the true value of the Windsurf asset/team
  left behind, leading to the opportunity for Cognition.

  *   **Anthropic:** Mentioned as a key foundation model provider, highlighting the
  industry''s current reliance on top-tier labs.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   No specific regulatory discussions were detailed, but the conversation touches
  on the **"unspoken covenant"** among founders, suggesting a shift in norms regarding
  company loyalty ("going down with the ship"), which has implications for corporate
  culture and talent retention during rapid industry change.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  *   **Productivity Leap:** Wu predicts that the current 1.5x to 2x efficiency gain
  for engineers using AI tools today could become **10X in three years**.

  *   **Jevons Paradox in Code:** Increased developer efficiency will lead to significantly
  **more code being written** (10X more), as software quality improves across the
  board (moving from low-reliability software like banking apps to high-reliability
  standards like TikTok).

  *   **Skill Shift:** The most valuable future skill will be **architectural decision-making**—defining
  the problem, solution, and architecture—as agents handle the execution details.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Venture Capitalists, AI Founders, Product
  Leaders, and Senior Software Engineering Executives** interested in the strategic
  business implications and near-term evolution of AI coding tools.'
