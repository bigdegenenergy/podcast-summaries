  text: A stablecoin is a better form of a dollar or a better transactional asset
    because with the dollar, you can either save it by putting it in a savings account,
    making it harder to transact, or you can spend it, putting it in a checking account,
    where you get zero interest. With a stablecoin, you get both; it's natively yield-bearing

summary: "# Podcast Summary: Why Every Company Will Have a Stablecoin — and Why One\
  \ L2 Isn't Enough - Ep. 912\n\n## Focus Area\nThis episode focuses on **blockchain\
  \ infrastructure and DeFi innovation**, specifically exploring the future of stablecoins\
  \ and Layer 2 scaling solutions. The discussion centers on how stablecoin issuance\
  \ will democratize and fragment, and why the current L2 landscape needs fundamental\
  \ restructuring.\n\n## Key Technical Insights\n• **Stablecoin Infrastructure Revolution**:\
  \ Bridge's Open Issuance platform enables any business to create custom stablecoins\
  \ with programmable features, breaking the USDC/USDT duopoly through seamless interoperability\
  \ networks that convert between different stablecoins one-for-one\n• **Payment Rail\
  \ Optimization**: Current blockchain limitations (wallet priming costs, TPS constraints,\
  \ gas complexity) necessitate purpose-built infrastructure like Tempo blockchain\
  \ for enterprise-scale payment processing\n• **Cross-Chain Abstraction**: Technical\
  \ solutions emerging to abstract away gas fees and bridge costs, enabling true dollar-for-dollar\
  \ transfers across different stablecoin ecosystems\n\n## Market/Investment Angle\n\
  • **Massive Market Expansion Opportunity**: The stablecoin market could grow to\
  \ \"many trillions of dollars\" as businesses realize they can capture treasury\
  \ yields (currently 3%+) instead of outsourcing to Circle/Tether\n• **L2 Commoditization\
  \ Thesis**: Manta Network argues that L2s are becoming commoditized infrastructure\
  \ fighting for \"crumbs,\" with real value creation shifting to application-layer\
  \ innovations that can onboard mainstream users\n• **Enterprise Adoption Acceleration**:\
  \ Post-Stripe acquisition, Bridge has shifted from serving small developers to major\
  \ fintechs, banks, and e-commerce platforms, indicating institutional validation\
  \ of stablecoin infrastructure\n\n## Notable Companies/People\n• **Bridge/Stripe**:\
  \ Zach Abrams (CEO) leading the largest crypto acquisition at the time, now launching\
  \ Open Issuance platform\n• **Manta Network**: Kenny Lee (co-founder) pivoting from\
  \ pure L2 play to application-focused strategy\n• **Key Partnerships**: BlackRock\
  \ (treasury management), Shopify (Pay with Crypto integration), various Latin American\
  \ fintech companies\n• **Ecosystem Players**: Circle, Tether (current stablecoin\
  \ dominators), Solana, Base (blockchain infrastructure)\n\n## Regulatory/Policy\
  \ Discussion\nThe conversation highlights how recent regulatory clarity has dramatically\
  \ accelerated stablecoin adoption. The Gensler Act's restriction on issuers passing\
  \ through interest to users actually creates competitive advantages for new entrants\
  \ who can offer yield-bearing stablecoins. This regulatory environment has shifted\
  \ institutional appetite from cautious exploration to active implementation.\n\n\
  ## Future Implications\nThe industry is heading toward a **multi-stablecoin ecosystem**\
  \ where every major platform operates its own dollar-pegged token, similar to how\
  \ payment processing has multiple players (Stripe, Adyen, WorldPay). This will enable:\n\
  - Instant settlement across card networks\n- Global financial products built on\
  \ unified stablecoin infrastructure  \n- Consumer deposits earning 3%+ yields automatically\n\
  - Immediate merchant payment settlement\n- True financial inclusion in regions with\
  \ unstable local currencies\n\nThe L2 space will likely consolidate around application\
  \ utility rather than pure infrastructure plays, with successful projects focusing\
  \ on user experience and mainstream adoption rather than technical specifications.\n\
  \n## Target Audience\nThis episode is most valuable for **crypto/DeFi professionals,\
  \ fintech executives, and institutional investors** evaluating stablecoin infrastructure\
  \ opportunities and L2 investment strategies. The technical depth and business model\
  \ analysis make it particularly relevant for those building or investing in blockchain-based\
  \ financial services.\n\n---\n\n## Comprehensive Analysis\n\nThis episode presents\
  \ a compelling vision of how stablecoin infrastructure will reshape global finance\
  \ while challenging conventional wisdom about Layer 2 scaling solutions. The conversation\
  \ reveals two critical inflection points in the crypto industry's maturation.\n\n\
  **The Stablecoin Transformation**\nZach Abrams articulates a fundamental shift from\
  \ the current USDC/USDT duopoly toward a fragmented ecosystem where every major\
  \ platform issues its own stablecoin. This isn't merely about competition—it's about\
  \ unlocking use cases that current issuers economically disincentivize. The technical\
  \ innovation lies in Bridge's interoperability network, which enables seamless conversion\
  \ between different stablecoins while maintaining the economic benefits for individual\
  \ issuers.\n\nThe business implications are profound. Companies can now capture\
  \ treasury yields that previously flowed to Circle and Tether, while programming\
  \ custom features like instant cross-border settlement or customer reward distribution.\
  \ This democratization of stablecoin issuance could accelerate adoption by removing\
  \ the structural limitations imposed by AUM-focused business models.\n\n**L2 Strategy\
  \ Rethinking**\nKenny Lee's perspective on Layer 2 solutions challenges the prevailing\
  \ \"build it and they will come\" mentality. His argument that L2s are becoming\
  \ commoditized infrastructure fighting for minimal market share reflects a broader\
  \ industry realization: technical superiority alone doesn't guarantee success. Manta's\
  \ pivot toward application development represents a strategic bet that user experience\
  \ and practical utility will ultimately determine winners in the scaling wars.\n\
  \n**Regulatory Catalyst**\nThe timing of these developments coincides with unprecedented\
  \ regulatory clarity, creating a perfect storm for institutional adoption. The irony\
  \ that restrictive regulations actually benefit new entrants by limiting incumbents'\
