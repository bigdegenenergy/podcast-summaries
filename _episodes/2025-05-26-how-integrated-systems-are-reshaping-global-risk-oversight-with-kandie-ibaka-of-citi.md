summary: '## Comprehensive Summary: How Integrated Systems Are Reshaping Global Risk
  Oversight - with Kandie Ibaka of Citi


  This podcast episode features Kandie Ibaka, VP and Sanctions Control Officer at
  Citi, discussing the critical challenge large financial institutions face in modernizing
  compliance and risk oversight while managing significant **legacy text stacks**
  and fragmented tools in the transition toward an AI-enabled future. The core narrative
  revolves around balancing automation, auditability, and the necessary preservation
  of manual, high-touch risk processes.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Global Risk Oversight and Compliance Modernization**
  within large financial institutions. Key themes include:

  *   **Legacy System Integration:** Dealing with outdated, siloed systems (the "paper
  era," "fax era") that hinder modern workflows.

  *   **AI/ML Application in Compliance:** Strategically layering intelligence (including
  Generative AI capabilities) on top of existing infrastructure for triage, documentation,
  and escalation.

  *   **Oversight vs. Automation:** Determining the practical trade-offs between accelerating
  processes and maintaining necessary human oversight for risk management.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Layering Intelligence over Legacy:** The immediate strategy for many institutions
  is not wholesale replacement, but embedding modern intelligence (AI/ML) on top of
  legacy tools to document, triage, and automate within existing, albeit outdated,
  workflows.

  *   **Connectedness and Modularity:** Future technology adoption criteria prioritize
  systems that "speak to each other," offering modularity, transparency, and the ability
  to evolve with changing business goals, moving away from monolithic, fixed-point
  solutions.

  *   **Tiered Risk Handling:** Utilizing technology (especially deterministic AI
  capabilities) for superior categorization and segmentation of risk, allowing for
  **proportional response**—routing high-risk activity for immediate, intelligent
  escalation while ensuring all risk receives appropriate, context-specific review.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **ROI and Long-Term Commitment:** Investments in complex compliance systems
  (like the custom-built SRM mentioned) require a long-term commitment; initial frustrations
  or slower-than-expected scaling do not automatically equate to a failure of ROI,
  necessitating leadership buy-in for continuous evaluation.

  *   **Orchestration as Competitive Edge:** Moving beyond reactive compliance to
  proactive risk management requires **orchestration**—systems working together seamlessly—to
  keep pace with the complexity of the business and regulatory changes.

  *   **Speed with Precision:** The goal is not just speed, but **precise time decision-making**.
  This means designing systems for "readiness," ensuring that the appropriate amount
  of human depth is applied based on the risk tier, rather than rushing every process.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Kandie Ibaka (Citi):** The primary expert, providing a practitioner''s view
  from a large global financial institution on the practical realities of compliance
  modernization, legacy system management, and AI integration.

  *   **Citi:** Used as the context for discussing the challenges faced by large,
  regulated entities dealing with extensive, established technology stacks.

  *   **Sears:** Mentioned as the sponsor of the special series on scaling AI.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward an **orchestrated compliance ecosystem** where technology
  facilitates agility. The focus is shifting from simply adopting the newest tool
  to ensuring **connectedness** across the entire tech stack. Future success hinges
  on designing systems that adapt continuously to evolving business models and risk
  appetites, rather than systems built for a fixed point in time.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Risk Management Professionals, Compliance
  Leaders, Financial Services Technology Strategists, and CIOs/CTOs** within highly
  regulated industries. It is essential for professionals navigating the practical
  challenges of integrating cutting-edge AI into established, complex, and often rigid
  enterprise technology environments.'
