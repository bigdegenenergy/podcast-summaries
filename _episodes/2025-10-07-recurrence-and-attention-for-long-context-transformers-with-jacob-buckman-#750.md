    dependency prevents the massive parallelization that GPUs excel at via large matrix
    multiplications.'

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The limitation, of course, is that all this computation must be done sequentially.
    GPUs love big matrix multiplications. There's nothing they like more, right? And
    when you're doing recurrent architecture, you have to unroll many, many sequential
    steps, so you can't express this as a big matrix multiplication.

    forms (recurrent vs. attention), which is the foundation for achieving hybrid
    efficiency.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced

    can be either expressed in a recurrent form... or it can be expressed in an equivalent
    attention form... And these two are mathematically equivalent.
  topic: technical

    breakthrough for combining the parallel efficiency of attention locally with the
    linear scaling of recurrence globally.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What's really cool is that you can combine them to get the best of both worlds.
    People call it the chunk algorithm. Basically, what you do is if you have a very
    long input sequence, you break it up into reasonably small chunks. Now, within
    each chunk, you use the attention calculation... But then you use recurrence between
    chunks.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: 'Provides a precise, causal explanation for quadratic scaling in
    Transformers: it stems directly from the linear growth of the KV cache (state
    size) interacting with per-token computation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The quadratic cost is downstream of the fact that the state size itself is
    growing linearly. So if you're doing a linear number of operations on each token,
    and the size of each operation is growing linearly, right, then that comes out
    to quadratic overall. So the reason why the quadratic scaling of a transformer
    sort of is a thing is because the state of a transformer is growing linearly.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: 'Provides a powerful comparative summary: Transformers suffer from
    state *bloat* (too large), while RNNs/SSMs suffer from state *poverty* (too small/fixed),
    framing the entire long-context debate around state size.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: RNNs, including all state space models, have the opposite problem of transformers.
    Transformers have a state—at long context, at least—transformers have a state
    that's way too large. And so all these levers exist to make that state small.
    Now, RNNs do not have this problem. RNN states are way too small.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: Provides a stark, quantitative comparison illustrating why modern
    Transformers outperform LSTMs/RNNs, attributing the gap primarily to state size
    differences rather than just parameter count.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: RNN states are way too small. And you can kind of just napkin map this out,
    and it becomes actually crazy that people ever trained an LSTM because for an
    LSTM, the state size at each layer is, let's say, it's equivalent to the feature
    size, so it's like let's say 64.

    increasing the smaller component (state or weights) yields performance gains without
    significant cost until balance is approached.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If one of these things is much larger than the other, double the smaller thing,
    free. And then you apply that same argument again. You can still double it and
    double it and double it and double it, and eventually you'll get into a regime
    where you notice the doubling in terms of wall-clock time. But that won't happen
    until weights and states are doing roughly the same number of FLOPs...
  topic: technical/strategy
- impact_reason: 'A major strategic implication: achieving very long context in Transformers
    requires parameter counts orders of magnitude larger than current state-of-the-art,

  relevance_score: 10

  text: if you have a transformer with very long context, attention is so, so expensive,
    you're doing all those state FLOPs, that it is basically free to double the weights.
    You might as well do it, right? And so this means that like the only architectures

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Recurrence and Attention for Long-Context Transformers
  with Jacob Buckman - #750


  This episode of the Two Minute AI podcast, hosted by Sam Charrington, features Jacob
  Buckman, co-founder and CEO of Manifest AI, discussing the critical challenge of
  achieving effective **long context** in Transformer models and introducing their
  proposed solution, the **Power Retention architecture**.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on overcoming the computational bottlenecks of standard Transformer
  attention mechanisms when dealing with extremely long input sequences (context length).
  The discussion centers on architectural innovations that aim to achieve **compute-optimal
  scaling** by balancing the axes of scale, specifically focusing on the context axis
  through a mechanism called **Retention**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Context as an Axis of Scale:** Effective long context is framed as another
  crucial axis of scaling, analogous to parameters or dataset size. Improvements in
  context utilization lead to measurable, log-linear improvements in pre-training
  negative log-likelihood, suggesting that better context handling directly translates
  to better predictive ability.

  *   **The Power of Retention (Recurrence + Attention):** Retention is presented
  as a family of architectures (related to Mamba 2 and DeltaNet) that mathematically
  unifies recurrent and attention-based computation. It allows for computation to
  be expressed either sequentially (recurrent form, linear cost, fixed state size)
  or in parallel (attention form, quadratic cost, GPU-friendly).

  *   **Chunking for Optimal Performance:** The key innovation is the **chunked algorithm**
  for Retention. By breaking long sequences into small chunks, attention is used within
  the chunk for hardware efficiency (parallelization), and recurrence is used *between*
  chunks. This yields the parallelization benefits of attention while maintaining
  an overall **linear cost** relative to context length, determined by the fixed size
  of the GPU memory.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Context Utility vs. Context Length:** There is a growing realization that
  simply having a large context window (e.g., millions of tokens) does not guarantee
  utility. Value is derived from the model''s ability to *effectively use* that context,
  which requires architectural improvements.

  *   **The Bottleneck of Context Scaling:** The high cost associated with scaling
  context length is identified as a major current bottleneck preventing models from
  reaching their full potential across various domains (text, video, etc.). Companies
  solving this problem, like Manifest AI, are targeting a fundamental architectural
  limitation.

  *   **Unifying Architectural Design:** The discussion provides a framework for understanding
  various long-context solutions (like Mamba, windowed attention, GQA) by analyzing
  how they reduce the size or growth rate of the model''s "state" (analogous to the
  KV cache in Transformers). This offers strategic insight into architectural trade-offs.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jacob Buckman (Manifest AI):** Co-founder and CEO, presenting the research
  on the Power Retention architecture.

  *   **Sam Charrington (Host):** Host of the Two Minute AI podcast.

  *   **Mila / Google Brain:** Institutions where Jacob Buckman conducted prior research
  in deep learning and RL.

  *   **Mamba:** Mentioned as a prominent example of a state-space model that falls
  under the broader "retention" umbrella.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward architectures that achieve **compute optimality**
  by balancing all axes of scale, not just parameters. The future of long-context
  models likely involves hybrid architectures like chunked Retention, which leverage
  hardware capabilities (parallel matrix multiplication) while maintaining linear
  scaling costs, potentially making extremely long-context processing economically
  viable.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI/ML Researchers, Deep Learning Engineers,
  and Technical Product Managers** involved in building or optimizing large language
