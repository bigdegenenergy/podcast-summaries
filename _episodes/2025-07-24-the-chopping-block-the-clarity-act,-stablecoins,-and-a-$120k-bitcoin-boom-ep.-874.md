  text: This was able to make it onto the floor of the house and ultimately passed
    a very big bipartisan vote, 308 to 122. So, more than two-thirds margin that this
    vote ended up passing. It was then signed by the president on July 18th. So, we
    now have a stablecoin bill. I believe this is basically the first piece of law
    about crypto in American history.
  topic: Regulation
- impact_reason: 'Provides a strong thesis for white-label stablecoins: saturation
    in the general crypto market forces issuers to target specific, non-crypto native
    customer bases (e-commerce, fintech) via bespoke solutions.'

    addressing a common point of market confusion.

    creating a reliable, global, digital export of the USD, transcending mere domestic
    payment efficiency.'

    250 billion. That's like 70% year-over-year growth. That's an insane growth rate
    that he's projecting for stablecoins.

    offer yield directly to users via partner banks, potentially disintermediating
    traditional money market funds.

  text: But, I even think about these sort of yield-sharing agreements as, you know,
    sort of being a backdoor into, hey, maybe you don't actually need to buy a money
    market fund. Like, you keep it in, you know, whatever Brazilian neo-bank, and
    we'll kind of pass you through some yield from Circle.
  topic: defi

summary: '## Podcast Summary: The Chopping Block: The Clarity Act, Stablecoins, and
  a $120K Bitcoin Boom - Ep. 874


  This episode of The Chopping Block focuses heavily on the landmark passage of the
  **Clarity Act (referred to as the "GUS Act" or stablecoin bill)** in the US, its
  immediate implications, and broader market movements, including a rally that pushed
  Bitcoin toward $120k.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Cryptocurrency Regulation and Stablecoins**, specifically
  analyzing the newly enacted US stablecoin legislation. Secondary topics include
  market sentiment following the legislative success and speculation on the future
  structure of stablecoin issuance.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **New Regulatory Charter:** The GUS Act establishes an entirely new regulatory
  regime for stablecoin issuers, creating a specific charter at the **Office of the
  Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)**. Issuers with over $10 billion in market cap
  will likely need this federal charter, though smaller issuers might register at
  the state level if state regimes align with federal standards.

  *   **No Yield-Bearing Stablecoins:** A key provision of the bill explicitly **prohibits
  yield-bearing stablecoins**. However, the panelists anticipate that revenue-sharing
  agreements (rev shares) between issuers and distribution partners will effectively
  pass yield back to end-users.

  *   **Distinction from Tokenized Deposits:** The discussion clarified that regulated
  bank consortium efforts (like those involving J.P. Morgan) focusing on **tokenized
  bank deposits** are fundamentally different from stablecoins, as tokenized deposits
  lack the specific, one-to-one reserve backing requirements mandated for stablecoins
  under the new law.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Market Reaction:** The passage of the stablecoin bill, alongside positive
  political momentum during "Crypto Week," was cited as a major catalyst for the recent
  market rally, including Bitcoin hitting $120k.

  *   **Issuance Model Shift:** Panelists predict a significant shift toward **Stablecoin-as-a-Service
  (white-labeling)** models. Large tech companies (Meta, Amazon) or major consumer
  brands are unlikely to seek direct OCC charters due to cost and regulatory hurdles;
  instead, they will partner with existing licensed issuers for white-label services
  and revenue sharing.

  *   **Future Growth Projections:** While some panelists projected stablecoin issuance
  reaching $1.5–$2 trillion by 2030, others noted projections as high as $3.7 trillion
  (a 70% YoY growth rate), suggesting stablecoins could capture a significant portion
  of M2 money supply.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Rebecca Redig (G.O. Labs):** Provided expert legal analysis on the structure
  and implications of the GUS Act.

  *   **Tether (Paolo Ardoino):** Noted for his prominent presence at the bill signing
  ceremony, suggesting institutional acceptance or recognition.

  *   **Circle/Coinbase:** Mentioned in the context of existing yield-sharing arrangements
  that may persist despite the ban on native yield.

  *   **Gora (formerly known for BUSD):** Highlighted as a key player in the white-label
  stablecoin service space, potentially benefiting from the new structure.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **First Major Crypto Law:** The GUS Act is recognized as the first significant
  piece of federal cryptocurrency legislation in US history, providing much-needed
  "clear, straightforward lines" for the industry.

  *   **Anti-Big Tech Provision:** The bill specifically restricts stablecoin issuance
  to entities primarily involved in financial services, effectively blocking large
  non-financial tech companies (like Meta/Facebook''s previous Libra ambitions) from
  obtaining the charter directly.

  *   **AML/KYC:** Stablecoin issuers must comply with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)
  and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) requirements, specifically at the on-ramps and off-ramps
  to fiat.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward **standardization and institutional integration**
  of USD-backed digital assets. While the bill formalizes the existing structure for
  major players like Circle and Tether, the real innovation will occur in the **distribution
  layer** via white-label services catering to traditional businesses looking to reduce
  payment fees and improve settlement times. The conversation suggests that stablecoins
  will become the backend for global digital dollar settlement, rather than directly
  replacing credit cards (due to the lack of chargeback/clawback features).


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto/Web3 Professionals, Fintech Investors,
  Legal/Compliance Officers, and Institutional Strategists** who need to understand
  the immediate operational and strategic shifts resulting from major US stablecoin
  regulation.'
