summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Inside KKR''s Monster $8BN European Fund with Philip
  Freise


  This episode of 20VC features Harry Stebbings in conversation with **Philip Freise,
  Co-Head of European Private Equity at KKR**, discussing the firm''s massive $8 billion
  European fund, lessons learned from past investment mistakes, and the evolving landscape
  of private equity (PE) versus venture capital (VC).


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Private Equity and Growth Investing**, specifically
  focusing on large-scale European buyouts, portfolio construction, managing market
  cycles (especially liquidity droughts), and the strategic differences between PE
  and early-stage venture capital. Secondary themes include the impact of technological
  disruption (AI) and geopolitical risks on investment theses.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **PE Portfolio Construction Discipline:** KKR manages its $8 billion fund with
  a disciplined structure, targeting around 15 investments. Freise emphasizes the
  necessity of forcing sales on "good" but not "great" performers (those compounding
  below 20%) to concentrate capital on true winners, contrasting this with the VC
  model that often relies on a few massive outliers.

  *   **Deployment Pacing:** Despite market volatility (like COVID-19), KKR maintained
  a disciplined, linear deployment schedule (targeting 20-25% per year over a 4-5
  year cycle), learning from the GFC when they were too hesitant. They deployed aggressively
  during COVID, believing in controlling what they could.

  *   **Partnership vs. Outright Buyout:** Over the last 10-15 years, three-quarters
  of KKR''s European investments have been structured as **partnerships** (minority
  or significant stakes, e.g., 30-35%), rather than outright majority buyouts, reflecting
  a more collaborative approach with founders.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Turkey Investment Failure:** Freise detailed a painful $500 million loss in
  Turkey on a logistics player (UNRORO), stemming from underestimating the flexibility
  of the **rule of law** in emerging markets. This led KKR to adopt a blunt view:
  avoid political and currency risk when Western Europe offers ample opportunity.

  *   **COVID-19 Investment Thesis:** KKR deployed 40% of the fund during the pandemic,
  making bold calls like investing in **Vella** (a hair color brand) and Koti, based
  on conviction in underlying consumer behavior (e.g., demographics) that AI or lockdowns
  wouldn''t fundamentally change.

  *   **Liquidity Cycle View:** Freise dismisses the current liquidity drought as
  **structural**, viewing it as a cyclical hangover from the "artificial" exuberance
  of 2021/2022. He expects a return to "normal" liquidity, contrasting with predictions
  of permanent scarcity.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Philip Freise (KKR):** Co-Head of European Private Equity, managing the $8B
  fund.

  *   **KKR''s European Fund:** Currently the largest private equity fund in Europe
  ($8 billion).

  *   **Past Failures:** UNRORO (Turkey logistics) and an investment in Africa (tulips/roses
  in Ethiopia).

  *   **Successful Investments Mentioned:** FGS Global, Superstruct, Assur-Springer,
  BMG Rights Management, GetYourGuide, and Vella/Koti during COVID.

  *   **Web 1.0 Experience:** Freise referenced his early involvement with **Venture
  Park** in 1999/2000, highlighting the critical lesson of choosing long-term oriented
  investors over those seeking quick flips.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  Freise expressed a **free-market view**, stating that tariffs are not the answer
  to underlying economic issues in Western democracies. The discussion on Turkey implicitly
  highlighted the risk of weak regulatory and legal frameworks in certain emerging
  markets.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  *   **AI vs. Traditional PE:** Freise believes that while AI companies (like those
  in legal tech) may scale revenue faster than ever seen before, the fundamental principles
  of **capital allocation** remain crucial. He predicts that the hyper-scaling seen
  in early AI winners will not become the norm for all SaaS/software investments,
  maintaining a role for traditional, capital-intensive businesses (like his fertility
  clinic portfolio).

  *   **PE vs. VC Skill Sets:** He strongly asserts that the DNA and skill set required
  for late-stage PE (operational involvement, deep industry knowledge) are fundamentally
  different from those needed for early-stage VC (pattern recognition, speed). He
  admires VC leaders but sees KKR remaining focused on its later-stage operational
  expertise.

  *   **Public Markets Decline:** Freise noted that some family foundations are choosing
  PE partners over public markets due to the perceived lack of support and volatility
  in public listings (citing OHB and GFK as examples).


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Private Equity professionals, Growth Equity
  investors, institutional Limited Partners (LPs), and corporate strategists** interested
  in large-scale European deal-making, portfolio management discipline, and navigating
  market cycles.'
