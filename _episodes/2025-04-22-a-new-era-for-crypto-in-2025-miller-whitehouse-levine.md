    noting how unclear definitions have been actively used against the industry, necessitating
    clear legislative lines.

  text: We've been suffering under the ambiguity or interpretability, if that's even
    a word, of those definitions for the last four years. We can't go back to that.
    We need legal certainty on that question because I think crypto better than any
    other industry unfortunately understands how legal ambiguities or interpretations
    can be weaponized against an industry.

    fear regarding stablecoins, suggesting the threat is to a 'flawed business model'

    dawn at the SEC. Folks were fighting unsuccessfully to date to get documents for
    years around the SEC's decision-making in the Ripple case. And to your point,
    now the crypto task force is proactively posting everything well before any FOIA
    request for any of it happens.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: A New Era For Crypto In 2025 | Miller Whitehouse-Levine


  This 59-minute episode features an in-depth conversation with **Miller Whitehouse-Levine**,
  the newly appointed CEO of the **Solana Policy Institute (SPI)**, focusing on the
  strategic shift toward ecosystem-specific policy advocacy and the critical legislative
  landscape in Washington D.C.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **evolution of crypto policy advocacy in Washington D.C.**,
  specifically the rationale behind forming an ecosystem-specific lobbying group (the
  SPI) rather than relying solely on general industry organizations. Key themes include
  the current state of major crypto legislation (stablecoins and market structure),
  the shift in political climate post-Gensler era, and the strategic importance of
  educating policymakers about the breadth of the Solana ecosystem beyond recent speculative
  trends.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Policy Flow Reversal:** The SPI aims to reverse the trend where builders design
  products *around* regulatory constraints. The goal is to enable builders to innovate
  freely first, then address regulatory/legal implications within a workable framework.

  *   **Legislative Focus on Core Infrastructure:** Current legislative efforts are
  targeting foundational elements: ensuring liquidity and reserve transparency for
  custodial stablecoins, and establishing clear jurisdiction between the SEC and CFTC
  for token classification.

  *   **Ecosystem Differentiation:** The discussion implicitly highlights Solana''s
  technical advantages (speed, low cost) as the underlying reason for its development
  explosion, making its story easier to tell in D.C. compared to narratives focused
  solely on DeFi or speculative assets.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Legislative Certainty as an Unlock:** Enactment of stablecoin legislation
  (like the **Stable Act** or **Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act**) is viewed as
  a "massive unlock" for the ecosystem, driving increased use and adoption of dollar
  stablecoins.

  *   **Risk of Regulatory Capture:** There is a significant concern that overly complex
  or expensive regulatory frameworks could lead to regulatory capture, making legal
  compliance accessible only to highly capitalized entities (e.g., large banks), thereby
  stifling innovation for smaller protocols.

  *   **Investment in Policy Pays Off:** The success of recent bipartisan legislative
  efforts (like overturning the SEC''s intermediation rule via the CRA resolution)
  is cited as concrete evidence that sustained investment in policy expertise yields
  tangible industry benefits.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Miller Whitehouse-Levine:** CEO of the newly formed Solana Policy Institute
  (SPI); previously CEO of the DeFi Education Fund and an early employee at the Blockchain
  Association.

  *   **Kristen Smith:** CEO of the Blockchain Association, who is joining Miller
  as President of the SPI. She is highlighted as a policy icon and compelling spokesperson.

  *   **Solana Foundation:** Confirmed to be involved in discussions leading up to
  the SPI''s formation, with one board member coming from the Foundation, though funding
  sources remain partially undisclosed.

  *   **Key Congressional Figures:** Mentioned as driving current legislation: **Senator
  Tim Scott** (Senate Banking Committee Chair) and **Chair French Hill** (House Financial
  Services Committee).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Stablecoin Regulation:** Bills are progressing in both the House and Senate,
  focusing on reserve composition, liquidity requirements, and issuer transparency
  to mitigate run risks.

  *   **Market Structure Legislation:** This aims to resolve the SEC/CFTC jurisdictional
  ambiguity. It seeks to define when tokens are securities versus commodities (like
  Bitcoin), and crucially, establish oversight for centralized exchanges following
  the FTX collapse.

  *   **The End of the "Existential Threat":** The departure of the unified threat
  posed by the "Gary Gensler era" has led to policy prioritization divergence among
  different crypto ecosystems, moving from a "live or die" scenario to differentiated
  strategic goals.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is entering a **"critical two-year period"** for U.S. crypto policy.
  The future hinges on successfully translating the current legislative momentum into
  durable law. Whitehouse-Levine stresses the need to prevent a future "whiplash"
  by codifying favorable rules now. Furthermore, the rise of ecosystem-specific advocacy
  suggests a fragmentation of the unified crypto lobbying front, requiring these groups
  to advocate for **"tech-neutral policies"** to ensure a level playing field and
  avoid regulatory capture that benefits one chain at the expense of others.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto/Web3 Executives, Policy Strategists,
  Legal Counsel, and Investors** focused on regulatory risk, legislative strategy,
  and the long-term viability of specific blockchain ecosystems in the U.S. market.'
