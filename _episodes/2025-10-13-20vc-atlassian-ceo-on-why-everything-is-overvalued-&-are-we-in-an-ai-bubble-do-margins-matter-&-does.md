  text: If you think, okay, there's going to be a new model about every three months
    and there's going to be four to six companies competing, what we need to be able
    to do is pick up a new model, test it, work out whether it's better in a certain
    case, deploy it, and get it out to customers. That is an expertise that we need
    to build, and we have built.
  topic: AI technology trends
- impact_reason: 'Directly addresses the value proposition shift: if creation is cheap,
    scarcity shifts to quality execution (design), making good design a premium asset.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Does the democratization or the cheapening of software creation make software
    more or less valuable? Does it make design more or less valuable? I do think it
    makes design more valuable. Good design scares resources, probably gets more valuable,
    and I think good design is quite scarce.

  text: Would you pay 10X the price of those tools? No, probably not. Why not? I've

    the competitive vector between them is not going to let you do that, firstly,
    in terms of the switching cost.

    speed of creation inherently prevents the slow, organic embedding required for
    high switching costs.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think like a lot of things in AI, most of these businesses have been built
    very fast... which almost by virtue of that means the switching costs are quite
    low at the moment. You cannot build a business fast that has high switching costs.

  text: The old classical, if you're just an OpenAI wrapper as a startup, I do think
    you're in trouble. But we might look back and think that was a good way to start
    some of these businesses, but they end up being very different.
  topic: business

    changes (likely AI automation reducing the need for human seats) and challenges
    the dominant SaaS pricing paradigm.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The question that remains is like the pricing model. We've got so used to
    a per-seat pricing. It's what predicates Salesforce's growth now. It's just an
    expansion in seats, bluntly. Does the per-seat pricing model die in the next wave
    of SaaS?

    and self-disruption are necessary; defense alone is insufficient against technological

  text: What sets them apart? I think those type of companies is they are always creating.
    It's very hard in technology to survive multiple decades with just like a really
    good thing that you can sort of protect and defend. You have to create, which
    means you have to destroy, you have to move on, you have to change and adapt.

summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Atlassian CEO on Valuation, AI, and the Future
  of Work


  This episode features an in-depth conversation between Harry Stebbings (20VC) and
  Mike Cannon-Brookes, Co-founder and CEO of Atlassian, covering market overvaluation,
  the impact of AI, leadership dynamics, and the future of software development.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centered on **market sentiment and valuation** (particularly concerning
  the current tech landscape and AI), **Atlassian’s strategic response to the AI era**,
  the evolution of **leadership structures** (co-CEO vs. solo CEO), and the **future
  of developer tooling and pricing models**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Multi-Model Strategy:** Atlassian deliberately built its technology to be
  **multi-model agnostic**, anticipating multiple foundational models competing, rather
  than attempting to train its own. Their core expertise is rapidly adopting, testing,
  and deploying the value of new models to customers.

  *   **Design as a Differentiator in AI:** In the current technological transition
  (AI), the importance of fundamental **design** (how software works, not just aesthetics)
  is being re-underwritten, similar to how "pull-to-refresh" became a standard interaction
  paradigm.

  *   **Efficiency Gains:** Cannon-Brookes predicts that 10 years from now, companies
  will have significantly **more engineers** working for them, but these engineers
  will be **far more efficient** due to tooling advancements (like AI integration).


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Overvaluation Concerns:** Cannon-Brookes asserts that **most things in the
  current market are vastly overvalued**, making investment decisions extremely difficult.
  He notes the classic pattern where many overvalued assets fail, but a few (like
  Amazon post-dot-com) become massive.

  *   **Uncertain AI Business Models:** The current AI revenue narrative is questioned,
  as many companies show high revenue figures based on spending loops (e.g., paying
  Nvidia, cloud providers) without clear, durable profitability models yet established.

  *   **Customer Stability in Chaos:** In times of market uncertainty and rapid technological
  change, the most stable anchor for business strategy is **deeply listening to customers**
  to build conviction on what truly matters versus market noise.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Mike Cannon-Brookes (Atlassian CEO):** Central figure, known for his "unreasonable
  man" philosophy, successful bootstrapping, and recent shift to solo CEO.

  *   **Scott Farquhar (Atlassian Co-founder):** Highlighted as a critical partner
  in the co-CEO structure, known for his extreme work ethic ("David Goggins" analogy).

  *   **Spotify Co-CEOs (Alex Nordstrom and Gustav Sotasstrom):** Mentioned as a contemporary
  example of a new co-CEO structure, prompting advice from Cannon-Brookes.

  *   **David Goggins:** Referenced as an embodiment of pushing through suffering
  and avoiding mediocrity.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is entering a **"Cambrian explosion"** period driven by AI, characterized
  by high turmoil, rapid change, and unpredictable outcomes over the next 3-5 years.
  Companies must be willing to make **bold bets** (investments/strategic choices)
  but also maintain the **flexibility to reassess and pivot** those fundamental beliefs
  quarterly. The future of work involves significantly higher developer productivity,
  potentially leading to increased headcount focused on creation rather than maintenance.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Venture Capitalists, Technology Executives,
  Product Leaders, and Founders** interested in software company scaling, leadership
  transitions, and strategic navigation through foundational technological shifts
  like AI.'
