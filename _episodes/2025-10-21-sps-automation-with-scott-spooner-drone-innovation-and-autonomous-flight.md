summary: '## New Zealand Tech Podcast Summary: Bespoke Robotics and Autonomous Systems
  with Scott Spooner (SPS Automation)


  This episode of the New Zealand Tech Podcast, hosted by Paul Spain, features an
  in-depth conversation with Scott Spooner, founder of **SPS Automation**, focusing
  on the development of bespoke, advanced drone and robotics technology, particularly
  for challenging environments in New Zealand.


  ---


  ### 1. Main Narrative Arc and Key Discussion Points


  The discussion traces the evolution of SPS Automation, starting from its roots (which
  include the merger with Eronavax, where Spooner was previously Chief Engineer) to
  its current status as a specialist in novel aviation products. The central narrative
  revolves around solving complex, real-world problemsâ€”most notably invasive species
  controlâ€”using highly customized, modular autonomous systems. A significant portion
  is dedicated to the technical challenges of building large, hybrid-powered drones
  capable of complex operations like precision spraying and operating in swarms, all
  while navigating a flexible but complex regulatory landscape.


  ### 2. Major Topics, Themes, and Subject Areas Covered


  *   **Bespoke Robotics and Drones:** Development of custom Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
  (UAVs) ranging from small, swarm-capable units to large, heavy-lift multirotors.

  *   **Invasive Species Control:** Application of drone technology for targeted herbicide
  application against wilding pines, a major environmental issue in New Zealand.

  *   **Advanced Avionics and Modularity:** Internal development of flight control
  systems, redundancy measures, and a modular design philosophy to reuse components
  across different platforms.

  *   **Drone Light Shows and Swarm Technology:** Development and deployment of technology
  enabling large-scale, coordinated drone displays.

  *   **Power Systems:** Utilization of hybrid propulsion (internal combustion engine
  driving an alternator for electric motors) for extended endurance on large aircraft.

  *   **Regulatory Navigation:** Working closely with the Civil Aviation Authority
  (CA) under Part 102 rules to gain approval for complex, beyond visual line of sight
  (BVLOS), tele-operated operations.


  ### 3. Technical Concepts, Methodologies, or Frameworks Discussed


  *   **Dissimilar Redundancy:** Implementing multiple, fundamentally different sensor
  systems (e.g., GPS and ground-beacon triangulation) for primary flight sensors to
  ensure safety if one technology fails.

  *   **RTK GPS:** Real-Time Kinematic GPS used for high-precision positioning, often
  dual-redundant in critical applications like drone shows.

  *   **Hybrid Propulsion:** Using an onboard generator (IC engine) to power electric
  propulsion, maximizing flight time over pure battery power.

  *   **Tele-operation:** Operating aircraft remotely from a central control center,
  allowing expert pilots to manage multiple drones simultaneously.

  *   **Machine Vision/AI:** Forward and downward-facing stereo cameras used for obstacle
  avoidance, plant recognition, and calculating targeted chemical dosages.

  *   **SORA 2.5:** Specific Operational Risk Assessment methodology adapted by the
  company to prove safety cases for novel, non-prescriptive operations to the CA.


  ### 4. Business Implications and Strategic Insights


  SPS Automation operates on a dual business model: **Contract R&D** (acting as an
  R&D enabler for universities and other companies) and **Internal Development** (funded
  by private shareholders). This strategy allows them to offset the high cost of developing
  their proprietary aircraft (like the BFD series) while maintaining control over
  quality through in-house design and modular engineering. Their success in wilding
  pine spraying demonstrates a clear path to commercial viability in specialized agricultural
  and environmental services where traditional methods are inefficient or inaccessible.


  ### 5. Key Personalities and Thought Leaders Mentioned


  *   **Scott Spooner:** Founder of SPS Automation and former Chief Engineer at Eronavax.

  *   **Paul Spain:** Host of the New Zealand Tech Podcast.

  *   **Isaac (from Drone Shows):** Mentioned in context of swarm technology development,
  indicating collaboration or shared industry knowledge.


  ### 6. Predictions, Trends, or Future-Looking Statements


  Spooner is focused on developing autonomous vehicles for jobs where human presence
  is undesirable or dangerous, specifically avoiding the immediate pursuit of personal
  air vehicles/air taxis. Future plans include:

  *   Developing the **BFD Pro** (a larger variant).

  *   Exploring **250 kg+ payload** aircraft.

  *   Moving toward **herbicide-free invasive plant control** solutions.

  *   Creating a comprehensive **ecosystem of autonomous vehicle technology** for
  the betterment of New Zealand.


  ### 7. Practical Applications and Real-World Examples


  The most compelling example was the **wilding pine spraying trial in Central Otago**.
  Using the smaller **AC 16 drone**, the team cleared 350-450 trees across 500 hectares
  in just 2.5 days, achieving a **100% kill rate** even in windy conditions and inaccessible
  cliff faces. This validated the precision and effectiveness of their chemical application
  systems, countering industry skepticism about drone spraying efficacy.


  ### 8. Controversies, Challenges, or Problems Highlighted


  *   **Technical Difficulty:** Developing complex systems like dissimilar redundancy
  and advanced C2 links in-house is inherently stressful and technically demanding.

  *   **Regulatory Ambiguity:** While the New Zealand CA is flexible, the lack of
  prescriptive rules under Part 102 requires companies like SPS to invest heavily
  in developing and proving complex risk assessments (like adapting SORA 2.5) from
  scratch.

  *   **Industry Misinformation:** There is existing doubt within the industry regarding
  the reliability and effectiveness of drone spraying operations.


  ### 9. Solutions, Recommendations, or Actionable Advice Provided


  *   **Embrace Modularity:** Design systems so that components developed for one
  platform can be rolled'
