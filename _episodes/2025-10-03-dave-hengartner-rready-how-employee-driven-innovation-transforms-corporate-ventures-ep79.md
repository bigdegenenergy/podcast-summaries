summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - Ready AI originated from an internal innovation program at Swisscom, which spun
    out into an independent venture four and a half years ago.
  - The platform addresses the massive 'innovation gap' where 83% of companies prioritize
    innovation, but only 3% deliver on their goals.
  - Employee entrepreneurship involves providing internal innovators with the tools,
    space, and support to execute their ideas, similar to how Steve Jobs treated the
    Macintosh team.
  - Ready AI functions as a SaaS provider for various innovation programs (idea management,
    portfolio management, trend management) built on a flexible, API-first architecture.
  - AI is integrated to solve specific innovation problems, particularly by supercharging
    ideation workflows, validating ideas against market signals, and tapping into
    internal data sources (ERPs, CRMs).
  - Successful AI adoption hinges on seamless integration into existing workflows
    (one-click execution) and clear communication that AI is an assistant for productivity,
    not just a cost-cutting threat.
  - Data governance, privacy (ISO certifications), and the ability to integrate customer-specific
    LLMs are crucial for enterprise adoption.
  overview: Dave Hengartner, CEO of Ready AI, discusses how his company provides the
    tools, resources, and support necessary for employee-driven innovation within
    large corporations, essentially acting as an internal venture builder. Ready AI
    has evolved from an internal innovation methodology at Swisscom into a comprehensive
    SaaS platform that leverages AI to solve the persistent innovation gap plaguing
    large enterprises. The core focus is on systematically increasing the volume and
    relevance of ideas by supercharging ideation through structured workflows and
    external/internal data signals.
  themes:
  - Employee-Driven Innovation and Entrepreneurship
  - The Innovation Gap and Corporate Challenges
  - AI as a Tool for Innovation Throughput
