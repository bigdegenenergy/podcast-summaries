summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Inside Carnegie Mellon''s $4BN Endowment & The
  Realities of Venture Capital


  This 87-minute episode features Harry Stebbings in conversation with **Miles Dieffenbach,
  Managing Director of Investments at Carnegie Mellon University''s (CMU) Endowment**,
  offering a rare look into the endowment''s investment philosophy, portfolio construction,
  and candid views on the venture capital asset class. The discussion also touches
  on Dieffenbach''s personal journey, including surviving cancer, which profoundly
  shaped his perspective on risk and perseverance.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Endowment Management and Venture Capital Allocation**. Key
  themes include:

  *   CMU''s specific portfolio construction ($4B AUM).

  *   The risk/reward trade-off in private markets, particularly Venture Capital (VC).

  *   Critique of current VC fund structures, sizing, and performance metrics (DPI,
  TVPI).

  *   The competitive dynamics between multi-stage funds and emerging seed-stage managers.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **CMU Portfolio Structure:** The endowment targets an **85% Equity / 15% Fixed
  Income** split. Within the equity allocation, **50% is dedicated to private markets**
  (VC, PE, Real Estate, Private Credit), making CMU significantly **overweight venture
  (under 25% of total AUM)** compared to peers.

  *   **Performance Benchmarking (PME):** CMU rigorously uses Public Market Equivalents
  (PME) for every private asset class (e.g., QQQ for Venture, mid-cap value for Buyout).
  Dieffenbach asserts that **the median IRR for VC since 1998 is only about 8% net**,
  suggesting LPs are generally **not being compensated for the risk** taken, especially
  below the top decile of managers.

  *   **The Five Pillars of Venture:** Sourcing, Picking, Winning, Helping, and **Selling**.
  Dieffenbach emphasizes that "Selling" (distribution strategy) is becoming increasingly
  critical, noting that managers who distribute cash immediately upon exit are preferred
  over those distributing stock due to potential pricing discrepancies.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **90% of LPs Shouldn''t Invest in VC:** Dieffenbach argues that unless a new
  allocator can secure **top decile access**, they are better served by public market
  technology exposure, as the median VC performance lags public equivalents.

  *   **Critique of Seed Funds ($50M–$100M):** These funds are deemed structurally
  flawed for modern seed rounds (average $4M–$5M). To achieve proper diversification
  (30 companies), a $100M fund cannot write the necessary $1.5M+ checks required to
  compete for consensus deals, forcing them into subscale ownership or non-competitive
  rounds.

  *   **Multi-Stage Dominance:** Large, multi-stage funds are effectively "flagging
  the seed" stage with larger checks and a lower cost of capital, crowding out smaller
  seed specialists, unless those specialists focus on truly non-consensus ideas.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Miles Dieffenbach (CMU):** The guest, providing institutional LP perspective.

  *   **Carnegie Mellon Endowment:** Manages $4B AUM, known for its aggressive private
  market allocation.

  *   **Sequoia/Accel/Index:** Mentioned as examples of premier, established brands
  whose partner networks drive proprietary sourcing.

  *   **Square (Block):** Cited as an example of a company whose management team was
  permanently excellent at the "Selling" pillar.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No specific regulatory discussions were highlighted, but the conversation heavily
  implied the need for **greater transparency and realism in manager reporting**,
  particularly concerning the aggressive valuation marks seen in 2021/2022 vintages.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward **greater bifurcation**:

  1.  **Elite Access:** Top-tier managers will continue to command access and premium
  returns (70% access, 30% picking).

  2.  **The Squeeze on Mid-Tier/New Funds:** Smaller, less established funds will
  struggle significantly due to competition from scaled multi-stage players and the
  difficulty of achieving diversification in today''s high-priced seed environment.
  LPs must be highly selective or stick to public markets.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Institutional Investors (LPs), Venture Capital GPs, and Investment Consultants.**
  Professionals managing or allocating significant capital to private markets will
  find the data-driven critique of VC performance and fund sizing most valuable.'
