summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Building the Transparency Economy with Benjamin
  Diggles from Constellation Network


  This 61-minute episode of the "Edge of Show" features an in-depth discussion with
  **Benjamin Diggles, Co-founder of Constellation Network**, focusing on the critical
  role of verifiable digital evidence in restoring trust across industries, particularly
  in the age of AI proliferation. The conversation charts Constellation’s journey
  from early government contracts to launching commercial products aimed at creating
  a "trillion-dollar transparency economy."


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**: Blockchain Infrastructure, Digital Evidence, Enterprise Adoption,
  Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN), and the intersection of AI, Crypto,
  and Blockchain.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Digital Evidence Product Launch**: Constellation has productized its technology,
  born from years of federal government work, into "Digital Evidence," an API service
  designed to provide immutable proof/audit trails for real-world data and transactions.

  *   **Constellation Builder Program**: This new, free, open-source initiative allows
  developers (even non-coders using AI tools) to easily put streaming data onto the
  Constellation blockchain via an API, effectively offering a "roll your own" blockchain
  environment on their platform.

  *   **Scalable Big Data Focus**: Constellation positions itself as a scalable big
  data blockchain, contrasting with the limitations of networks like Bitcoin for complex
  enterprise applications.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Trust Deficit as Opportunity**: The current low level of public and enterprise
  trust (exacerbated by AI hallucinations and data misuse by large tech firms) creates
  an ideal market entry point for blockchain solutions offering immutable transparency.

  *   **Enterprise Readiness**: Demand from Fortune 500 companies for embedding blockchain
  practices into workflows has rapidly accelerated, shifting from initial curiosity
  to urgent implementation planning.

  *   **Micro-services Economy**: The future sweet spot lies in the convergence of
  AI and blockchain, enabling secure, auditable micro-payments, micro-services, and
  micro-investments, exemplified by use cases like rewarding customers interacting
  with AI help desks.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Constellation Network**: Founded in 2017, focused on building usable, unstoppable
  blockchain infrastructure.

  *   **Federal Government/DOD**: Constellation has been contracting with the Department
  of Defense and other agencies since 2019, validating their technology as secure
  and scalable.

  *   **Dave Burn (CPO)**: Credited as the "mind child" behind the new Builder program.

  *   **Other L1s**: Diggles expressed support for Hedera, Avalanche, and Polygon,
  emphasizing that "there''s not one blockchain to rule them all."

  *   **Base Ecosystem**: Constellation is actively collaborating within the Coinbase
  Base ecosystem.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   The work with federal agencies established Constellation’s infrastructure as
  **DOD approved**, suggesting a strong foundation for compliance and handling sensitive
  data, which is crucial for enterprise adoption.

  *   The focus on immutable logging inherently sets organizations up for better compliance
  on the "defense" side of future regulatory scrutiny.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  *   The industry is moving toward a necessary **overlay of trust** provided by blockchain
  technology, especially as AI systems become more critical in decision-making.

  *   The long-term vision involves tokenizing community efforts and rewarding positive
  user behavior via micro-incentives, moving beyond purely speculative crypto use
  cases.

  *   The conversation suggests a maturation where blockchain adoption will mirror
  the slow but inevitable transition seen with cloud computing adoption.


  **7. Target Audience**: Blockchain infrastructure developers, enterprise technology
  leaders, Web3 strategists, and investors tracking real-world utility and enterprise
  blockchain adoption.

  **Comprehensive Narrative Summary:**


  Benjamin Diggles framed Constellation Network as the "biggest blockchain project
  you''ve never heard of," emphasizing their six-year history of building mission-critical
  infrastructure for the US federal government, which validated their technology''s
  security and scalability. This government validation paved the way for the commercial
  launch of **Digital Evidence**, a product designed to restore trust in an era plagued
  by misinformation and AI hallucinations.


  Diggles argues that the current global trust deficit—affecting consumers viewing
  digital media and enterprises relying on AI inputs—makes blockchain''s core promise
  of immutability more valuable than ever. This demand is driving Fortune 500 companies
  to actively seek blockchain integration.


  To facilitate this adoption, Constellation launched the **Builder Program**, offering
  a free, open-source API service allowing anyone to easily place data on-chain without
  writing complex code, even leveraging AI tools for setup. This is positioned as
  a low-friction entry point for developers to understand the value of an immutable
  audit trail.


  Zooming out, Diggles detailed his ultimate vision: the **cross-section of AI, Crypto,
  and Blockchain**. He sees this convergence enabling a robust economy built on **micro-services**,
  where users interacting with AI-driven services (like customer support bots) can
  be instantly rewarded with fungible currency for beneficial actions, all logged
  securely via Digital Evidence.


  Finally, Diggles adopted a pragmatic view on the broader crypto ecosystem, supporting
  interoperability between L1s and viewing meme coins as a necessary, albeit messy,
  early stage of **tokenizing community efforts**. He highlighted that beneath the
  speculation, projects with genuine community missions (like the "Christ is King"
  partnership) represent the evolved, valuable future of community tokens.'
