summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Turning Healthcare Innovation into Real Patient
  Impact - with Brad Kennedy of Orlando Health


  This episode of the AI and Business Podcast, featuring Brad Kennedy, Senior Director
  of Business Solution Strategy at Orlando Health, focused on the critical intersection
  of patient experience, technology adoption (particularly AI/automation), and strategic
  investment within the highly regulated healthcare environment. The core narrative
  moved from the foundational importance of patient feedback to the practical challenges
  and strategic requirements for deploying emerging technologies like agenteic AI
  in clinical settings.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centered on **Healthcare Technology Adoption and Strategy**, specifically
  examining how patient experience metrics drive innovation investment, the challenges
  of integrating new technologies (like robotics and AI) into clinical workflows,
  and the strategic positioning of emerging AI capabilities, such as clinical decision
  support and future agenteic systems.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **AI as Clinical Decision Support (CDS):** The most promising current use of
  AI in healthcare is not replacing physician decisions but acting as a CDS tool.
  Effective AI synthesizes numerous patient factors into quick recommendations (e.g.,
  flagging a potential diagnosis or surgical candidacy) that the physician then validates,
  maintaining human agency and accountability.

  *   **Distinction in AI Applications:** The conversation highlighted that AI technologies
  vary widely—from administrative uses (like billing transparency) to highly complex
  systems (like robotic surgery guidance)—and must be evaluated based on their specific
  substance, not just the underlying machine learning.

  *   **Agentic AI Headwinds:** While agenteic AI is on the horizon, the primary challenge
  for healthcare professionals will be ensuring these systems enhance workflows without
  compromising the provider''s decision-making authority or introducing new forms
  of friction or accountability gaps.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Patient Experience as a Financial Driver:** Patient experience metrics, formalized
  by CMS through surveys like HCAHPS and associated star ratings, are no longer just
  quality measures; they are increasingly tied to revenue under the shift from fee-for-service
  to **value-based care** contracts.

  *   **Quantifiable ROI is Mandatory for Buy-in:** Any proposed innovation, especially
  AI, must be supported by objective, quantifiable outcomes related to improving experience,
  enhancing outcomes, or driving efficiency (impacting the bottom line). Proposals
  lacking specific metrics are "dead in the water."

  *   **Stakeholder Alignment is Crucial:** Securing wholesale buy-in across legal,
  IT, and clinical teams requires answering the "what''s in it for me" question for
  each group, often through early, collaborative development (e.g., involving nurses
  when designing a new unit-based solution).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Brad Kennedy (Orlando Health):** Senior Director of Business Solution Strategy,
  providing the perspective of a large, not-for-profit health network navigating innovation
  strategy.

  *   **CMS (Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services):** The key regulatory body driving
  accountability for patient experience through the **HCAHPS** survey system.

  *   **Productive Edge:** The episode sponsor.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a model where patient engagement and experience are
  inseparable from clinical outcomes, necessitating technology investments that bridge
  communication gaps (e.g., virtual care). The next wave of AI adoption will require
  health systems to carefully vet **agenteic systems** to ensure they serve as powerful
  assistants rather than autonomous decision-makers, thereby safeguarding the Hippocratic
  oath and maintaining provider trust.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Healthcare Executives, Innovation Leaders,
  Strategy Officers, and Technology Vendors** focused on enterprise deployment within
  regulated clinical environments. It is relevant for professionals interested in
  the practical realities of AI adoption, stakeholder management, and linking technology
  investment directly to patient-centric business outcomes.'
