    LLMs, or agents).

summary: '## EP 556: Choosing the Right AI: Agents, LLMs, or Algorithms? - Comprehensive
  Summary


  This episode of the Everyday AI Show, featuring Michael Abramov (CEO of KeyMaker
  and KeyLabs), serves as a practical guide for business leaders navigating the confusing
  landscape of modern AI technologies, emphasizing experimentation over rigid adherence
  to buzzwords.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **demystifying and providing a framework for selecting the
  appropriate AI technology**—specifically contrasting traditional **Algorithms**,
  **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Agents**, and **Agentic AI**—based on specific
  business needs rather than hype. The discussion also touches upon the critical role
  of high-quality data preparation (Michael’s expertise) and the competitive dynamics
  of the AI talent market.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **LLMs as Black Boxes:** An LLM is fundamentally defined as a "black box" model
  capable of answering questions, serving as a foundational component.

  *   **Agents as Decision Trees:** Agents are conceptualized as automated workflows
  comprising multiple models linked by hard-coded logic (if/else statements) to perform
  complex tasks (e.g., planning a trip by checking bank balance, weather, and flights
  sequentially).

  *   **Agentic AI as Dynamic Logic:** Agentic AI is a concept where the decision-making
  logic (the if/else structure) within an agent is dynamically determined and orchestrated
  by a separate, supervisory model, rather than being pre-programmed.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **The Danger of Hype and "Corporate Blade":** There is significant overpromising
  on social media regarding immediate employee replacement. Furthermore, many startups
  building wrappers or plugins around foundational LLMs (like Perplexity wrapping
  ChatGPT) risk being quickly "blade-cut" (obliterated) when major players integrate
  those features directly.

  *   **Data Quality is Paramount:** Regardless of the AI chosen (algorithm, LLM,
  or agent), the quality, structure, and correct perception of data used for training
  or decision-making remain the most critical factors.

  *   **Risk in Agentic AI Adoption:** The Gartner prediction that 40% of agentic
  AI projects will be canceled by 2027 highlights risks stemming from high costs,
  unclear business value, or insufficient risk controls, especially when agents operate
  with complex, autonomous loops.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Michael Abramov (KeyMaker/KeyLabs):** Guest expert specializing in data labeling
  and preparing training datasets for various AI models.

  *   **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** Mentioned due to the departure of a key Gen AI
  leader (Vasi Filiman) amid intense talent competition.

  *   **Meta:** Highlighted for winning a significant copyright lawsuit regarding
  the use of copyrighted books to train its Llama model, establishing a "fair use"
  precedent in that specific ruling.

  *   **OpenAI:** Noted for releasing deep research models (GPT-4 deep research, GPT-4
  mini deep research) and webhooks for its API, expanding advanced capabilities to
  developers.

  *   **Anthropic:** Mentioned for securing an $8 billion stake from Amazon and also
  winning a similar copyright ruling regarding training data use.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that the industry faces both **known unknowns** (speculation
  around AGI leading to mass unemployment vs. universal leisure) and **unknown unknowns**—paradigm-shifting
  innovations that are currently unimaginable, much like engineers in the Zeppelin
  era could not conceive of the airplane. The immediate future requires businesses
  to focus on practical application rather than theoretical endpoints like AGI.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Business Leaders, CTOs, Product Managers,
  and AI Strategy Professionals** who need actionable guidance on evaluating and implementing
  AI solutions beyond the current buzzwords.

  ### Comprehensive Narrative Summary


  The podcast addresses the overwhelming complexity facing business leaders trying
  to select the right AI tool—be it a traditional algorithm, a foundational LLM, or
  the newer concept of autonomous agents. Host Jordan Wilson sets the stage by acknowledging
  the alphabet soup of AI terminology.


  Michael Abramov advises against chasing trends, likening the choice to selecting
  a life partner—it must suit evolving needs. His core recommendation is **radical,
  personal experimentation**: leaders must dedicate time daily to play with available
  tools, ignoring the jargon (LLMs vs. Agents) initially, and focus only on solving
  their most painful, immediate problems. Once a solution is validated personally,
  it should be shared with the team.


  Abramov then clarifies the technical distinctions: LLMs are the core predictive
  models; Agents are systems where multiple models interact via hard-coded decision
  trees (if/else logic); and Agentic AI is when a supervisor model dynamically programs
  those decision trees. He uses the analogy of daily life decisions (waking a child)
  to illustrate the concept of decision trees inherent in agents.


  A significant portion of the discussion centers on **data integrity**. Abramov stresses
  that being "data-driven" is often misunderstood, leading to "pseudo-data-driven"
  conclusions where individuals force data to support their pre-existing perceptions—a
  problem his data-labeling company frequently encounters.


  Regarding the current rush toward agentic AI, Abramov supports the Gartner finding
  that many projects will fail due to unsustainable models or being outcompeted by
  giants. He introduces the "corporate blade" concept, where large tech companies
  rapidly absorb successful startup innovations built on top of foundational models.


  Finally, when asked about the path beyond current technology, Abramov distinguishes
  between **known unknowns** (AGI scenarios) and **unknown unknowns**—truly revolutionary
  concepts that cannot even be predicted based on current technological trajectories,
  using the analogy of airship engineers failing to predict'
