summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Become an AI & Suite First Enterprise with SAP
  Databricks in SAP Business Data Cloud | feat. San Tran


  This 30-minute episode of "Unlocking SAP BTP" focuses on the strategic integration
  of **Databricks within the SAP Business Data Cloud (BDC)**, positioning it as a
  critical enabler for enterprises aiming to become **AI-first and suite-first**.
  The discussion, featuring San Tran from SAP Business Data Cloud Product Management,
  details the architecture, technical benefits, and strategic implications of this
  expanded partnership.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **SAP Business Data Fabric architecture** within the SAP
  Business Data Cloud, specifically detailing how the **SAP Databricks** offering
  caters to data scientists and AI engineers by providing immediate, AI-ready access
  to core SAP line-of-business (LOB) data products, thereby accelerating AI/ML initiatives.
  Secondary topics include recent updates to SAP BTP services (like Document AI and
  hyperscaler availability) and upcoming roadmap items.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **AI-Ready Data Access:** The integration allows Databricks to directly access
  SAP-managed **Business Data Products** without the traditional cumbersome steps
  of data replication, ETL, and transformation, making LOB data immediately AI-ready
  for consumption.

  *   **Persona-Specific Tooling:** SAP Databricks provides the necessary **Pro Code
  development environment** (SQL analytics, Python notebooks, MLflow) tailored for
  data scientists, filling a tooling gap within the broader SAP ecosystem.

  *   **Zero-Copy Sharing via BDC Connect:** The upcoming **BDC Connect** feature,
  set for release around October, will enable bi-directional, zero-copy sharing between
  BDC and external Enterprise Databricks instances, facilitating the combination of
  SAP and non-SAP data for holistic ML development.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Holistic Data Strategy:** The Business Data Fabric architecture addresses
  core customer challenges: managing diverse, high-volume data, consolidating SAP/non-SAP
  sources, and ensuring data has necessary semantic context for decision-making.

  *   **Maximizing BW Investment:** The integration allows long-time SAP BW customers
  to leverage their existing logic and data assets by exposing them as modern Data
  Products within BDC, supporting their digital transformation journey without discarding
  prior investments.

  *   **Differentiated AI Deployment:** By leveraging both SAP Databricks (for data
  science workflows) and the core SAP Business AI foundation (for scalable, secure,
  and integrated deployment into business applications), enterprises can achieve a
  comprehensive AI strategy.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **San Tran:** Product Management expert in SAP Business Data Cloud, providing
  deep insights into the partnership and architecture.

  *   **SAP Databricks:** The co-engineered offering that integrates Databricks capabilities
  into the SAP cloud data strategy.

  *   **SAP Business Data Cloud (BDC):** The overarching platform built around the
  Business Data Fabric architecture.

  *   **SAP Business AI:** The broader SAP strategy encompassing AI foundation, conversational
  AI agents, and knowledge graphs.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward tightly integrated, yet specialized, data platforms
  where core enterprise data (SAP) is instantly accessible to best-of-breed AI/ML
  tooling (Databricks). The emphasis on **zero-copy data sharing** signals a future
  where data movement is minimized, and governance remains centralized while specialized
  compute environments are utilized. SAP plans to continue expanding the ecosystem
  via BDC Connect to include more external partners.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Enterprise Architects, Data Scientists, AI/ML
  Engineers, SAP BTP Developers, and CIO/CTO leadership** responsible for data governance,
  cloud strategy, and implementing enterprise-wide AI initiatives.

  ### Comprehensive Narrative Summary


  The podcast episode opens with brief updates on SAP BTP, highlighting improvements
  in **SAP Document AI** (better extraction, built-in support) and the general availability
  of key services (Integration Suite, Build, HANA Cloud) across major hyperscalers.


  The core discussion then shifts to the strategic partnership between SAP and Databricks,
  framed by the **SAP Business Data Cloud (BDC)**. San Tran explains that customers
  face complex challenges in organizing data for modern insights, requiring a holistic
  strategy—the **Business Data Fabric architecture**. This fabric is composed of five
  pillars: Analytics (SAC), Business Semantics (Data Sphere), BW Modernization, AI
  Capabilities (SAP Databricks), and the **Data Product Economy**.


  The Data Product Economy is highlighted as crucial, offering standardized, SAP-managed
  data directly from LOB applications, eliminating manual replication. SAP Databricks
  is introduced as the component specifically designed to serve the **data scientist
  persona**. It integrates seamlessly with BDC, granting immediate access to these
  standardized data products, enabling workflows like cash flow forecasting and attrition
  analysis directly on SAP data using Databricks’ ML tooling (MLflow, notebooks).


  A key technical distinction is made between **SAP Databricks** (an OEM subset optimized
  for SAP-centric workloads, maintained under SAP security/governance) and **Enterprise
  Databricks**. The upcoming **BDC Connect** feature is presented as the bridge, enabling
  zero-copy data sharing between the two environments, allowing customers to combine
  SAP data with their existing non-SAP data lakes for comprehensive ML projects.


  Finally, the conversation clarifies the relationship between SAP Databricks and
  **SAP Business AI**. While Databricks excels at the **training, modeling, and inferencing**
  phases of ML, the core Business AI foundation focuses on **operationalizing AI at
  scale** within productive business applications, ensuring security and compliance.
  The episode concludes with roadmap items for Data Sphere, HANA Cloud (near-'
