  text: I joked about a month ago and put out a little bit of satire, which was that
    we need to think about the risk-free rate having a totally different definition
    now, and we now have to go around and call it the risk-full rate to start really
    normalizing that idea, like the risk-free rate of the dollar, which is obviously
    kind of the thing that's at risk...

    the shift toward crypto/gold as necessary portfolio components is reaching the

  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Vanguard now is kind of capitulating and waving the white flag. I mean, you
    just go through and you're just like, 'Okay, hold on a second here. This now feels
    like there is no longer a debate about this, that people realize the dollar and
    bonds are going to have a lot of trouble moving forward, and therefore Bitcoin
    and gold are definitely benefiting.'
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: Critiques the traditional financial framing of Bitcoin. Highlights
    the philosophical difference between short-term trading and Bitcoin's long-term,
    permanent store-of-value nature.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Opportunistic growth. I thought that was funny. Why? Number one, 'opportunistic'
    implies as if this is like a temporal event-driven dislocation... Anyone who's
    been around long enough knows this is actually the opposite of opportunistic;
    it's evergreen as it comes. It's the store of value, it's permanent. You should
    have that always.

    idea of self-custodial ownership, to which anyone who owns Bitcoin, I think, will
    find that aspect much easier to do.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We think all roads lead to Bitcoin, right? In my opinion. That's why people
    also have said within the crypto VC industry that altcoins have been on the margin
    great because at some level, those who find success in altcoins eventually allocate
    some portion back to Bitcoin regardless. Wealth creation leads to Bitcoin as part
    of the denominator.
  topic: Investment
- impact_reason: Extends the 'altcoin funnel' concept to include gold, suggesting
    that any successful non-fiat asset class will eventually see capital migrate to

  topic: Investment
- impact_reason: Directly promotes a specific Bitcoin DeFi/scaling solution (Staked)
    that allows users to earn yield while maintaining self-custody ('no bridging,
    no lending, just holding'), addressing a major Web3 need for Bitcoin utility.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: 'You can earn yield on your Bitcoin by just holding your Bitcoin. It''s simple.
    Staked, the leading Bitcoin scaling solution, will reward you for not selling
    your Bitcoin. It''s not magic. Here''s how it works: Staked is a protocol secured
    by elected validators. You can help elect validators and secure the network by
    simply locking up your Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchainâ€”no bridging, no lending,
    just holding.'
  topic: DeFi/Technology
- impact_reason: Proposes a shift from the traditional Debt-to-GDP ratio to the GDP-to-Liquidity
    ratio, framing liquidity as the key metric for understanding refinancing risk
    in a high-debt environment.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What you really need to focus is the GDP-to-liquidity ratio because liquidity
    itself represents the duration of refinancing risk that is now being more meticulously
    challenged by the oversupply of global debt.
  topic: investment/strategy

    under a ''wartime economy construct'' where sovereign risk is paramount and weaponized,
    contrasting sharply with peacetime assumptions.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Man, how symbolic is that to the conversation we're just having from the beginning,
    where the sovereign risk is becoming the risk in which all of these things are
    weaponizing the economy, where I think everything about the financial system today
    is like a wartime economy construct, not a peacetime economy construct?
  topic: strategy/investment

    information can reduce societal polarization by forcing engagement with probabilistic,
    nuanced data rather than binary opinions.'
  relevance_score: 10

  text: So, the question is becoming actually news information, which means if you

    black and white, you need to start financializing it and then see the grains of
    the news items to which people can make smart, educated, probable finance and
    information is happening.
  topic: web3/adoption

    of colonization,'' framing the fight for data ownership as essential for individual
    empowerment against Big Tech (FANGs).'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And at the center of that is that reality that data is kind of the last frontier
    of colonization. That's all we have left. You and I have valuable data. It's the
    one thing we can empower ourselves to find productivity in, and what can you do
    about it that's not going to be consumed by the FANGs of the world that you get
    to own and exercise the right to earn an income off?
  topic: web3/ownership
- impact_reason: Details the mechanism of Staked, emphasizing security via elected
    validators and the key benefit of 'no bridging, no lending,' which mitigates common
    DeFi risks for Bitcoin holders.
  relevance_score: 10

  text: Staked is a protocol secured by elected validators. You can help elect validators
    and secure the network by simply locking up your Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchainâ€”no
    bridging, no lending, just holding.
  topic: technology/DeFi
- impact_reason: This is a strong statement positioning Bitcoin as the superior store
    of value, even relative to gold, implying gold's current valuation is artificially
    suppressed by Bitcoin's existence. It's a core bullish thesis for Bitcoin maximalists.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Gold may actually be like 8 to 10,000 dollars an ounce if Bitcoin didn't exist.
    What do you think? All roads lead to Bitcoin, right? In my opinion.
  topic: Investment Thesis
- impact_reason: This reclassifies gold as a secondary, or 'altcoin,' asset relative
    to Bitcoin in the context of modern wealth allocation, suggesting Bitcoin is the
    primary destination for new wealth seeking a non-sovereign store of value.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Wealth creation leads to Bitcoin as part of the denominator. And so in some
    sense, gold is also an altcoin in my opinion.
  topic: Investment Thesis
- impact_reason: A powerful declaration that US domestic political risk is no longer
    the primary market driver; global fiscal policy and sovereign debt issues now
    dominate the narrative.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The US government shutdown is not the story anymore that kind of drives global
    markets. Nobody cares. Nobody cares. Nobody cares. It actually shows you, I think
    the center of gravity has changed from that being driven by market-first principles
    of what the US stock market would do by investor flows to actually one that is
    driven by global fiscal dominance across every sovereign actor...
  topic: Strategy
- impact_reason: Indicates a societal shift from hoping for fiscal responsibility
    to accepting the current trajectory and focusing on individual hedging strategies
    (like Bitcoin/gold).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think there used to be a time when people really wanted to talk about like
    how do we cut down Social Security, how do we cut down these things and bring
    fiscal health. And I think if you ask an average person on the street whether
    this is on people's minds anymore, I don't think it is. People have accepted that
    this is actually what's happening. And now it's up to you individually to figure
    out how to best navigate that for your own personal self-preservation.

    portfolios and they're inflating asset prices. Paul Tudor Jones was very bullish
    on CNBC this week talking about things like Bitcoin and gold...
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: Highlights the technical validation of Bitcoin within established
    financial frameworks (Modern Portfolio Theory), moving it beyond a speculative
    asset into a portfolio optimization tool.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The part that was really kind of amazing there is one, I think we've been
    so excited and wanting to see private wealth management and financial advisors
    come to embrace Bitcoin as an allocation, and then we're going to see Bitcoin
    as an allocation in what is pushing out the efficient frontier of modern portfolio
    theory.
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: This signals significant institutional validation and adoption pressure
    from the wealth management sector, driven by client demand.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We saw Morgan Stanley now say that a two to four percent allocation is something
    that they want to support their 16,000 financial advisors in doing because they're

  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: A strong assertion that the traditional safe-haven assets (USD/bonds)
    are losing ground, cementing the narrative for Bitcoin and gold as necessary hedges.
  relevance_score: 9

    the dollar and bonds are going to have a lot of trouble moving forward, and therefore

- impact_reason: A specific forward-looking prediction emphasizing the necessity of
    non-fiat stores of value in the near future.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: In 2025, the idea of having a store of value in your portfolio that isn't
    dollar-denominated is a key story.
  topic: Prediction
- impact_reason: Declares a fundamental shift in investor behavior away from the dollar
    as the ultimate safety asset, a core thesis for Bitcoin.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: That paradigm has fundamentally changed. I don't think people are looking
    for dollar-denominated assets.
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: Presents a nuanced view that gold's success validates the broader
    asset class (non-sovereign hard assets), paving the way for Bitcoin's eventual
    outperformance.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Gold's success is good for Bitcoin. I have always shared with people that
    we must root for some success of gold to the outcome that we're driving about
    self-sovereignty, and then the journey advances once people realize that there
    are different trade-offs to which Bitcoin can outperform even gold.
  topic: Strategy
- impact_reason: A provocative thought experiment suggesting Bitcoin acts as a massive
    capital sink, inflating the value of gold by providing an alternative store of
    value for capital that would otherwise flow into gold.

    dollars an ounce if Bitcoin didn't exist.
  topic: Investment
- impact_reason: Provides stark macroeconomic context comparing the 1999 tech bubble
    backdrop (low debt, growth) to the current environment (high debt, sovereign flow
    driven), arguing the current situation is fundamentally different and more precarious.
  relevance_score: 9

  text: In 1999, the US GDP was growing on the back of globalization as a trend, and
    the debt-to-GDP ratio was around 40%. It's a healthy market to grow into, right?
    Now, it's 120%; we're over one.
  topic: Strategy
- impact_reason: Identifies sovereign/institutional flows, backed by government action
    (taking stakes in companies), as the primary driver of current market overvaluation,
    contrasting sharply with 1999's private sector euphoria.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This overvaluation and the stretch is not just coming from the private sector
    and individual investors; it's really coming from institutional flows. There's
    no more prime example to share on that beyond the fact that the US government
    is proactively taking stakes in public companies here in this country at this
    moment.
  topic: Regulation/Strategy
- impact_reason: Highlights the critical importance of monitoring non-Western, specifically
    Chinese, liquidity dynamics for a complete global macro picture, moving beyond
    traditional Western-centric financial analysis.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think global liquidity is like a bit of a catch-all for a lot of things
    people are paying attention to. For me, I definitely pay attention to the construct
    outside of the Western paradigm, so looking in towards China and what they're
    doing with their liquidity machine is pretty important.
  topic: investment/strategy

    fall) are a direct trigger for liquidity issues via collateral haircut levels,
    more so than just equity volatility (VIX).'

  text: So, funding-based liquidity models are really important. So, to that extent,
    looking at not just the VIX for equities index fall, but looking at the rates
    fall is huge because the rates fall is the thing that is applied on the collateral
    haircut levels that cause liquidity issues.

    skills beyond mere financial gain.

  text: We must learn how to invest in a professional way that might also be called
    professional gambling. And professional gambling really sounds like a negative
    word, but I really mean it when I say just like you have to understand accounting
    and mortgage math and how to save money and how interest works, you must also
    learn how to bet in life because betting is actually a probabilistic exercise
    that is so good for you outside of just a monetary outcome.

    So imagine a bridge that's the height of the World Trade Center just going through

summary: '## Podcast Summary: The New Bitcoin Trade Everyone Is Doing | Jeff Park


  This 37-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast, featuring Jeff Park (CIO at ProCAP BTC),
  centers on the accelerating **de-dollarization trade**, the shifting global economic
  gravity away from US fiscal dominance, and why Bitcoin is emerging as a primary
  beneficiary alongside gold.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**: Macroeconomics, Global Finance, Digital Assets (Bitcoin/Gold),
  and Geopolitical Shifts. The core theme is the perceived decline of the US dollar''s
  global standing due to persistent fiscal expansion ("governments going broke") and
  the resulting investor migration toward non-sovereign stores of value.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Gold as an "Altcoin"**: The discussion posits that if Bitcoin did not exist,
  the market cap and price of gold would likely be significantly higher (estimated
  at $8kâ€“$10k per ounce), suggesting Bitcoin is currently siphoning capital that might
  otherwise flow solely into gold.

  *   **Bitcoin as the Denominator**: Wealth creation, even from successful altcoins
  or gold investments, is increasingly being allocated back into Bitcoin as the ultimate,
  non-sovereign denominator in a diversified portfolio.

  *   **Self-Custody Advantage**: Bitcoinâ€™s inherent ease of self-custody is highlighted
  as a superior feature compared to traditional gold holdings (like GLD ETFs), especially
  during tail-risk events where physical access or counterparty risk becomes paramount.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **The De-Dollarization Trade is Mainstream**: Institutional recognition (Morgan
  Stanley, Ken Griffin, Paul Tudor Jones) confirms that investors are actively de-dollarizing
  portfolios, moving capital into assets like Bitcoin and gold as hedges against inflation
  and sovereign debt concerns.

  *   **Re-evaluating the Risk-Free Rate**: The traditional "risk-free rate" of the
  dollar/US bonds is now being reframed as the "risk-full rate," justifying investors
  taking higher risks on other assets because the perceived safety premium on bonds
  is eroding.

  *   **Bitcoin vs. Gold Momentum**: While gold has shown strong short-term momentum,
  Bitcoinâ€™s multi-year outperformance (10x gold over five years) suggests it remains
  the superior long-term store of value, despite younger investors often preferring
  Bitcoin''s higher volatility/momentum profile.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Jeff Park (CIO, ProCAP BTC)**: The guest, providing the core analysis on fiscal
  dominance and asset allocation shifts.

  *   **Anthony Pompliano (Host)**: Driving the conversation around macro trends and
  Bitcoin adoption.

  *   **Paul Tudor Jones & Ken Griffin**: Cited as major institutional figures publicly
  acknowledging the de-dollarization trend and Bitcoinâ€™s role.

  *   **Morgan Stanley**: Mentioned for advising financial advisors to allocate 2-4%
  to Bitcoin, though amusingly categorized as "opportunistic growth" rather than "evergreen
  value."

  *   **Tether**: Noted for launching products linking institutional exposure to both
  gold and Bitcoin performance.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   The conversation focuses less on direct regulation and more on the **policy
  outcomes** of fiscal dominance. The normalization of US government shutdowns and
  global fiscal expansion (e.g., Japan''s new PM promising to "print money forever")
  is seen as the primary driver forcing investors to seek non-sovereign hedges.

  *   The perceived lack of seriousness regarding US credit downgrades (Moody''s threat)
  underscores the diminishing power of traditional financial gatekeepers.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  *   The center of gravity in global markets is shifting from being driven by US
  stock market flows to being driven by **global fiscal dominance and industrial production**
  (contrasting US political gridlock with China''s industrial might).

  *   The AI trade and productive utility assets are seen as the other major capital
  flow destination, running parallel to the de-dollarization trade.

  *   The market is moving toward accepting that non-dollar-denominated assets are
  necessary for personal self-preservation in the current fiscal environment.


  **7. Target Audience**:

  This content is highly valuable for **Financial Professionals, Macro Hedge Fund
  Managers, Institutional Investors, and sophisticated Crypto Investors** who need
  to understand the intersection of geopolitical risk, sovereign debt dynamics, and
  digital asset allocation strategies.'
