    It's what most software engineers learn in their education, basically how it works
    if I were just to put an analogy down is if you have a hundred guys and try and
    find an end of the maze, you just send these hundred guys to find different paths...
    This does mean that there's a lot of restrictions. You can't pull up pools in
    there. You can't get into lower chunks.

  text: I think the main reason why you haven't seen a lot of the EVM, I guess, Dex

    really does count.

summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - Titan is a Metadex aggregator on Solana that sits above Dex aggregators (like
    Jupiter and D-flow), routing trades to the best performing router.
  - Titan's proprietary Dex aggregator, Argos, claims to outperform other routers
    70-75% of the time due to a pure math optimization routing algorithm, unlike competitors
    who use less precise chunking methods.
  - The team's background is in low-latency analytics from traditional finance, which
    they argue is crucial for optimizing performance on Solana's high-speed chain.
  - Titan will not charge direct commission fees, instead planning to monetize through
    models inspired by traditional finance, such as payment for order flow (PFOF)
    mechanisms.
  - Titan is launching 'Prime Mode,' an automated execution setting designed to be
    MEV-protected and handle slippage management, similar to Jupiter Ultra.
  - The initial target audience is sophisticated traders and whales who are most sensitive
    to basis point improvements in execution price.
  - The long-term focus is narrowly set on optimizing the spot market infrastructure,
    contrasting with Jupiter's 'super app' strategy.
  overview: Titan, a newly launched Solana Metadex aggregator, announced a $7 million
    seed round, positioning itself to challenge established Dex aggregators like Jupiter
    by leveraging a proprietary, pure math optimization routing algorithm. This advanced
    routing claims to outperform competitors approximately 70-75% of the time by avoiding
    the chunking limitations common in existing algorithms. Titan aims to become the
    "Interactive Brokers of on-chain capital markets," focusing on providing superior
    price execution for sophisticated traders without charging direct commission fees.
