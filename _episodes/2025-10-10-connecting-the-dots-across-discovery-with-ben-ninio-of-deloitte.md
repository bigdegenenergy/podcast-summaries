    enough compute in the world because these are quantum systems. They're really,
    really complex, and we kind of, we just, we can't do it anymore.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Connecting the Dots Across Discovery - with
  Ben Ninio of Deloitte


  This 22-minute episode of the AI and Business Podcast, featuring **Benjamin Ninio,
  Principal and Strategy at Deloitte**, focuses on how AI, particularly leveraging
  language models, is fundamentally transforming Research and Development (R&D) across
  sectors like life sciences and agriculture by creating unified discovery frameworks.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the application of **AI and Large Language Models (LLMs)**
  to accelerate **scientific discovery and R&D innovation**. Key themes include overcoming
  computational limitations in modeling complex systems (like proteins), the role
  of **language as a unifying framework**, and the power of **multimodal data** to
  unlock cross-domain insights.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Language as the Computational "Hack":** Instead of relying solely on brute-force
  computation for modeling quantum-level complex systems (which quickly hits compute
  limits), LLMs utilize the predictive power inherent in *language* (whether English
  or the "language" of biology/molecules) to make better, probabilistic guesses about
  outcomes, significantly improving the efficiency of hypothesis generation.

  *   **Multimodal Data Abstraction:** The most exciting developments involve training
  algorithms on **multimodal data**—combining different "languages" such as English
  text, protein structures, music, and soil health data. This allows models to form
  connections and reach levels of abstraction beyond human intuition.

  *   **Mitigating Hallucinations via Knowledge Graphs:** While hallucinations are
  a concern, they can be materially reduced by **tying LLMs back into structured knowledge
  graphs**. The goal is not perfect output but generating a higher percentage of viable
  experimental candidates (moving from 1% success rate to 2% or 3%).


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **R&D Efficiency Leap:** By improving the success rate of initial R&D experiments
  (even marginally), the value generated across society is enormous, given that typically
  only about 1% of R&D ideas make it to fruition.

  *   **Data Unification is Key:** R&D leaders must address disconnected data systems
  and domain-specific silos. The greatest value emerges when public data insights
  are combined with an organization''s own bespoke, historic R&D data.

  *   **AI-First Discovery is the Future:** The conversation suggests that scientific
  discovery will be the most profoundly impacted area of society due to AI''s ability
  to abstract and accelerate understanding of nature.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Benjamin Ninio (Deloitte):** The guest, offering a strategic perspective on
  applying AI to R&D challenges.

  *   **Deloitte:** Sponsoring the R&D data insights series, focusing on practical
  application.

  *   **Brian Loots (Corteva):** Mentioned as a previous guest who highlighted the
  exponential possibilities in agro-science proteins (e.g., $10^{18}$ to $10^{60}$
  options).

  *   **Yoshua Bengio & CIO of Goldman Sachs/Head of AI at Raytheon:** Mentioned in
  the podcast''s promotional segment as examples of past high-profile guests.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward an **AI-first discovery model** where the speed of
  capability doubling for LLMs is cited as every three months. The future involves
  a **combination of machine and human intelligence**, where AI handles complex abstraction
  and prediction, allowing humans to focus on validation and decision-making. This
  shift is expected to be more impactful than the initial Internet revolution.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **R&D Leaders, CIOs, Strategy Executives, and
  Technology Professionals** in highly technical or regulated industries (Life Sciences,
  Pharma, Agriculture, Industrial Chemistry) who are navigating the adoption of AI
  for core innovation processes. It is less focused on entry-level engineering and
  more on strategic deployment and business impact.'
