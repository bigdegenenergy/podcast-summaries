summary: '# Bits + Bips: Where Is the Most Wealth to Be Made in Crypto: DeFi or CeFi?
  - Ep. 913


  ## **Focus Area**

  This episode centers on the ongoing crypto bull market dynamics, comparing wealth
  creation opportunities between DeFi and CeFi, with deep dives into market sentiment,
  institutional adoption (particularly Swift''s Ethereum layer-2 initiative), and
  the evolving landscape of traditional finance integration with blockchain technology.


  ## **Key Technical Insights**

  • **Swift''s Ethereum Integration**: Swift is developing a layer-2 solution on Ethereum
  for international payments, marking a significant shift from traditional messaging
  systems to real-time blockchain settlement

  • **Stablecoin Infrastructure Evolution**: Discussion of how banks are implementing
  stablecoin banking services through companies like Stablecore and Aminia, integrating
  digital assets into legacy core banking systems

  • **Layer-2 Proliferation Concerns**: Growing skepticism about the proliferation
  of proprietary layer-2s by major companies (Stripe, Robinhood, Coinbase), potentially
  creating new "fiefdoms" rather than true decentralization


  ## **Market/Investment Angle**

  • **Bull Market Continuation**: Strong consensus that the crypto bull run is far
  from over, with Q4 historically being the strongest quarter and multiple macro factors
  supporting continued growth

  • **DeFi Wealth Creation Potential**: Prediction that "DeFi billionaires haven''t
  come yet" and will likely surpass CeFi wealth creation as the space matures

  • **Technical Support Levels**: Bitcoin showing strength with tactical buy points
  identified at $107K and $112K, while Ethereum holding above $4K demonstrates market
  resilience


  ## **Notable Companies/People**

  • **Robert Leshner** (Compound founder, Superstate CEO) - discussing tokenization
  and institutional adoption

  • **Bill Bahrt** (Avra CEO) - providing wealth management perspective on crypto
  markets

  • **Swift** - major focus on their Ethereum layer-2 development with ConsenSys

  • **Stablecore and Aminia** - emerging players helping banks integrate stablecoin
  services

  • **Traditional banks** including BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon testing blockchain
  integration


  ## **Regulatory/Policy Discussion**

  The conversation reveals that the "war between CBDCs and stablecoins" has largely
  been won by stablecoins, particularly in the US market. Government shutdown concerns
  are dismissed as typical political theater with minimal long-term market impact.
  The regulatory environment appears increasingly favorable for stablecoin adoption
  over central bank digital currencies.


  ## **Future Implications**

  The industry is moving toward a bifurcated future where crypto continues evolving
  as a parallel financial universe while select traditional institutions adapt through
  partnerships and infrastructure providers. The death of traditional correspondent
  banking seems inevitable as real-time blockchain settlement becomes standard. Regional
  and community banks face existential challenges, while mega banks and crypto-native
  institutions will dominate.


  ## **Target Audience**

  This episode is most valuable for crypto investors, DeFi participants, and traditional
  finance professionals seeking to understand institutional adoption trends and market
  dynamics during the current bull cycle.

  ## **Comprehensive Analysis**


  This episode of Bits + Bips captures a pivotal moment in crypto''s institutional
  adoption curve, with the hosts displaying cautious optimism about Q4 market prospects
  while dissecting the broader implications of traditional finance''s blockchain integration
  efforts.


  **Market Sentiment and Macro Outlook**

  The conversation opens with a strong bullish thesis for Q4, supported by technical
  indicators like improving funding rates, increasing open interest, and historical
  seasonality patterns. The hosts emphasize that despite recent volatility, Bitcoin''s
  ability to hold above $100K and Ethereum''s stability above $4K demonstrates market
  maturation. Bill Bahrt''s analysis of the Treasury General Account depletion and
  other macro factors reinforces the view that the current bull run has significant
  room to continue.


  **The Swift Paradigm Shift**

  Perhaps the most significant discussion centers on Swift''s announcement of building
  a layer-2 on Ethereum. This represents a fundamental shift from the traditional
  correspondent banking model to real-time blockchain settlement. The hosts view this
  as both validation of crypto''s infrastructure superiority and a potential threat
  to Swift''s long-term relevance. Robert Leshner''s perspective highlights the typical
  slow execution of large institutions, tempering expectations for immediate impact
  while acknowledging the strategic significance.


  **DeFi vs CeFi Wealth Creation**

  The episode''s central thesis emerges through discussions of where the next wave
  of crypto billionaires will emerge. The consensus suggests DeFi still offers superior
  wealth creation potential compared to CeFi, driven by the technology''s inherent
  advantages in efficiency, accessibility, and innovation speed. This perspective
  challenges the common assumption that institutional adoption necessarily benefits
  traditional players more than crypto-native participants.


  **Banking Industry Disruption**

  A particularly insightful segment explores how companies like Stablecore and Aminia
  are helping banks integrate stablecoin services, representing a picks-and-shovels
  approach to the crypto-banking convergence. However, the hosts express skepticism
  about regional banks'' long-term viability, suggesting that only mega banks and
  crypto-native institutions will thrive in the new paradigm.


  **Layer-2 Fragmentation Concerns**

  The discussion reveals growing concern about major companies creating proprietary
  layer-2 solutions, potentially undermining decentralization principles. This tension
  between scalability needs and decentralization ide'
