    and fill block space.'
  relevance_score: 10

  text: But we've now gotten to the place where we've created all this infrastructure
    for on-chain and demand for block space. But I don't think Crypto by ourselves
    can fill all that demand right now.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: Provides a crucial distinction between Robinhood Chain (potentially
    KYC-heavy/permissioned) and Base (permissionless/decentralized sequencer model),
    highlighting different approaches to on-chain finance.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think my understanding of what Robinhood is trying to do [with Robinhood
    Chain] is it's much more kind of a fed chain, almost in quotes. Unlike Base, where
    in theory and in practice, it's a sequencer, but in theory, everything, you don't
    have to do KYC for every single transaction...
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: 'Reveals Robinhood''s likely immediate goal for their chain: regulatory
    compliance (KYC integration) and leveraging on-chain rails for traditional capital
    market needs (leverage/working capital).'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Robinhood seems to very much not want to do that right now. They more so want
    to use it as a coordination layer and also kind of cook in these KYC systems,
    and much more so kind of use it as a way to tap capital for leverage or for the
    working capital requirements that they might tap into like a Jeffries, for example.
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: 'Provides a key strategic insight: Robinhood Chain''s initial purpose
    is likely international (European) expansion of their traditional brokerage offerings
    (tokenized stocks) by leveraging crypto rails to bypass existing infrastructure
    limitations.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And my read of it is, I actually think it's a way for them to actually grow
    more of the brokerage side of the business. So, Robinhood actually doesn't offer
    all the products that they offer in the US. They don't actually offer that in
    Europe right now. And this is actually a way for them to start offering things
    like equities and stock tokens and stock derivative tokens into Europe through
    this sort of on-chain effort.
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: 'Identifies the potential killer feature for a brokerage chain: enabling
    leverage/lending against tokenized traditional assets, which is currently difficult
    in TradFi.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I don't think we're going to do anything on Robinhood anytime soon, unless
    at some point, as previously mentioned, if they allow people to get leverage against
    Robinhood or other stocks, they open that up via the chain.
  topic: DeFi/Innovation
- impact_reason: 'Clearly states the primary benefit of on-chain infrastructure: enabling
    novel financial products like collateralized crypto loans that are difficult or
    impossible on Web2 rails.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: One is you can just offer new types of financial services when you have an
    on-chain strategy. So, if you're Base, you can offer things like Bitcoin-backed
    loans, which is powered by Morpho on Base.
  topic: DeFi/Innovation
- impact_reason: Paints a vivid, long-term vision for tokenized asset integration
    into DeFi primitives (borrowing/lending across asset classes).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But eventually, you can imagine that they might start doing some really weird
    and crazy stuff, like, hey, maybe you can borrow and lend by collateralizing your
    stock tokens, and maybe you can even borrow USDC, or even crazier, what if you
    collateralize Apple stock tokens and start to borrow like Bitcoin or ETH or something
    like that, right?
  topic: DeFi/Web3 Vision
- impact_reason: Suggests that financial incentives (free/cheap tech stack via token
    grants) played a significant, perhaps decisive, role in Coinbase's choice of the
    OP Stack.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think probably an aspect of it is, and both sides will probably hate this
    because it does really fit nicely into their narratives, but initially when Base
    decided to work with the OP Stack, it basically won. The OP Stack won because
    OP gave Coinbase an absurd amount of OP tokens in order to use that stack, which
    probably made the chain development costs net positive somehow, which is pretty
    crazy, or net negative in the sense that it didn't cost them any money.

  text: Robinhood is an equities-first company. They started off as basically offering
    really great UX for pro and retail traders. And I think more recently, they've
    added crypto trading as a capability into their product suite specifically for
    their users because their users probably want to trade crypto.

    crypto exchange. They do a lot of things that in traditional finance, if you look
    at Robinhood's flow of funds, say I place an order for Apple on Robinhood, that
    order kind of goes through Robinhood, but then it gets sold to Citadel, and then
    Citadel might settle it on an exchange, or clear—basically sell its exposure or
    not settle—and then the actual clearing of that exchange is then another company.
    Whereas with Coinbase right now, you interact with Coinbase on the user-facing
    side, the exchange is Coinbase, the execution side might be helped, but Coinbase
    has an execution desk built in when they bought Tagomi.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Coinbase and Robinhood Are Converging, but Who Wins
  the Onchain Fintech War? - Ep. 864


  This 85-minute episode of Unchained, hosted by Laura Shin, features Dio Kassaris
  (Founder of Clura Protocol) and Ryan Yee (formerly of Coinbase Ventures) discussing
  the intensifying competition between incumbent FinTech giants, specifically **Coinbase
  and Robinhood**, as they both aggressively move into on-chain infrastructure and
  tokenization. The central theme is how these established players are leveraging
  blockchain technology to expand their core businesses and capture new market share,
  particularly in the realm of tokenized traditional assets.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **convergence of traditional FinTech (brokerage/custody)
  and decentralized finance (DeFi)/Web3 infrastructure**. Key topics include the strategic
  implications of **Robinhood Chain** versus **Coinbase’s Base L2**, the tokenization
  of equities, and the differing motivations behind each company''s on-chain strategy.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Robinhood Chain Strategy:** Robinhood appears to be building a more centralized
  or "fed chain" (in quotes) focused on coordination and integrating KYC systems,
  potentially to facilitate the issuance of tokenized stocks and tap capital for leverage
  requirements.

  *   **Base vs. Robinhood Chain Philosophy:** Base operates as a decentralized sequencer
  (using the OP Stack) that theoretically avoids mandatory KYC per transaction, positioning
  itself as a true public blockchain for developers. Robinhood’s approach seems geared
  toward controlled infrastructure for regulated products.

  *   **EVM Preference Rationale:** Both Coinbase (Base) and Robinhood (rumored to
  have considered Solana but opted for an EVM L2 solution, likely Arbitrum) gravitating
  toward EVM-compatible L2s suggests a preference for a more controlled, familiar,
  and potentially less complex regulatory sandbox compared to ecosystems like Solana,
  especially given the MEV structure differences.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Convergence of Offerings:** Coinbase (crypto-first, full-stack) and Robinhood
  (equities-first, adding crypto) are rapidly overlapping in product offerings (staking,
  trading pairs, tokenization).

  *   **Robinhood’s Growth Vector:** Robinhood’s tokenized stock initiative appears
  strategically aimed at international expansion (starting in Europe) and growing
  its core brokerage business by tapping into the crypto user base that traditional
  stock exchanges cannot easily reach.

  *   **Competitive Metrics:** While Coinbase still significantly outpaces Robinhood
  in crypto-related revenue, Robinhood’s share of volume in crypto trading is reportedly
  increasing, signaling successful encroachment on Coinbase’s retail crypto dominance.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Coinbase:** Highlighted for the success of **Base** (top Ethereum L2 by TVL/DAA)
  and its full-stack crypto approach serving retail, institutions, and developers.

  *   **Robinhood:** Noted for its recent launch of **Robinhood Chain** and its acquisition
  of **Bitstamp** to bolster European liquidity.

  *   **Stripe & Revolut:** Mentioned as other large FinTech incumbents actively exploring
  or acquiring on-chain capabilities (Stripe acquiring Bridge and Privilege).

  *   **BlackRock:** Mentioned in the context of institutional adoption via Bitcoin
  ETFs, signaling the broader market shift bringing incumbents into the space.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   The discussion highlights that Robinhood’s initial rollout of tokenized stocks
  via Robinhood Chain is **Europe-only due to current US regulatory climate**. This
  suggests tokenization is being used as a regulatory workaround to enter new geographies
  faster than traditional Web2 rails allow.

  *   The difference in MEV structure between EVM chains (where Coinbase internalizes
  MEV) and Solana is noted as a factor that makes EVM L2s a "more controlled sandbox"
  suitable for highly regulated entities.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The convergence suggests that the next phase of crypto adoption will be driven by
  incumbents using on-chain rails to offer novel financial services:

  1.  **New Services:** Enabling complex activities like collateralizing tokenized
  stocks for USDC loans or borrowing crypto against tokenized equities.

  2.  **Asset Activation:** Making previously idle assets (like held crypto) more
  active through on-chain lending and borrowing protocols.

  3.  **User Acquisition:** Both firms see on-chain infrastructure as the key to accessing
  user bases they previously could not reach (DeFi users for Coinbase; international/crypto-native
  users for Robinhood).


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto Investors, FinTech Strategists, Blockchain
  Developers, and Venture Capitalists** tracking the intersection of TradFi and Web3
  infrastructure.'
