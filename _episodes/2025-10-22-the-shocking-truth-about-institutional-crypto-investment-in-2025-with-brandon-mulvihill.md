    space very, very quickly.
  topic: regulation/adoption
- impact_reason: Identifies a key structural deficiency in crypto trading (over-reliance
    on CLOBs) and introduces the ECN model (common in FX) as a disruptive solution
    for institutional adoption.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We felt like when you looked at the cryptocurrency market, there were two
    things that were missing. We thought we could solve. The first is... we knew from
    FX that the ECN execution model would be very disruptive, and we wanted to be
    the first player to launch an ECN, which we did.
  topic: technology/investment
- impact_reason: Describes the necessary evolution from integrated crypto brokers
    to a mature 'best-of-breed' structure with clear separation of duties (custody,
    market making, brokerage), mirroring TradFi maturation.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The second thing is in all markets, but notably in the FX market, as the industry
    matures, you normally start to branch away institutionally from this what crypto
    calls a vertically integrated model, what I would just call as a brokerage model.
    And you start to get to a place where you have a best-of-breed model, where you
    have separation of duties...
  topic: business/strategy
- impact_reason: Provides specific volume metrics for centralized crypto exchanges
    ($0.5T - $3.5T/month) and suggests this ceiling indicates a structural limitation
    preventing further growth.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you look at volumes in these markets, they massively outweigh what we see
    in cryptocurrency trade. Oh, for sure. And the stat I always like to say is, in
    centralized exchange volume, the market trades between 500 billion and 3.5 trillion
    per month. But the key is the 3.5 trillion. What we're not seeing in cryptocurrency
    is the market is not breaking out of that.
  topic: investment/adoption
- impact_reason: This is a strong indictment of current crypto exchange business models,
    suggesting structural issues (lack of competition/captive models) are the primary
    bottleneck to volume growth, not lack of demand or institutional presence.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The number one reason [crypto volume hasn't broken out of $3.5T/month] is
    the business models don't allow for it. And so this captive model is effectively
    not bringing forth competition, which means fees are artificially kept high.
  topic: adoption/business
- impact_reason: Provides a stark, quantitative comparison of execution costs between
    TradFi (FX) and crypto, demonstrating the massive inefficiency and high cost burden
    in the current crypto ecosystem.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: In the FX market, the cost, the total cost... you're probably paying between
    $2.00 to $5.00 a million. In cryptocurrency, you're paying hundreds of dollars
    a million. In there are some exchanges where you're paying about a thousand plus.
  topic: investment/defi

    settlement for high-frequency trading due to inherent latency issues.
  relevance_score: 10

  text: To achieve the speed that you are able to offer, are you using blockchain
    technology in any way on the platform? No, just the opposite, because blockchain
    technology is really, really slow.
  topic: technology/scalability
- impact_reason: 'Pinpoints the two fundamental, critical flaws of current on-chain
    DeFi execution: speed and cost, especially for high-volume users.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What we do get is, if you look at some of the DeFi protocols, you know, the
    two diseases they suffer from is the speed of execution is horrendously slow,
    and the cost is high because every, if you're putting a trade on the blockchain
    every single time...
  topic: defi/scalability
- impact_reason: This is a sophisticated critique of the 'real-time settlement' obsession,
    arguing that forcing immediate settlement creates artificial liquidity constraints
    and credit management overhead for sophisticated market makers.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Real-time settlement presents real market inefficiencies that people are not
    thinking of... The shorter you collapse that window and you compress their settlement
    time, they might have a position intra-hour. And if you say, we're going to settle
    now every hour, now what has to happen is they have to skew to get back their
    credit. So you're creating a synthetic problem that doesn't need to exist in terms
    of liquidity and market efficiency.
  topic: regulation/risk
- impact_reason: Draws a critical distinction between product wrappers (like ETFs)
    and fundamental changes to how trading and settlement occur (market structure),
    suggesting market structure changes are the real needle-movers for massive growth.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And those are market structure moves. So when I think about the ETF, that
    was super important, but it's not a change in market structure.
  topic: Strategy
- impact_reason: Identifies direct custody by established, trusted financial institutions
    (like BNY Mellon, State Street) as the single biggest gating issue for large-scale
    institutional adoption, surpassing even regulation in immediate importance.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But what's more important for this industry is getting TradFi custodians into
    the space in a meaningful way.
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: A strong counter-narrative to the common belief that regulation is
    the primary hurdle; emphasizes counterparty trust and familiarity as the key barrier.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The biggest gating issue for a large-scale institution coming in is not necessarily
    regulation. They want to custody their coin at a name that's familiar to them
    where they custody dollars or other assets.

    dramatically improved settlement speed, reducing counterparty and systemic risk.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What doesn't happen is that the settlement times are not, I would argue, as
    efficient as what crypto has created. And so simply the efficiency that tokenization
    kind of addresses, and I think namely the ability to settle in, it doesn't have
    to be real-time, but closer to real-time, removes a lot of friction.

    driven by choice leads directly to lower execution costs and cost of capital.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: You have this real freedom of choice, and this freedom of choice, what it
    does, is it promotes competition, and in the end, it collapses fees. Right? And
    so it collapses the cost to capital, and it collapses the cost to execute.

    mature financial markets, signaling what crypto needs to fully integrate with
    TradFi.

  text: There's no such thing as maker or taker by no, there's just customers, right?
    And so the problem for a maker is they never know if the next trade is a retail

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: The Shocking Truth About Institutional Crypto
  Investment in 2025 with Brandon Mulvihill


  This 45-minute episode features host Tony Edward interviewing **Brandon Mulvihill**,
  Co-founder and CEO of **Digital Asset Trading Technology (Crossover Markets)**.
  The core discussion revolves around the critical need to import mature **TradFi
  market structure**—specifically lessons learned from the FX market—into the nascent
  cryptocurrency ecosystem to unlock massive institutional volume growth, projecting
  a move from the current $3.5 trillion monthly ceiling toward $35 trillion.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Institutional Crypto Market Structure and Execution Technology**,
  drawing direct analogies between the Foreign Exchange (FX) market and digital assets.
  Key themes include the limitations of current crypto execution models (Central Limit
  Order Books or CLOBs), the necessity of separation of duties (custody, market making,
  brokerage), and the massive friction caused by high execution costs compared to
  FX.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **ECN Model Superiority:** Crossover Markets is pioneering the **Electronic
  Communication Network (ECN)** execution model in crypto, contrasting it with the
  dominant CLOB model. ECNs provide takers of liquidity with their own dedicated market
  data sessions, preventing adverse selection and leading to tighter spreads and better
  pricing for retail brokers.

  *   **Microsecond Execution Speed:** Crossover Markets achieves execution speeds
  of **6 to 7 microseconds**, positioning them as orders of magnitude faster than
  any other crypto venue. This speed is attributed to the expertise of their CTO,
  Vlad Ryzen (who previously built the fast FX venue FastMatch), and is achieved by
  **avoiding on-chain settlement** for execution due to blockchain''s inherent latency
  (hundreds of milliseconds).

  *   **Off-Chain Execution for DeFi:** The team is receiving inbound interest from
  DeFi protocols seeking to leverage Crossover''s technology to execute trades **off-chain**
  rapidly, posting only the final result back on-chain for transparency, thereby addressing
  the speed and cost issues plaguing current DeFi execution.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Volume Ceiling and Fee Compression:** Current centralized exchange volume
  is capped around $3.5 trillion monthly because the **vertically integrated/brokerage
  business models artificially keep fees high** (hundreds of dollars per million vs.
  $2-$5 per million in FX). Unlocking true institutional volume requires fee compression
  driven by competition.

  *   **M&A Catalyst:** Mulvihill predicts that once regulatory clarity (like the
  passage of a specific bill, possibly referencing the **Genius Act** for stablecoins)
  is achieved, **M&A activity will skyrocket** as traditional Wall Street players
  buy their way into the digital asset space.

  *   **Credit Over Real-Time Settlement:** The industry is "over its skis" focusing
  solely on real-time settlement. The more critical gating item for institutional
  adoption is **market structure around credit and netting**. Forcing immediate settlement
  creates synthetic liquidity and market efficiency problems for sophisticated market
  makers who rely on netting positions over longer time horizons.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Brandon Mulvihill:** CEO of Crossover Markets, bringing nearly 20 years of
  experience from building institutional FX businesses at **FXCM** (FXCM Pro) and
  building a prime brokerage from scratch at **Jefferies**.

  *   **Vlad Ryzen:** Crossover Markets CTO, whose prior success includes building
  the high-speed FX venue **FastMatch** (sold to Euronext) and developing the trading
  framework (AES) used for Credit Suisse’s dark pool, **Crossfinder**.

  *   **Gemini, Celsius, 3AC, FTX:** Mentioned in the context of the severe market
  turbulence (crypto winter) Crossover Markets navigated while building its institutional
  platform.

  *   **Propi:** A sponsor mentioned for leading the charge in putting **real estate
  on-chain**, using Coinbase for crypto escrow.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The passage of the **Genius Act** in the US, aimed at standardizing dollar-backed
  stablecoins, is seen as a positive step that will make FX markets more efficient
  by improving settlement capabilities, though the broader market structure evolution
  is deemed more critical.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a **best-of-breed model** characterized by a clear

  Architects** interested in the technological and structural hurdles preventing mainstream
  institutional adoption of digital assets.'
