summary: '## Podcast Summary: The Internet Capital Markets Roadmap | Lucas Bruder,
  Max Resnick & Austin Federa


  This 62-minute episode features a deep dive with key figures from the Solana ecosystem—Max
  Resnick (Anza), Lucas Bruder (Gido), and Austin Federa (00)—discussing the ambitious
  **Solana Internet Capital Markets (ICM) Roadmap**. The central theme is evolving
  Solana into a platform capable of hosting the world''s most liquid, accessible,
  and high-performance financial markets, mirroring or exceeding traditional finance
  (TradFi) capabilities.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **Solana Internet Capital Markets (ICM) Roadmap**,
  focusing heavily on **market microstructure**, **transaction sequencing/ordering**,
  and the necessary **infrastructure upgrades** (networking and execution control)
  required to support sophisticated financial applications on-chain.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Application Control Execution (ACE):** A core feature being developed, allowing
  applications fine-grained, millisecond-level control over how their orders are sequenced
  within a block, moving from probabilistic ordering to deterministic execution.

  *   **Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM):** Gido''s mechanism designed to enable ACE
  in a permissionless manner, allowing applications to deploy and gain execution control
  without forking the validator plane.

  *   **Deterministic Networking:** Double Zero (00) is building a decentralized physical
  network of fiber cables to provide dedicated, low-latency, and low-jitter routing
  between validators, crucial for achieving predictable performance required by high-frequency
  trading models.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Goal of ICM:** To build the most liquid markets on-chain, accessible globally
  with the tightest spreads possible, enabling complex financial products like on-chain
  IPOs (e.g., Figma).

  *   **Competition & Differentiation:** While current on-chain spreads can be tight
  (1-2 bps) due to proprietary AMMs leveraging current auction mechanics, the long-term
  sustainability of these tight spreads is questioned. The ICM roadmap is Solana''s
  strategy to build a superior execution environment compared to competitors like
  Ethereum L2s and centralized off-chain venues.

  *   **Hyperliquid as a Benchmark:** Hyperliquid is seen not just as a competitor
  to Solana, but to all execution layers, demonstrating significant product-market
  fit by successfully bridging off-chain execution concepts onto a fast environment.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Anza (Max Resnick):** Solana''s developer shop, driving the overall roadmap
  and transaction landing improvements.

  *   **Gido Labs (Lucas Bruder):** Developing the Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM)
  and implementing initial forms of ACE.

  *   **00 (Austin Federa):** Building Double Zero, a decentralized physical network
  infrastructure layer to solve networking latency and jitter.

  *   **Katana:** Mentioned as a DeFi-first chain focused on deep liquidity and real
  yield, sponsored by Polygon and GSR.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion implicitly touches on regulatory concepts by contrasting the current
  crypto model (where the validator is the "dictator" with complete control over block
  contents) with TradFi exchanges (which use **permissioned code** to enforce rules,
  such as prioritizing cancel orders over taker orders to maintain market health).
  The move toward ACE and BAM suggests a shift towards enforcing application-defined
  rules on-chain, a significant cultural departure for crypto.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The roadmap signals a long-term commitment to solving market microstructure challenges,
  suggesting Solana aims to become the dominant execution layer for sophisticated,
  high-throughput financial applications. The integration of physical infrastructure
  (Double Zero) with execution control (ACE/BAM) indicates a comprehensive approach
  to achieving TradFi-level performance metrics, including shrinking block times further.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Web3 infrastructure developers, DeFi strategists,
  blockchain architects, and institutional investors** focused on the technical evolution
  and competitive landscape of high-performance Layer 1 ecosystems.'
