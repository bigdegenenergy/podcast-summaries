summary: '## Summary of 20VC Episode with Imad (Founder/CEO of Mercury)


  This episode of 20VC features host Harry Stemings interviewing Imad, the founder
  and CEO of Mercury, who is also a prolific angel investor (350+ investments) and
  former YC partner. The core of the discussion revolves around Imad’s recent launch
  of his first institutional angel fund ($26M with partner Yash Toshi), his extensive
  experience as an angel investor, and his contrarian views on startup valuation and
  founder profiles.


  ### Key Takeaways for Technology Professionals:


  **1. Investor Mindset & Founder Dynamics:**

  * **Ego Removal is Crucial:** Active investors must suppress their own ideas and
  truly listen to the founder''s vision. Imad learned this lesson early when his best
  investments (like Rappi) barely spoke to him because they were too busy executing
  their own plan.

  * **The "Pushback" Paradox:** While young founders can be intimidated, a complete
  lack of pushback on an investor''s suggestions can be a red flag. However, investors
  must temper expectations based on the founder''s experience level; young founders
  often need more grace.

  * **The Best Founders Don''t Need You:** The most successful founders operate independently.
  The value of a VC, therefore, shifts from dictating strategy to providing timely,
  high-leverage support (e.g., hiring advice, market context) when the founder *chooses*
  to ask.


  **2. The Value of Venture Capital Firms:**

  * **Partner Quality Over Platform Services:** The most valuable aspect of a VC firm
  is the quality and chemistry of the specific partner you work with (e.g., Imad values
  his consistent, insightful conversations with Elad Gil).

  * **Network Effects:** The founder network provided by top-tier firms like a16z
  and Sequoia is an undervalued asset, facilitating valuable peer-to-peer connections.

  * **Sequoia Diligence:** Top firms like Sequoia perform exhaustive diligence, which
  Imad respects, viewing it as a sign that the firm is making a serious, long-term
  commitment, not just chasing a quick deal.


  **3. Valuation and Fundraising Strategy (Contrarian View):**

  * **Chase the Money (If You Can Handle It):** Imad holds a contrarian view, stating
  it is hard *not* to chase the highest valuation. He defended his Series B at a "not
  rational" 120x multiple in 2021, arguing the key mistake is **not raising enough
  money** when you secure a high valuation.

  * **The "Raise Enough to Grow Into It" Strategy:** The goal of a massive round is
  to raise enough capital so that, even if growth stalls, you have runway, or if you
  grow aggressively, you can spend into that valuation over time. This requires immense
  discipline not to spend the excess capital.


  **4. Angel Investing Lessons & Portfolio Strategy:**

  * **Serial Founders are Preferred:** Imad has a strong bias toward serial founders,
  especially those with a "chip on their shoulder" who have something left to prove,
  rather than those who have already achieved a massive exit and could retire comfortably.

  * **Naivety vs. Experience:** Imad prefers founders with outside perspective (naivety
  in the specific market, like his own start with Mercury in FinTech) over seasoned
  pros, as deep industry expertise can sometimes blind investors to novel solutions.
  He missed out on Scale AI because he judged the young founders too harshly.

  * **Angel Investing Requires Scale:** To succeed in angel investing, one must treat
  it as "unicorn hunting" (or "decacorn hunting" now) and make **20-30 bets** minimum
  to achieve the necessary diversification and portfolio effect for outsized returns.

  * **Timing the Exit:** The success of his best angel investment, Credit Karma, highlighted
  the importance of founder timing (selling near the market peak in late 2021).


  ### Context and Significance:


  This conversation is highly relevant as it provides a seasoned entrepreneur’s perspective
  on navigating capital markets across different cycles (the 2021 boom vs. current
  environment). Imad’s defense of chasing high valuations, provided the capital is
  managed responsibly, offers a counterpoint to conventional wisdom often preached
  by investors who didn''t experience that era firsthand. Furthermore, his insights
  into the psychology of successful founders and the practical realities of angel
  investing offer actionable guidance for both founders raising capital and emerging
  investors.


  ### Mentioned Entities & Frameworks:


  * **Companies:** Mercury, Rappi, Rippling, AirTable, Credit Karma, Scale AI.

  * **Investors/Partners:** Harry Stemings (Host), Imad (Guest), Yash Toshi (Imad’s
  new fund partner), Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Keith Rabois, Elad Gil (a16z
  partner).

  * **Frameworks:** The concept of "value-add" from VCs, the necessity of portfolio
  diversification in angel investing, and the debate over chasing high valuations.'
