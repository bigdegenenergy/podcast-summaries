summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: S11 E20: Alex Galkin, Competera AI


  This episode features Alex Galkin, CEO and founder of Competera AI, discussing the
  journey of building his company focused on leveraging contextual AI for dynamic
  price optimization, contrasting early skepticism with current market necessity.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **AI-driven Price Optimization** within retail and service
  industries (like cruise lines). The discussion heavily covers the challenges of
  building a data-intensive AI startup, product roadmap strategy, bootstrapping, securing
  initial customers, and the critical importance of the founding team and company
  culture.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Contextual Machine Learning for Pricing:** Competera AI utilizes a deep machine
  learning algorithm they term "contextual machine learning." This system incorporates
  significant context about how customers interact with products in specific store
  locations and aligns recommendations with stated business goals, moving beyond simple
  historical price elasticity tracking.

  *   **Legacy System Inefficiency:** The traditional method of price optimization
  involved large teams (e.g., 50-60 people) spending days or weeks running complex
  Excel models to track price elasticity. The AI solution reduces this analysis time
  to mere minutes.

  *   **Initial MVP as a Spreadsheet:** The very first iteration of Competera AI was
  essentially a Google Spreadsheet where optimization advice was delivered directly
  to the client, demonstrating an early focus on delivering immediate value even before
  building a polished software interface.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Value Proposition:** The AI offers significant ROI, positioning itself as
  a low-cost solution (e.g., $100/month) that can generate substantial returns (e.g.,
  $10,000 back) by optimizing pricing on a location-by-location basis.

  *   **Bootstrapping and Funding Realities:** Galkin details a difficult period of
  bootstrapping for years, highlighting that while the technology was sound (even
  winning awards in 2018), market adoption for AI pricing was slow until recently.
  He emphasizes that marketplace success often requires intensive funding, contrasting
  with his initial bootstrap approach.

  *   **Customer Prioritization Philosophy:** Galkin advocates for a "healthy backlog"
  prioritizing: 1) Delighting existing paying customers, 2) Addressing top requests
  from future prospects, and 3) Paying down technical debt. He stresses that feedback
  from paying customers is the most serious and actionable.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Alex Galkin (CEO, Competera AI):** The visionary who pitched AI pricing internally
  as early as 2014 (the same year OpenAI was founded) but was initially rejected by
  his former employer due to the subscription model conflict with their hourly billing
  structure.

  *   **Cruise Liners:** Mentioned as a key customer segment where the AI optimizes
  pricing based on the ship''s destination location.

  *   **Steve Blank:** Galkin mentions meeting him and strongly recommends reading
  his foundational works on customer development, despite having initially built his
  first version without following those principles.

  *   **Basecamp Founders:** Galkin expresses admiration for their bootstrapping philosophy
  and notes that Competera uses elements inspired by their "Shape Up" methodology.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a strong industry shift toward **AI taking over complex,
  data-intensive analytical roles** that were previously the domain of highly paid
  consultants or large analyst teams. Galkin’s experience shows that while the technology
  might be ahead of its time initially, the current environment is ripe for AI tools
  that provide clear, quantifiable ROI in core business functions like pricing.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **SaaS Founders, CTOs, Product Managers, and
  AI/ML Practitioners** interested in the practical, non-linear journey of bringing
  deep-tech solutions to market, particularly those focused on B2B enterprise software
  and pricing strategy.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast episode chronicles the entrepreneurial journey of Alex Galkin, founder
  of Competera AI, focusing on the development and market penetration of AI-driven
  price optimization software. Galkin recounts his early career, including dropping
  out of university to build a local ISP in Ukraine, before transitioning into consulting
  and subsequently championing the idea of subscription-based AI pricing in 2014—an
  idea that was initially dismissed by his employer who preferred hourly consulting
  models.


  The core of Competera AI lies in its **contextual machine learning** approach, which
  analyzes numerous store-specific factors to recommend optimal pricing daily or weekly,
  replacing inefficient, manual processes involving large teams and complex Excel
  sheets. Galkin highlights the dramatic efficiency gains, citing the reduction of
  analysis time from days to minutes for clients like cruise liners.


  Galkin candidly discusses the arduous path to product-market fit. He spent a year
  and a half building a large-scale software solution based on an **outsourcing model**,
  funding it himself, only to realize the critical importance of **market traction
  and funding** over pure technological complexity. This led to a painful pivot where
  he convinced his former Big Four employer to adopt his AI pricing solution. He details
  the high-stakes initial deployment: promising to optimize 30,000 products in 90
  days but only having the infrastructure ready for 300. He successfully navigated
  this near-disaster through quick thinking and leveraging the client''s commitment
  to the *concept* rather than the initial scale.


  Regarding product development and team building, Galkin stresses the difficulty
  of managing a roadmap without established roles, advocating for a **customer-centric
  backlog** that prioritizes paying users. He also touches upon the necessity of addressing
  **technical debt** proactively. On team building, he emphasizes that founding members
  must be driven by the'
