    a little bit like what Bitcoin should itself be, right? Because SDR is meant to

  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: 'This is the core speculative thesis: mapping the Bank of England''s
    history onto Bitcoin, suggesting a future where Bitcoin becomes so integral to
    sovereign debt that it effectively becomes nationalized or managed by a ''Central
    Bank of Bitcoin.'''

    the US government actually acquired a bunch of Bitcoin, but eventually needs to
    borrow more than it can and needs to start pledging Bitcoin somewhere to borrow
    that money. And then the debt actually then becomes kind of larger than anything
    that it can be paid back for. And then it becomes kind of like nationalized in
    the construct of like the role of that asset.

    That Bitcoin is digital gold and therefore it's perfect in every shape or form

    very special.
  topic: Strategy/Adoption
- impact_reason: Provides a specific historical threshold (250% Debt/GDP) tied to
    the nationalization of a major central bank, offering a potential (though not

    be a part of the national apparatus for social security.
  topic: Strategy/Macro
- impact_reason: This draws a historical parallel for how a private asset (like gold)
    can become integrated into the national financial apparatus, setting a potential
    long-term arc for Bitcoin's adoption by central banks/governments.

    banks were willing to do business with. And eventually the government then wants
    to do business with that private bank and take advantage of their reserve assets.
    And then it becomes nationalized.

    (counterparty arrangements) where sovereign nations might prefer Bitcoin's perceived
    sovereignty over traditional assets like gold or SDRs.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why Isn’t Bitcoin Pumping While Gold Soars?
  | Jeff Park


  This 41-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast, featuring Jeff Park, CIO at ProCat BTC,
  centered on a **macroeconomic world tour** to understand why Bitcoin is currently
  lagging gold despite favorable conditions (rate cuts, high liquidity, institutional
  adoption). The core narrative explored the mechanics of global finance, central
  bank interventions, and the potential future role of Bitcoin relative to traditional
  reserve assets like gold and the IMF''s Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion focused heavily on **Macroeconomics and Digital Assets**, specifically
  analyzing global financial plumbing (swap lines, reserve assets), the implications
  of US dollar hegemony, geopolitical trade wars (US/China), and the comparative performance
  and future utility of **Gold vs. Bitcoin** as stores of value and collateral.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **SDRs as Precursor to Bitcoin:** Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a basket of
  major currencies created by the IMF, function as a neutral, pledged collateral mechanism
  for central banks. This system is analogous to what Bitcoin could become—a neutral,
  non-sovereign reserve asset used for international liquidity backstops.

  *   **The Mechanics of Swap Lines:** Swap lines are the "plumbing" of the dollarized
  economy, allowing central banks to exchange currencies to provide dollar liquidity
  during systemic fractures. The US Treasury uses its Exchange Stabilization Facility
  (ESF), which holds dollars, foreign currencies, and primarily SDRs, to execute these
  interventions.

  *   **Bitcoin as Pristine Collateral:** Unlike gold, which is primarily a store
  of value, Bitcoin could evolve into a true liquid currency at the nation-state level,
  usable as pristine collateral that can be pledged, lent, and borrowed, moving beyond
  just a store-of-value narrative.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Gold''s Current Dominance:** Gold is currently sucking up market attention
  because it offers immediate psychological certainty and security amidst global chaos
  (Argentina, China, Ukraine), driven by central bank flows and retail investor fear.

  *   **Liquidity Fuels Risk Assets:** General trends of increased credit creation
  and liquidity injections by central banks (e.g., China reopening liquidity taps)
  remain fundamentally positive for risk assets, including Bitcoin, even if the immediate
  price action is muted.

  *   **The Central Bank Catalyst:** Park argues that for Bitcoin to achieve massive
  further adoption as a reserve asset, **central bank involvement** (acquiring and
  utilizing Bitcoin) is the most important force, mirroring how central banks eventually
  nationalized the Bank of England after relying on its gold reserves.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jeff Park (ProCat BTC):** Guest and CIO, providing the macro analysis and
  crypto perspective.

  *   **Anthony Pompliano (Pomp):** Host, framing the discussion around Bitcoin''s
  lagging price action relative to gold.

  *   **Javier Milei (Argentina):** Mentioned as the reformer whose initial painful
  devaluation policies have not yet delivered a convincing pro-growth story, leading
  to renewed populist pressure.

  *   **Bank of England:** Used as a historical case study showing how a private entity
  backed by gold eventually became nationalized due to overwhelming government debt
  burdens.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Argentina Intervention:** The US Treasury’s intervention in Argentina (buying
  pesos via the ESF, potentially using SDRs) highlights the geopolitical weaponization
  of dollar hegemony and the mechanics of global financial backstops.

  *   **Trade War as Capital War:** The US-China trade conflict is evolving beyond
  tariffs into a capital war, where countries negotiate capital account terms (like
  swap lines for investment guarantees), threatening the US privilege of being the
  primary source of financial asset returns.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that the current global financial instability is forcing
  a reckoning with the limitations of the post-Bretton Woods system (the dollar/SDR
  model). Bitcoin is positioned as the potential next-generation neutral reserve asset
  capable of providing the transactional utility and collateral backing that the SDR
  currently lacks, especially as sovereign debt levels rise globally.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto/Web3 Professionals, Institutional Investors,
  and Macro Strategists** who need to connect geopolitical events and central bank
  actions directly to the long-term investment thesis for Bitcoin.'
