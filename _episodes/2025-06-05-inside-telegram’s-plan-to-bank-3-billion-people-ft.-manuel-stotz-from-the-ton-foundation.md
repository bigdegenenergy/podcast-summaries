summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Inside Telegram’s Plan to Bank 3 Billion People
  ft. Manuel Stotz from the TON Foundation


  This 72-minute episode features Raoul Pal interviewing **Manuel Stotz**, the newly
  appointed President of the **TON Foundation**, focusing on the strategic integration
  of the TON blockchain with the massive user base of the Telegram messaging app.
  The core narrative revolves around leveraging Telegram’s billion-user network to
  achieve unprecedented financial inclusion and adoption for the TON ecosystem, solving
  the classic "no users" problem that plagues most new blockchains.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion is firmly rooted in **Crypto/Web3**, specifically focusing on **blockchain
  adoption, financial inclusion, digital network states, and the strategic intersection
  of massive social networks (Telegram) with decentralized finance (TON)**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Network State vs. Blockchain Startups:** Unlike most blockchains that start
  with a product and need to build a user base, TON starts with a billion-user network
  (Telegram) and needs to integrate the utility of the TON token and its financial
  layer.

  *   **Leapfrogging in Emerging Markets:** The adoption trajectory mirrors previous
  mobile/FinTech revolutions (like Kenya''s M-PESA), where users in developing nations
  leapfrog legacy systems directly to superior digital financial tools (stablecoins,
  BTC, TON).

  *   **Satoreka Concept:** Stotz posits that the blockchain space represents an entirely
  new "continent in cyberspace" (Satoreka), analogous to how the Americas were named,
  suggesting a foundational, geographically distinct economic realm built on absolute
  digital scarcity.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Untapped Financial Inclusion:** The primary opportunity lies in banking the
  3 billion unbanked/underbanked individuals globally who currently suffer from volatile
  local fiat currencies. Crypto offers them a superior store of value (stablecoins,
  BTC).

  *   **Frontier Market Parallel:** Stotz draws direct parallels between the complexities
  of investing in frontier markets (currency risk, market access, governance issues)
  and the challenges/opportunities inherent in building decentralized economies.

  *   **First-Mover Advantage in Global Networks:** Projects like TON, which gain
  traction in emerging markets first, may avoid direct competition from established
  US/Chinese tech giants, similar to how early FinTech winners emerged in Africa and
  Asia.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Manuel Stotz (TON Foundation President):** Former Goldman Sachs (GSIP) employee,
  founder of Kingsway Capital (focused on frontier/emerging markets investing), and
  now leading the strategic execution for TON.

  *   **Telegram:** The foundational network, boasting approximately one billion users,
  providing the massive distribution channel for TON.

  *   **Kingsway Capital:** Stotz’s firm specializing in public equities and venture
  investing in emerging/frontier markets, where he experienced currency volatility
  firsthand, leading him to crypto adoption.

  *   **Howard Marks (Oaktree Capital):** Mentioned for his advice to Stotz: choosing
  a game "stacked in your favor" (avoiding competition) is as important as being a
  good athlete.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touches on the **human rights aspect of financial access**, framing
  the lack of capital formation in poor countries (due to reliance on weak fiat) as
  a major problem. Digital assets are presented as a crucial tool for **poverty reduction
  and economic empowerment** by providing access to global, stable stores of value.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests that the next major wave of crypto adoption and
  value creation will originate from **emerging and frontier markets**, driven by
  necessity and the availability of mobile technology. The TON/Telegram integration
  is positioned as a potential blueprint for how a massive, existing social network
  can successfully onboard billions into a decentralized financial system, creating
  a "network continent."


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Investors, Web3 Strategists, Venture
  Capitalists, and Macro Analysts** interested in real-world adoption metrics, emerging
  market dynamics, and the strategic convergence of centralized social platforms with
  decentralized infrastructure.


  ---


  ### Comprehensive Summary


  Raoul Pal interviews Manuel Stotz, the new President of the TON Foundation, to explore
  the ambitious goal of banking three billion people via the integration of the **The
  Open Network (TON)** with **Telegram**. Stotz outlines his unconventional path from
  a humble German background, through value investing principles learned from Warren
  Buffett, to working at Goldman Sachs (GSIP), and finally founding **Kingsway Capital**,
  which specialized in navigating the volatility of frontier and emerging markets.


  Stotz argues that his experience in these markets—dealing with complex market access,
  currency collapse (e.g., the Nigerian Naira), and limited capital formation for
  the local populace—provided the perfect framework for understanding the crypto space.
  He views the crypto economy itself as a collection of **frontier markets**. The
  critical realization was that billions of people in these regions, armed with smartphones,
  are actively seeking refuge from failing fiat currencies by adopting stablecoins
  and major cryptocurrencies.


  The core strategic advantage of TON is its partnership with **Telegram**, which
  provides an immediate, massive user base of approximately one billion people—solving
  the "cold start" problem that cripples most new blockchains. Stotz frames this as
  the next logical step following the FinTech/mobile revolution seen in places like
  Kenya (M-PESA). He sees Telegram as a **"network state"** ready to adopt a new financial
  layer.


  Stotz emphasizes his mission-driven approach, believing that providing access to
  sound money (digital assets) is a crucial step in **poverty reduction and financial
  inclusion**. He took the leadership role at the TON Foundation pro bono, focusing
  on strategy'
