    seen something that I haven't seen since my days in Brazil. So far month to date,
    bonds are down over 5%, so yields are up significantly, stocks are down over 5%,

    have a fiscal deficit, we have a debt-to-GDP problem, and we have a trade deficit.
    So we're just spreading this around the globe and saying, fine, if we're going
    to have a trade deficit, you guys are all going to have to have fiscal deficits
    because there's no trade, it's going to slow down, and we can't have a depression.
    So we're just going to print money.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #1528 Jordi Visser | Bitcoin Is Primed To PUMP
  As The Dollar Collapses


  This 41-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast features Anthony Pompliano (Pomp) in
  conversation with Jordi Visser, focusing on a perceived systemic breakdown in global
  finance, the implications for the US Dollar as the global reserve currency, and
  Bitcoin''s potential role in the emerging decentralized order.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Macroeconomics and Financial System Collapse**, specifically
  analyzing the simultaneous decline in US stocks, bonds, and the dollar, which Visser
  argues signals the official "breaking" of the current global capital structure.
  Secondary focus areas include the fragmentation of global trade (bipolar world:
  US vs. China), the future of the global reserve currency, and the role of decentralized
  assets like Bitcoin and AI in the transition to a new system.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Basis Trade Unwinding:** The current volatility in the Treasury market is
  exacerbated by the unwinding of the basis trade (arbitrage between cash bonds and
  futures), which was enabled by post-Dodd-Frank restrictions on bank balance sheets,
  forcing hedge funds to take on this risk.

  *   **Debt Concentration in Benchmarks:** US Treasury debt has crowded out private
  sector debt, becoming the benchmark for the bond market. This concentration means
  bond funds use futures for leverage, pushing futures above fair value, which destabilizes
  the cash/futures relationship when volatility spikes.

  *   **Liquidity Crisis:** Extreme volatility combined with non-existent liquidity
  is forcing highly leveraged positions (often held by hedge funds) to liquidate via
  margin calls, creating a continuous domino effect similar to the 2008 subprime crisis.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Systemic Breakdown Indicators:** The simultaneous 5% drop in bonds, stocks,
  and the dollar in a single month is an unprecedented event outside of emerging markets,
  signaling a crisis at the "top of the global capital structure."

  *   **Bitcoin Underperformance vs. Gold:** Bitcoin is currently lagging gold because
  Wall Street still views it as a high-risk tech asset (like NASDAQ) rather than a
  true safe haven. Visser predicts Bitcoin will rally significantly *after* the government
  inevitably resorts to money printing to stabilize the collapsing fiat system.

  *   **Retail vs. Institutional Behavior:** Retail investors are exhibiting classic
  "buy the dip" behavior, capitalizing on the expectation of government intervention
  (printing), while institutions are constrained by quarterly liquidity demands and
  prime broker margin calls, preventing them from aggressively buying the downturn.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordi Visser:** The primary guest, offering a deep macro perspective based
  on his trading experience, arguing the system is fundamentally broken.

  *   **Donald Trump & Keir Starmer:** Mentioned as figures signaling the death of
  globalism and the shift toward protectionism/bipolar trade structures.

  *   **Scott Besson:** Referenced regarding the initial theory of how global trade
  breakdown would impact bond yields.

  *   **Stephen Mirin:** Mentioned for analysis detailing the negative consequences
  (e.g., trade deficits, security costs) associated with the US maintaining the reserve
  currency status.

  *   **Core & Polkadot:** Featured as sponsors, highlighting Bitcoin DeFi yield opportunities
  (Core) and scalable, decentralized blockchain infrastructure (Polkadot).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **The End of Reserve Status:** Visser strongly suggests that US government officials
  no longer *want* the burden of maintaining the global reserve currency status due
  to the associated trade deficits and security costs, even if the general populace
  still trusts the US.

  *   **Government Intervention:** The primary expected government response to disorderly
  deleveraging is not immediate rate cuts, but rather intervention in the bond market
  (e.g., halting Quantitative Tightening or creating new liquidity facilities, as
  seen with SVB). The historical precedent suggests printing will occur to avoid a
  depression.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the world is rapidly transitioning to a **decentralized
  system**, driven by the necessity of navigating the US-China trade impasse and accelerated
  by the adoption of **AI and Crypto**. This transition will be characterized by **accelerated
  volatility** (up 10%, down 10% days) until the government intervenes decisively
  to stop the deleveraging, likely through monetary expansion. The ultimate optimistic
  view is that this turbulence leads to a more decentralized, resilient structure.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Financial Professionals, Macro Investors,
  and Crypto Strategists** who need a deep, technical understanding of the interplay
  between sovereign debt markets, geopolitical shifts, and the potential inflection
  points for digital assets.'
