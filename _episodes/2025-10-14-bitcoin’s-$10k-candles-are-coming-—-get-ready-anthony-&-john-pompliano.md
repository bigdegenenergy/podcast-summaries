    Somebody one time told me, "If the price is moving, there's news." It's just whether

    *sooner* than traditional markets because they are smaller and attract specialized

  text: What's fascinating is everyone always says, "Whatever you're thinking about
    is already priced in," right? And I think with prediction markets, it actually
    gets farther out on that curve, and it's not necessarily priced in because you
    may have some information or you may be able to see something that the rest of
    the market isn't seeing because it's actually still quite a small market right
    now, right?

    how do we handle that stuff? But what I know is from an investor's seat is investors
    are going to start to put more and more weight on these prediction markets because
    it's basically an information incentive to get people to contribute to, "Are they
    going to beat this number or not?"

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Bitcoinâ€™s $10K Candles Are Coming â€” Get Ready | Anthony
  & John Pompliano


  This 50-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast, featuring Anthony Pompliano and John
  Pompliano, centered on analyzing recent market volatility in Bitcoin and the broader
  stock market, arguing against prevailing recession and bubble narratives by highlighting
  fundamental shifts in monetary policy and investor behavior.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**: Cryptocurrency Markets (Bitcoin), Macroeconomics, Stock Market
  Analysis, and Geopolitical Influence on Finance.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Bitcoin Liquidity Event**: The recent $19 billion liquidation event in Bitcoin,
  while sharp ($121k to $108k), was short-lived, suggesting it successfully "wiped
  out excess leverage," paving the way for higher prices.

  *   **24/7 Market Advantage**: Geopolitical events occurring outside traditional
  stock market hours (like the Friday-to-Sunday window) drive traders toward 24/7
  markets like crypto, as they offer immediate execution when news breaks.

  *   **Dollar vs. Percentage Moves**: The market vernacular is shifting; while percentage
  moves in Bitcoin remain relatively small, the *aggregate dollar amount* of daily
  moves (e.g., $10K to $20K candles) is increasing as the asset matures.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Pessimism is Overstated**: The consensus among respected investors (like Howard
  Marks) is that the market is **not** in a bubble, and a major crash is unlikely
  due to central bank intervention.

  *   **Bull Market Longevity**: The current bull market is only about three years
  in, significantly shorter than the historical average of seven to eight years, suggesting
  substantial runway remains.

  *   **Retail "Buy the Dip" Reflexivity**: Retail investors have learned that rapid
  dips are temporary due to expected central bank support, leading to a strategy of
  buying aggressively into volatility.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Donald Trump**: His use of social media (e.g., announcing tariffs late Friday)
  to influence market sentiment and negotiate geopolitically was highlighted as a
  demonstration of presidential "superpower."

  *   **Jamie Dimon**: Mentioned as one of the established figures now acknowledging
  the current market is a bull market.

  *   **Palantir**: Used as an example of modern corporate efficiency, where CEOs
  are prioritizing revenue growth *per employee* rather than simply hiring volume.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   **Fed Playbook**: The core argument is that the Federal Reserve will **not**
  allow a prolonged (18+ month) bear market or recession. Their playbook involves
  deploying massive monetary stimulus (QE, rate cuts) to prevent asset price collapse,
  even at the cost of significant dollar purchasing power erosion.

  *   **Asset Price Priority**: The hosts argue that policymakers prioritize maintaining
  high asset prices over avoiding inflation or currency devaluation.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  *   Bitcoin is currently in its "teenage years"â€”more mature than before, but not
  yet an "adult" asset (which they estimate will happen around a $10 trillion market
  cap).

  *   The era of government-induced stimulus means asset owners are being rewarded,
  while those reliant on traditional wage growth are suffering due to currency debasement.
  Investors should adjust their strategy to this reality.


  **7. Target Audience**: Crypto investors, macro-focused financial professionals,
  and active stock market participants looking for a contrarian view on current market
  fears.'
