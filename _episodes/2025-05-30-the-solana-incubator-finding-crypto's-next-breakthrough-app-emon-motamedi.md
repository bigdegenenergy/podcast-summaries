    teams about as well.

    fostering businesses driven by on-chain revenue, not just speculation or hype.'

    was like, hey, let's let's bring real sustainable businesses to Salana that aren't
    only reliant on a lot of eyeballs or a lot of VC funding or token go up, that
    they're actually working to drive revenues on-chain revenues, ideally profitability,

    incentive or coordination problem within the protocol.'

    some of this negative short-term thinking... and discouraged real-world use cases

    to kind of develop and might fail in the end if I know that the SEC might sue
    me out of existence halfway through it...

summary: '## Podcast Summary: The Solana Incubator: Finding Crypto''s Next Breakthrough
  App | Emon Motamedi


  This episode features an in-depth discussion with Emon Motamedi, Head of the Solana
  Incubator, focusing on his approach to fostering sustainable, real-world adoption
  startups within the Solana ecosystem, particularly following the recent **Solana
  Accelerate** conference.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **startup building and idea generation within the Solana
  ecosystem**, emphasizing the shift from low-hanging fruit applications (like basic
  DeFi primitives) toward **real-world adoption** and **sustainable business models**.
  Key themes include navigating rapid market shifts, encouraging non-derivative innovation,
  and leveraging Solana as infrastructure for broader consumer applications.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Evolving Solana Core:** The conversation noted a shift in core Solana development
  focus, referencing the update to the Agave client and the rise of Onze as a key
  client developer, suggesting a dynamic and competitive environment even at the protocol
  level (contrasting with past focus on Fire Dancer).

  *   **Mobile-Native Focus:** The Incubator is actively seeking and supporting startups
  building applications with **Solana Mobile** in mind, recognizing mobile as a crucial
  vector for mass adoption.

  *   **Viral Growth Mechanisms:** Discussion highlighted the importance of embedding
  viral growth hooks directly into the User Experience (UX) flow, referencing historical
  examples (like Hotmail footers) and recent successes like the **Believe** meme coin
  launchpad.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Increased Competition:** The Solana ecosystem is maturing, leading to intense
  competition in previously uncontested sectors (e.g., aggregators like Jupiter now
  facing new lending/aggregator rivals). This forces genuine innovation beyond basic
  protocol replication.

  *   **Sustainability Over Hype:** Motamedi stresses a principle of avoiding purely
  trend-driven projects. He advises founders to focus on **long-term vision** and
  **on-chain revenues/profitability** rather than relying solely on VC funding or
  token appreciation, noting that "the quicker something grows, the quicker something
  falls."

  *   **Infrastructure vs. Crypto-Native:** A key distinction is made between applications
  built *for* the crypto audience (often speculation-based) and those that use crypto
  merely as **infrastructure** to support broader, non-crypto-native use cases. The
  latter is seen as the path to sustainable, mass-market PMF.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Solana Incubator/Salana Labs:** The organization running the program, now
  focused on developing startups rather than core protocol development.

  *   **Nikita Beer:** Advisor to Solana Foundation/Labs, brought in to mentor Cohort
  2 teams. He is cited for pushing founders to think about **10x or 1000x growth**
  rather than incremental feature additions (i.e., taking "big swings").

  *   **Believe:** A recent viral meme coin launchpad (formerly Cloud) highlighted
  as a successful example of engineering viral growth mechanisms into the product.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   The recent **Solana Accelerate** conference included a significant policy track,
  signaling a strategic push by Solana within the US, supported by the launch of the
  **Solana Policy Institute** in the DC area, indicating a focus on regulatory maturity.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a phase where the "low-hanging fruit" is gone, demanding
  deeper innovation. The future success on Solana will likely come from teams that
  successfully abstract the complexity of crypto infrastructure to deliver compelling
  **consumer experiences** (potentially mobile-first) that solve real-world problems,
  rather than just creating new speculative vehicles.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Web3 founders, venture capitalists, ecosystem
  builders, and product managers** operating within or investing in the Solana ecosystem,
  especially those seeking strategies for long-term product-market fit beyond immediate
  speculative narratives.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast centers on Emon Motamedi’s philosophy guiding the Solana Incubator,
  particularly as the ecosystem matures past its initial building phase. Motamedi
  discusses the atmosphere following the **Solana Accelerate** conference, noting
  a palpable shift in conventional wisdom and increased competition across all sectors.


  A major theme is the **necessity of sustainable innovation**. Motamedi argues against
  chasing short-lived, trend-based narratives (like recent AI agent launches) because
  the incentive structure in crypto often rewards quick capital gains over long-term
  viability. His core principle for incubator teams is to build businesses capable
  of sustaining themselves through **on-chain revenues** rather than relying on token
  pumps or continuous VC injections.


  Motamedi shares a detailed framework for **startup idea generation**, adapted from
  Roger Dickies. This involves two paths: the traditional "build what you need" approach,
  and a more structured **"graph/vector" method**. This latter technique involves
  mapping technological trends (e.g., AI, VR, Solana developments) against various
  industries (e.g., travel, dating) to systematically brainstorm novel intersections,
  forcing founders beyond obvious applications.


  Furthermore, the discussion emphasizes the strategic importance of **consumer adoption
  and mobile**. The Incubator is explicitly prioritizing mobile-native builders and
  leveraged the expertise of consumer product veteran Nikita Beer, who encourages
  founders to adopt a **10x mindset** rather than incremental improvements. The ultimate
  goal of the Incubator is to seed Solana with robust, sustainable businesses that
  utilize crypto as powerful, often invisible, infrastructure to achieve broad, real-world
  adoption, moving beyond the current reliance on speculation and stablecoins for
  PMF.'
