  text: The guidance they gave at the time is that if you're building something that's
    non-custodial where the builders of the protocol don't have direct control over

    we're going to sell equity to the public by literally dumping shares on the exchange.
    It would be like if a crypto company had its tokens and we're literally just like
    doing market orders on you this one.
  topic: Technology/DeFi

    invent shares. You make new shares all the time.
  topic: Technology/Regulation
- impact_reason: This points to a fundamental failure in public market transparency,

summary: '## Podcast Summary: The Chopping Block: Tornado Cash on Trial, Crypto Privacy
  in Crisis, and Robert’s LQR House Takeover - Ep. 880


  This episode of The Chopping Block centers almost entirely on the high-stakes criminal
  trial of Roman Storm, co-creator of the privacy protocol Tornado Cash, and the broader
  implications for software development, privacy rights, and regulatory overreach
  in the crypto industry. The discussion is deeply personal for the hosts, as Dragonfly
  (the firm of two hosts) was the seed investor in Tornado Cash.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Crypto Regulation and Privacy Rights**, specifically analyzing
  the **Tornado Cash criminal trial** (Roman Storm) regarding charges of conspiracy
  to launder money and unlicensed money transmission. Secondary themes include the
  nature of **decentralized, immutable software**, the role of **venture capital in
  regulated spaces**, and the **DOJ''s conduct** during the proceedings.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Immutability as Defense:** The defense hinges on the fact that Tornado Cash
  smart contracts are immutable and non-custodial. The argument is that once deployed,
  the code operates autonomously, meaning the original developers (like Storm) do
  not control the funds or the ongoing transactions, similar to how Apple cannot access
  iMessage content.

  *   **The Nature of Privacy Tools:** The prosecution’s argument that Tornado Cash
  should function like a centralized exchange (Coinbase) by implementing KYC/AML was
  heavily criticized. Experts like Matthew Green countered that this fundamentally
  misunderstands the purpose of privacy-preserving technology, which is to offer censorship-resistant
  financial privacy akin to tools like Signal or WhatsApp.

  *   **Tornado Cash Baked into Ethereum:** A notable point is that the Beacon Chain
  staking contract was deployed using an address funded by Tornado Cash, suggesting
  the protocol is now intrinsically linked to the fabric of Ethereum, regardless of
  the trial''s outcome.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Chilling Effect on Innovation:** The prosecution of a developer for building
  an immutable protocol sets a dangerous precedent, potentially stifling future entrepreneurs
  from building privacy-preserving tools due to fear of criminal liability.

  *   **Investor Liability Precedent:** The DOJ’s brief contemplation of bringing
  **criminal charges against Dragonfly** (an early-stage investor) for simply investing
  in a protocol accused of wrongdoing is unprecedented and alarming for the VC community,
  suggesting a massive expansion of liability beyond established norms (e.g., Theranos,
  FTX).

  *   **Privacy as a Core Crypto Principle:** The discussion reinforces that financial
  privacy is crucial for censorship-resistant wealth, a foundational tenet of crypto
  that is now under direct legal threat.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Roman Storm:** Co-creator of Tornado Cash, currently on trial facing serious
  criminal charges. He is viewed by the community as a champion for developer rights
  and privacy.

  *   **Dragonfly (and Hosts):** The firm was the seed investor in Tornado Cash. They
  were briefly and publicly threatened with criminal charges by the DOJ during the
  trial, leading to a weekend firestorm before the DOJ retracted the statement.

  *   **OFAC (Office of Foreign Assets Control):** Mentioned for their unprecedented
  2022 sanctions against the Tornado Cash smart contracts themselves, which were later
  overturned by the Fifth Circuit as unconstitutional overreach.

  *   **Coin Center, EFF, Paradigm:** Groups that have provided support and filed
  Amicus Briefs on behalf of Roman Storm.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Adjudication via Criminal Case:** A central argument is that criminal prosecution
  is the wrong venue to adjudicate broad policy questions (i.e., whether national
  security outweighs individual privacy). If the government wants to restrict privacy
  tools, it should pass clear laws, not use criminal cases against developers of non-custodial
  software.

  *   **DOJ Misconduct:** The DOJ’s unprecedented public statement in open court suggesting
  they were contemplating charges against Dragonfly principals, only to retract it
  days later, is highlighted as a major breach of protocol and an example of the government
  weaponizing public pressure.

  *   **Blanche Memo Context:** The discussion references a past DOJ memo suggesting
  resources should not be spent prosecuting "victimless crimes" like non-compliance
  in crypto, contrasting sharply with the aggressive prosecution of the Tornado Cash
  case.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The outcome of the Roman Storm trial is predicted to be a watershed moment determining
  the future viability of **privacy-preserving software development** in the US. If
  the prosecution succeeds based on the current arguments, the industry may see a
  severe chilling effect, pushing innovation offshore or halting development entirely
  in areas requiring anonymity. The case will likely face years of appeals, regardless
  of the initial verdict.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Developers, Legal Professionals in Tech, Venture Capitalists, and Policy
  Advocates.** Professionals interested in the intersection of software engineering,
  constitutional rights, and regulatory enforcement within decentralized finance will
  find this most valuable.'
