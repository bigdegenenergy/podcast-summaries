    which affects prices) leading to contrarian buying.

  text: a big driver of that is retail saying, "Buy the dip." When it goes down, it's
    going to go back up later. Buy the dip, buy the dip, buy the dip, buy the dip.
    It's a generation that understands reflexivity better than any generation that
    came before it.
  topic: adoption

    availability makes it a superior venue for trading during unpredictable global
    events when traditional markets are shuttered.'

  text: The second thing is that Bitcoin was the only market that was open. And so
    every single time that a geopolitical event or a macro event occurs during hours
    where the stock market is closed, there are a couple more people around the world
    who say, "Wait a second, why am I trading in a market where it is closed more
    hours a week than it is open? This market over here is open 24/7. That's interesting
    to me."

    component.

    Would it be illegal? I don't think so.

    good strategy, right?

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Bitcoin’s $10K Candles Are Coming — Get Ready | Anthony
  & John Pompliano


  This 50-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast, featuring Anthony Pompliano and John
  Pompliano, centers on dissecting recent market volatility—specifically a sharp dip
  and recovery in Bitcoin—and arguing against the prevailing narrative of an imminent
  stock market crash, framing current conditions as a new era of sustained asset appreciation
  driven by central bank intervention.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion primarily focuses on **Cryptocurrency Markets (Bitcoin)**, **Traditional
  Equity Markets (Stocks/NASDAQ)**, and **Macroeconomic Policy/Geopolitics** as they
  influence asset valuations. Key themes include market reflexivity, the impact of
  presidential tweets on markets, and the changing nature of asset bubbles and bull
  markets.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin Liquidity Clearing:** The recent $19 billion liquidation event in
  Bitcoin successfully "wiped out all the excess leverage," which is viewed as a necessary
  cleansing event that clears the path for higher prices.

  *   **24/7 Market Appeal:** Geopolitical events occurring outside traditional stock
  market hours (like the recent Friday-to-Sunday news cycle) highlight Bitcoin''s
  advantage as the only continuously open, liquid market, attracting users seeking
  real-time trading capabilities.

  *   **Dollar vs. Percentage Volatility:** The vernacular around Bitcoin is shifting
  from focusing on absolute dollar movements (e.g., "$2,000 move") to percentage moves,
  even though the aggregate dollar value of daily moves is increasing as the asset
  matures.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Pessimism is Wrong:** The hosts strongly argue that predictions of an immediate
  market crash are outdated ("dinosaur" thinking) because the Federal Reserve has
  an established playbook to prevent prolonged bear markets (over 18 months) via immediate
  rate cuts and stimulus.

  *   **Retail Investor Genius:** The "Buy the Dip" mentality among retail investors
  is validated, as they understand that central banks will always prioritize asset
  price support over allowing a deep recession, making dips temporary buying opportunities.

  *   **New Valuation Paradigm:** Current high valuation multiples in tech stocks
  are justified because companies are achieving higher growth rates (e.g., 30% YoY
  for trillion-dollar companies) with greater efficiency (e.g., growing revenue with
  fewer employees, as seen with Palantir).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump:** Mentioned for his perceived use of social media and geopolitical
  announcements (like tariff threats) to manipulate market sentiment and negotiate
  leverage, often timing announcements around market open/close.

  *   **Howard Marks (Oaktree):** Cited as a respected value investor who is currently
  *not* calling for a market crash, suggesting the market is not yet in a bubble state.

  *   **Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan):** Noted for publicly stating that the current environment
  is a bull market.

  *   **Palantir:** Used as a prime example of modern corporate efficiency, demonstrating
  the ability to grow revenue significantly while simultaneously reducing headcount.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The core policy discussion revolves around the **Federal Reserve''s interventionist
  playbook**. The hosts assert that the Fed will prioritize preventing prolonged asset
  price declines (even at the cost of dollar purchasing power) over enduring a long
  recession, effectively "outlawing" multi-year bear markets through monetary bazookas
  (QE/rate cuts). This manipulation of the money supply is acknowledged as potentially
  unhealthy long-term but is the current reality driving asset prices.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests Bitcoin is currently in its **"teenage years"—more mature
  than before, but not yet an "adult" asset** (which might be defined by a $10 trillion
  market cap, institutional balance sheet adoption, and central bank acceptance).
  The industry is heading toward 24/7 global markets, driven partly by the desire
  to trade during macro events that occur outside traditional trading hours.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto Investors, Active Traders, and Financial
  Professionals** interested in the intersection of macroeconomics, monetary policy,
  and digital asset valuation. It provides a contrarian view against mainstream recession
  fears.'
