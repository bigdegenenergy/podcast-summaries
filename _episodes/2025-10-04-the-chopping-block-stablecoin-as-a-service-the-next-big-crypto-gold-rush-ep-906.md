summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - The rise of verticalized 'stablecoin chains' like Circle's Arc and Tempo (Paradigm/Stripe)
    signals a new focus on stablecoin-native infrastructure, moving beyond general-purpose
    L1s.
  - Tempo is launching as a payments-first L1 with a permissioned validator set including
    major enterprises, claiming it will decentralize over time.
  - 'Arc differentiates itself through three core features: stablecoin-native fees
    (USDC), sub-second deterministic finality, and built-in privacy controls for institutions.'
  - Despite widespread discussion, non-USD stablecoins have historically failed to
    gain traction, with the market remaining overwhelmingly dominated by USD-denominated
    stablecoins (99%).
  - The push for FX capabilities in new chains like Arc and Tempo is framed as necessary
    for future tokenized real-world assets, even if current stablecoin adoption is
    primarily for USD savings outside the US.
  - The recent USDC bakeoff dynamics, exemplified by Hyperliquid securing a native
    USDC deal, highlight a new era where ecosystems can collectively bargain with
    stablecoin issuers for better terms.
  overview: This episode of The Chopping Block dives into the emerging trend of 'Stablecoin-as-a-Service'
    via specialized Layer 1 blockchains, focusing on the competition between Circle's
    Arc and the newly announced Tempo (backed by Paradigm and Stripe). The discussion
    explores the core features differentiating these new chains, such as native stablecoin
    fees, finality, and privacy, while also debating the persistent, yet historically
    underutilized, role of non-USD stablecoins in global finance.
  themes:
  - Stablecoin-Native Layer 1 Blockchains (Arc vs. Tempo)
  - Competitive Landscape and Institutional Adoption
  - The Role and Future of Foreign Exchange (FX) Stablecoins
