    one or two, you know, you have one non-shady market maker and then also have Web3Port,
    right? For all I know, that's what Rushi did is that they probably didn't just
    have one market maker, right? They probably had multiple, and one of them was
    basically the dumper.

  text: This market-making agreement involved this group Web3Port basically having
    an agreement that they were going to be able to liquidate their tokens that they
    received as part of the market-making agreement if the fully diluted valuation
    of Movement was above $5 billion. And all the tokens that they sold, they were
    going to split the profits 50-50 with the foundation, basically meaning that this
    market maker, quote unquote, became an agent to dump the tokens if they were able
    to push the token price up.
  topic: DeFi/Business
- impact_reason: Contrasts the specific problematic agreement with standard practice,
    highlighting the structural flaw that encouraged dumping.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This contract was very non-market in that it didn't have a call option, it
    didn't have like anything like this. Basically, it had this really weird incentive
    to push the token up because once it crosses $5 billion, basically the protocol
    ends, the market-maker would split the proceeds between each other.
  topic: DeFi/Business
- impact_reason: 'Reveals a secondary, massive incentive: the market maker was potentially
    collateralized with $60M-$100M, creating an urgent need to liquidate tokens to
    recover that capital, amplifying the dumping incentive.'

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What was really interesting for me in this particular case with Web3Port is
    that... there was also another sign which put a really clear incentive for the
    market, well, Web3Port transports them, I know, like, $60 or $100 million, some
    like insane amount of money, which, for example, in our case, we would never do
    it, because it is just an insane amount of money.
  topic: Investment/Business

    when massive capital is tied up as collateral, providing a deep economic rationale
    for the market maker's actions.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Even if a protocol gives you 5% of token supply, like as a market maker, make
    money from trading, like this $60 million, you deploy it, like, in perpetual strategies,
    or market-maker strategies, in DeFi, like whatever it is you do, like there is
    a real cost, well, there is a real cost of having this inventory on your hands,
    and basically, if you receive protocol tokens, and in return, it gives, like an
    insane amount, like, around $60 million as collateral, I guess, which is what
    it was, you have an extra incentive to basically push the price up and sell as
    many MOVE tokens as possible to basically have those dollars back, because otherwise,
    you're just, every day, you're just losing money by not deploying those dollars
    into your strategies.

    as a cover for founders to dump tokens onto the market and cash out, a major regulatory
    concern.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: many of these market-making firms in name are basically ways of illegally
    cashing out founders. And they sort of say, oh, we're quote unquote market-making,
    but really what we're doing is we're taking tokens, we're dumping them, and we're
    splitting the proceeds with you, which is exactly what Web3Port's deal was structured
    to be.
  topic: Regulation/DeFi

    disclosure of market-making agreements, drawing a parallel to traditional IPO
    requirements to enhance market fairness.'

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: my proposal was that I think one way that a lot of this can be solved, not
    not completely obviously, because there's always room for fraud. And, you know,
    if someone is defrauding people outright and they're lying about these things,
    and okay, there's not much you can do to stop that. But with these market-making
    agreements, it is, you know, in traditional markets, you disclose your market
    makers are, and you can't go public without having those disclosures.
  topic: Regulation/DeFi
- impact_reason: Sets a high bar for information parity in crypto markets, aiming
    to eliminate the information asymmetry where centralized exchanges possess critical
    data (like MM agreements) that retail lacks.

  topic: Regulation/Adoption

    voluntary, early disclosure of market structure can lead to backlash, creating
    a disincentive for transparency.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And the really bad thing about our industry currently is we actually, one,
    I had at least one protocol that did those disclosures in the past, and that was
    WorldCoin last year or a year and a half ago. Like, I don't remember, I don't
    remember it was, but like WorldCoin actually did disclose the loans, did disclose
    the market makers, did disclose the strike prices. And they got all the shit in
    the world for this because people just started criticizing them, why do you create
    this structure?
  topic: Regulation/Adoption
- impact_reason: 'Articulates the ''Tragedy of the Commons'' or prisoner''s dilemma
    in crypto transparency: voluntary disclosure is punished, leading to a Nash equilibrium
    where everyone remains silent.'

  text: So, okay, we can disclose this stuff and be like good to our, whatever, investors.
    Or we can just like keep it quiet because we don't want to get all the shit. And
    that's currently where we are as the industry as well, because not only, not only
    is there no disclosures, but also like if you disclose, you get, yeah. So if it's
    if it's voluntary, there's an equilibrium in which no one discloses in essence.
  topic: Regulation/Strategy

    structure, even if decentralized protocols exist.

  text: I think some uniformity in order to solve this problem is that all the market
    makers are disclosed. And the exchange knows, right? Because the exchange sees
    who's trading the asset. They see who's providing liquidity. So you can never
    run it by an exchange without the exchange knowing. So if you're buying it, you're
    going to be based on the primary liquidity venue for an asset. You ultimately
    are the primary enforcer.

    that only robust disclosure can provide verifiable assurance to the market that

  text: The founders, you know, the ones that we back, they don't do shit like this.
    They're not getting rich dumping their tokens on day one. Like that's insane behavior.
    So, but the only way people are going to have confidence that that's true is if
    there's a robust disclosure regime.

    agreements to include any material transaction information relevant to investor
    decision-making.

    Ev Ginny, lots of other things like basically what's disclosed again in Dragonfly,

    market makers based on the current market cycle (bulls credit MMs for pumps, bears
    blame them for dumps).

  text: It's just very like, oh, there's like kind of kind of factors. It's very cycle
    specific. So like if it's a bull market, people believe that market makers are
    pushing prices up. If it's a bear market, people believe that market makers push
    prices down.

- impact_reason: Accurately describes the momentum-driven, path-dependent nature of
    crypto pricing, contrasting it with the mean-reverting nature of traditional assets.

  text: Whereas crypto prices are kind of path-dependent and they're very momentum-driven
    and they're sort of auto-correlated. So that goes up tends to keep going up, then
    that goes down tends to keep going down. Wouldn't that make market making against
    retail harder?

summary: '## Podcast Summary: The Chopping Block: Can Crypto Clean Itself Up? Market
  Structure, Trust, and Regulation - Ep. 833


  This episode of The Chopping Block focuses heavily on the recent scandal involving
  the **Movement** project, using it as a case study to dissect opaque and potentially
  manipulative practices within the crypto market structure, particularly concerning
  **market-making agreements**.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **scandal surrounding Movement Labs/Movement Industries**,
  specifically the **market-making agreement** signed with the firm **Web3Port**.
  The discussion broadens to examine the lack of transparency, misaligned incentives,
  and the general state of trust in crypto market infrastructure, contrasting standard
  market-making practices with the alleged "shady" deal.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Standard Market-Making (MM) Structure:** Typical MM agreements involve KPIs
  (uptime, spread) and a "carrot," usually a **call option structure** allowing the
  MM to buy tokens at a fixed strike price (often 25-50% above T-VAP) at the contract''s
  end. This aligns incentives toward maintaining liquidity.

  *   **The Web3Port Anomaly:** The Movement/Web3Port deal allegedly lacked a standard
  call option. Instead, it featured a bizarre incentive: if the token''s Fully Diluted
  Valuation (FDV) crossed **$5 billion**, the MM (Web3Port) and the Movement Foundation
  would **50/50 split the profits** from tokens sold, effectively incentivizing the
  MM to act as an agent to dump tokens once a price threshold was hit.

  *   **Incentive Misalignment via Collateral:** A significant factor exacerbating
  the incentive to dump was the alleged **$60–$100 million in collateral** provided
  to Web3Port. This large cash position created a high opportunity cost, pressuring
  the MM to quickly liquidate the MOVE tokens to redeploy those dollars into more
  profitable DeFi strategies.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Lack of Transparency:** The scandal highlights how much "shit show" activity
  likely occurs beneath the surface, hidden by a lack of transparency in private agreements
  between projects and market makers.

  *   **Market Maker Identification:** Reputable, large market makers (like Wintermute)
  operate with diversified, transparent structures, whereas many smaller or unknown
  firms (often operating out of Asia) may function primarily as vehicles for founders
  to **illegally cash out** by dumping tokens under the guise of market-making.

  *   **VC Responsibility:** The discussion questions the role of Venture Capitalists
  in vetting founders and agreements, especially when high-profile, marketing-heavy
  projects with seemingly weak technical foundations raise red flags.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Movement Labs/Movement Industries:** The L1/L2 project at the center of the
  scandal.

  *   **Web3Port:** The market-making firm involved in the allegedly manipulative
  agreement.

  *   **Rushi (Co-founder/CEO of Movement Labs):** Fired following the revelations.

  *   **Ev Ginny (Wintermute):** Provided expert insight into standard market-making
  practices.

  *   **Robert Ventures:** Disclosed as a minor, uninformed investor in Movement.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  While direct regulatory action wasn''t the focus, the conversation strongly implies
  a need for **standardization and sunlight**. The panelists likened the current state
  of market-making agreements to the pre-**Y Combinator SAFE** era in venture capital—a
  period rife with custom, potentially predatory terms. The implication is that the
  industry needs a "SAFE equivalent" for market-making contracts to enforce better
  standards and reduce opportunities for malfeasance.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is likely heading toward increased scrutiny of **off-chain agreements**
  and **liquidity provision structures**. The Movement fallout may force protocols
  and VCs to demand greater adherence to standard, transparent market-making terms
  to avoid similar public relations and financial disasters. There is an expectation
  that more under-the-surface dramas will be exposed as the market becomes more attuned
  to these mechanics.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Professionals, Early-Stage Investors (VCs/Angels), DeFi Developers, and
  Market Structure Analysts.** Anyone involved in token launches, liquidity provision,
  or due diligence on new projects needs to understand the risks embedded in non-standard
  market-making deals.'
