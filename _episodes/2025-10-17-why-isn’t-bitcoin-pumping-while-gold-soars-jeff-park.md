    US government actually acquired a bunch of Bitcoin, but eventually needs to borrow
    more than it can, and needs to start pledging Bitcoin somewhere to borrow that

    it can be paid back for, and then it becomes kind of like nationalized in the

    battling and shit-talking? Like when Bitcoiners fight other Bitcoiners about the

    as competition, but as a roadmap for integration into the existing global financial
    apparatus.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We should not as Bitcoiners look at gold's rise as an adversary outcome. Actually,
    gold has had staying power because for hundreds of years it's been able to be
    a part of that modern economy apparatus. The question is how do you get Bitcoin
    into that mix?

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why Isn’t Bitcoin Pumping While Gold Soars?
  | Jeff Park


  This 41-minute episode of the POMP podcast features Anthony Pompliano (POMP) in
  conversation with Jeff Park, CIO of ProCat BTC. The core discussion revolves around
  the current macro environment, the surprising strength of gold relative to Bitcoin,
  and the evolving role of reserve assets in global finance, drawing parallels between
  historical central banking and the potential future of Bitcoin.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Macroeconomics and Digital Assets**, specifically analyzing
  the divergence between gold and Bitcoin performance despite favorable conditions
  for risk assets (expected rate cuts, high global liquidity). Key themes include
  the mechanics of the global dollarized economy, central bank intervention (swap
  lines), geopolitical trade wars (US/China), and the historical evolution of reserve
  assets.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **SDRs as a Precursor to Bitcoin:** Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a Bretton
  Woods invention based on a basket of major currencies, function as a neutral, pledged
  collateral for central banks. This mechanism is compared to the ideal role Bitcoin
  could eventually play as a neutral, transactional reserve asset, potentially replacing
  the SDR construct.

  *   **Dual Exchange Rates in Crisis:** The situation in Argentina highlights the
  reality of dual exchange rates (official vs. "blue chip" black market rate), demonstrating
  how market participants seek refuge in non-sovereign currencies (like USD or Bitcoin/stablecoins)
  when official rates fail.

  *   **Trade Wars as Capital Wars:** Geopolitical trade conflicts (like US/China)
  inevitably spill over into the capital account, forcing nations to negotiate terms
  regarding cross-border investment flows and the attractiveness of their domestic
  financial assets (e.g., US capital account surplus).


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Gold’s Psychological Dominance:** Gold is currently sucking liquidity because
  it offers immediate, proven psychological certainty and security in times of global
  chaos, driven by both institutional flows and retail fear.

  *   **Bitcoin’s Missing Catalyst:** Despite strong adoption conduits, Bitcoin is
  lagging gold because central banks have not yet formally integrated it into their
  reserve management or plumbing, which Park argues is the most crucial force for
  further store-of-value adoption.

  *   **Liquidity as a Risk Asset Driver:** Park remains bullish on risk assets generally,
  noting that continued credit creation and liquidity injections by governments (e.g.,
  China reopening state budget swap lines) provide a fiscal dominance tailwind.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jeff Park (ProCat BTC):** Guest and CIO providing the macro analysis.

  *   **Anthony Pompliano (POMP/POMP Investments):** Host driving the discussion on
  macro alignment with crypto investment theses.

  *   **The Bank of England:** Used as a historical case study to illustrate how a
  private entity, initially managing gold for the government, eventually becomes nationalized
  when sovereign debt levels become unsustainable.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **US Treasury Intervention (Argentina):** The US Treasury intervened in Argentina
  using its Exchange Stabilization Facility (ESF), which primarily holds SDRs, to
  buy pesos. This action underscores the US government’s role in maintaining the plumbing
  of the dollarized global economy, even when dealing with failing currencies.

  *   **Historical Nationalization:** The history of the Bank of England (nationalized
  in 1946 after 250 years as a private company due to debt-to-GDP ratios) serves as
  a framework for speculating on how a critical asset like Bitcoin might eventually
  be "nationalized" or integrated into state apparatus if sovereign debt crises deepen.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that Bitcoin’s next major phase of adoption hinges on
  its transition from a purely speculative store of value to a functional, pledgeable
  collateral asset at the nation-state level, potentially mirroring the historical
  arc of gold. The plumbing demonstrated in Argentina (swap lines, ESF) offers a tangible
  roadmap for where Bitcoin could become useful as a "true currency" at the B2B or
  sovereign level, rather than just individual retail transactions.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto and Traditional Finance Professionals, Macro Investors, and Institutional
  Strategists.** Those interested in the intersection of central banking policy, reserve
  asset management, and the long-term structural case for Bitcoin will find this most
  valuable.'
