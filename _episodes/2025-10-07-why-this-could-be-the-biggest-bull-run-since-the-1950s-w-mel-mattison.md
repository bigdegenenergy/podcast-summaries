    money velocity (V) over sheer money creation (M), a key MMT concept.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What's important is the growth of the money supply. Part of the growth of
    the money supply is V, velocity. Velocity is extremely small. And what that means
    is that even though dollars are being created, they're not circulating through
    the system at a very high level because there's not a huge level of credit issuance.

summary: '## Comprehensive Summary: Milk Road Macro Episode with Mel Madison (October
  6th)


  This episode of Milk Road Macro features host John Gillen interviewing macro analyst
  Mel Madison, a former FinTech executive with deep historical market knowledge, to
  discuss the current market environment, historical parallels, and potential Q4 catalysts.


  ### 1. Main Narrative Arc and Key Discussion Points


  The central narrative revolves around Madison’s conviction that the current market
  rally, dubbed an **"everything everywhere all at once" rally** (involving bonds,
  stocks, gold, Bitcoin, and real estate), is the precursor to an **"epic bull run"**
  reminiscent of the 1950s, rather than just the 1990s. Madison argues that contemporary
  investors, even the oldest ones, lack the living memory of these powerful, multi-decade
  growth periods, leading to skepticism about current market dynamics. The discussion
  pivots from historical market structure to the critical role of the Federal Reserve''s
  mandates and the potential re-emergence of **Yield Curve Control (YCC)**, framed
  within a new geopolitical structure echoing the 1950s Cold War alignments.


  ### 2. Major Topics, Themes, and Subject Areas Covered


  *   **Market Outlook:** Prediction of a short-lived 15-20% correction followed by
  an epic bull run.

  *   **Historical Analogies:** Strong emphasis on the **1950s** as the best parallel
  for current market performance (S&P average returns >19%), surpassing the 1990s.

  *   **AI and Sector Rotation:** Discussion on the concentration of the current rally
  (e.g., Mag Seven) and the potential shift away from the dominance of **Software
  as a Service (SaaS)** due to the fundamental devaluation of coding brought by AI.

  *   **Technological Disruption:** Mention of **tokenization of equities** and its
  disruptive potential.

  *   **Federal Reserve Mandates:** Deep dive into the original three mandates of
  the Fed (vs. the commonly cited two).

  *   **Geopolitics and Macro Cycles:** Drawing parallels between current global tensions
  (Russia/China vs. West/Japan) and the post-WWII/Korean War era (1950s).

  *   **Emerging Markets:** Strong bullish stance on **Emerging Markets (EM)**, specifically
  citing Brazil (EWZ) due to its strategic importance and resource wealth.


  ### 3. Technical Concepts, Methodologies, or Frameworks Discussed


  *   **"Everything Everywhere All at Once" Rally:** A term describing broad asset
  class appreciation.

  *   **Paradigm Shifts:** Fundamental breakdowns in historical correlations (e.g.,
  Gold/Dollar, Unemployment/GDP), driven by interest rate cycles.

  *   **The Debatement Trade:** A concept Madison has discussed for years, now gaining
  mainstream traction (e.g., at Goldman Sachs/Morgan Stanley).

  *   **Yield Curve Control (YCC):** Explicitly mentioned as a historical tool used
  in the 1950s, potentially relevant again to maintain "moderate long-term interest
  rates."

  *   **Humphrey Hawkins Act (1970s):** Referenced as the source of the modern dual
  mandate, though Madison highlights the original three mandates.


  ### 4. Business Implications and Strategic Insights


  *   **Index Fund Skepticism:** Madison suggests that the current acceptance of index
  funds may hurt investors as the market broadens beyond the concentrated winners
  (Mag Seven).

  *   **Active Management Opportunity:** Madison boasts significant outperformance
  (>100% YTD on his portfolio), arguing that beating the market is achievable outside
  of massive capital constraints.

  *   **AI Impact on Tech Valuation:** The transformative nature of AI may lead to
  a rotation away from pure SaaS models toward broader industrial/transformative plays,
  similar to the railroad boom.


  ### 5. Key Personalities, Experts, or Thought Leaders Mentioned


  *   **Mel Madison:** The featured expert, former FinTech executive, and long-term
  market predictor.

  *   **John Gillen:** Host of Milk Road Macro.

  *   **Jordi Visser:** Previous guest who discussed AI concentration.

  *   **Warren Pies, Luke Gromin, Larry the Part:** Mentioned as part of the cohort
  discussing the "debatement trade" years ago.

  *   **Jim Bianco:** Mentioned regarding commentary on the labor market and Fed mandates.

  *   **Warren Buffett:** Used as a benchmark for long-term market experience, noting
  even he may not have seen the current market structure.

  *   **Jeffrey Gundlach:** Mentioned in the context of investors lacking memory of
  the 1950s returns.

  *   **Nick Timiraos / Miran:** Mentioned in connection with bringing up the third
  Fed mandate.

  *   **F.D. Griffin / G. Edward Griffin (Creature from Jekyll Island):** Referenced
  in the historical context of the Fed''s creation.


  ### 6. Predictions, Trends, or Future-Looking Statements


  *   The current rally is leading into a multi-decade bull run comparable to the
  1950s.

  *   AI will cause a fundamental shift, potentially devaluing some current SaaS monopolies.

  *   Geopolitical fault lines are redrawing along 1950s lines (US/West/Japan vs.
  Russia/China).

  *   The **"End of the Fed"** movement, currently fringe, may gain mainstream traction
  as the Fed''s role is scrutinized.


  ### 7. Practical Applications and Real-World Examples


  *   **Investment Trades:** Madison cited his successful calls, including buying
  EM calls for 40 cents and his early conviction in **'
