    works. Right? So basically, make it such that you literally physically cannot

summary: '## Podcast Summary: The Stablecoin Competition Is On. Who Will Be the Winners
  and Losers? - Ep. 920


  This 66-minute episode of *Unchained* features host Laura Shin, Rob Hadeck (Dragonfly),
  and Murt Memtas (Filius) discussing the rapidly evolving and intensifying competition
  within the stablecoin market, particularly in the wake of anticipated US stablecoin
  legislation (the Clarity Act). The central theme is the shift from a few dominant
  stablecoins to a potential proliferation driven by application-layer incentives.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **Stablecoin Landscape and Competition**, examining the
  strategic motivations behind various entities (applications, infrastructure providers,
  and issuers) launching or integrating their own stablecoins. Secondary themes include
  the implications of regulation, user experience (UX), and the difference between
  retail and B2B adoption drivers.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Abstraction as a UX Solution:** The eventual endgame for retail users might
  involve abstracting away stablecoin tickers (e.g., showing everything as "USD"),
  forcing issuers to compete on yield or service quality in the background.

  *   **Liquidity Management Challenges:** While abstracting tickers is technically
  feasible, managing the liquidity pools and slippage across dozens of non-perfectly
  fungible stablecoin liabilities remains a significant operational hurdle.

  *   **B2B Settlement Potential:** The B2B market ($200T) could see stablecoins used
  for global treasury management and merchant settlement without needing constant
  fiat on/off ramps, fundamentally changing friction points in cross-border finance.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Incentive Alignment Drives Issuance:** Companies with distribution (applications
  like Phantom or Jupiter) are incentivized to issue their own stablecoins to "own
  how economics are distributed" and capture associated revenue/yield, leading to
  an "unbundling" phase.

  *   **Tether''s Moat vs. Circle''s Potential:** Tether maintains a massive brand
  recognition moat, especially in the Global South for P2P use, while Circle (USDC)
  is seen as potentially stronger in the institutional/regulated B2B space due to
  its transparency and public company status.

  *   **Yield Extraction:** Sophisticated retail users are currently chasing yield
  (e.g., using PYUSD on Camino for 12%), but the mass market adoption relies on default
  settings within applications, not active yield farming.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Tether (USDT):** Highlighted for its unparalleled brand recognition and dominance
  in the Global South/remittance markets.

  *   **Circle (USDC):** Positioned as the likely choice for regulated B2B use cases
  due to transparency and public status, despite revenue-sharing agreements (e.g.,
  with Coinbase).

  *   **Athena, Agorá, Paxos:** Mentioned as key infrastructure providers offering
  "stablecoin-as-a-service" or white-label solutions, enabling applications to launch
  their own tokens.

  *   **Jupiter & Phantom:** Examples of major applications leveraging infrastructure
  providers (like Athena) to launch ecosystem stablecoins to capture economic distribution.

  *   **Nick Carter:** His analysis suggesting many dominant stablecoins will emerge,
  driven by intermediaries wanting yield, framed the discussion.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The passage of the **Clarity Act (US stablecoin law)** is seen as the catalyst that
  legitimizes the playing field, making users less concerned about counterparty risk
  among regulated issuers and more focused on yield and integration benefits. However,
  the discussion noted that regulatory parity might push applications toward issuing
  their own tokens rather than relying solely on regulated issuers.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is currently in a phase of **unbundling**, where many application-specific
  stablecoins emerge. This is predicted to eventually lead to a **rebundling** phase,
  either through a centralized clearinghouse model (less optimal) or a consolidation
  around 5-7 major, interchangeable brands/service providers. The long-term success
  of any stablecoin hinges on whether it captures the default user experience (retail)
  or the trust/transparency requirements of institutions (B2B).


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto/Web3 Professionals, Investors, and
  Fintech Strategists** who need to understand the competitive dynamics, regulatory
  impact, and strategic incentives driving the next wave of stablecoin adoption and
  infrastructure development.'
