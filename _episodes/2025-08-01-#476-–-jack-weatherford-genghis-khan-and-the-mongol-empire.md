  extracted: say that this is the the time of the summer I yeah Japan so so there
    was never a real test of like that no there was some fighting and the summer I
    learned some very valuable things the summer I had such a ritualized way of like
    the Knights of Europe coming out with armor that had to be lifted up on a crane
    onto a horse and I mean it was just craziness crazy to the summer right almost
    at that point you ride out in front of your enemy and you recite the story of
    your genealogy all right what you know Mongols they have no use for that are there
    there to fight they're there to win but on the other hand this was a unknown territory
    to them and the weather did turn against them but I don't want to give too much
    credit to weather I really think that the Japanese defeated them the Mongols weren't
    well prepared their ships were not very good they were defeated in the first invasion
    could they get off the ships onto the beach or they did they had some skirmishes
    or small battles on land yes they did but they didn't successfully complete them
    no no so they couldn't do their usual Mongol thing you're right well see they
    don't have enough horses for one thing yeah you know and uh there were many tactical
    things that they had done incorrectly it's the first time anybody had ever tried
    to have such a massive invasion yeah so they're just learning the basics of what
    it means to have a navy so he has failed to conquer and he's thinking like a Mongol
    that you rule the those waters and lands but he ruled the ocean he stopped the
    trade he stopped the supply he cut off the possibility of the Song Dynasty fleeing
    to Japan he won in a certain way he lost but he had won his objective of cutting
    off southern China also it gave him navy some experience with the ocean and now
    they were ready to move out into the ocean around southern China so they were
    closing in then Aju was in command but actually the head command was a man named
    Bayan who was a Mongol who had been raised more in Central Asia he was perhaps
    born close to the Fagana Valley in that area we're not exactly sure where he's
    born but he grew up over there and then he eventually was living in what's now
    Iran what he came and he took over command of the army he was very cosmopolitan
    sophisticated intelligent Aju should have been in command but Bayan recognized
    that and he and Aju worked together very well Aju knew how to fight the war Bayan
    was able to negotiate things back with the capital city and handle things so Bayan
    is in command and so the generals are deserting the south song right and left
    the artisans are all coming up to join the Mongols great-paid the generals are
    loading up the boats with all the jewels and they grab a couple of brothers to
    the little five-year-old emperor and they put them on a boat and they're fleeing
    they even deserted their own families the generals were corrupt cowards who fled
    the person left in charge was the Dowager Empress an old lady shout no children
    she was her name the Dowager Empress she they said she was missing an eye she
    was ugly they're a cullter ugly she that's what they called her at that time she
    was in charge and she offered the Mongols everything I'll give you everything
    please let the Empress stay okay even if you demote him to just being a king please
    let him stay Bayan said no total surrender total surrender so she decided to surrender
    well she said yes we will surrender the capital so Bayan came in with a small
    group of soldiers they looked around and she invited him to come to the palace
    to surrender and he said no I didn't win this war in the palace my soldiers won
    this war in the field you have to come with the emperor in front of my soldiers
    to surrender but he did not harm her he respected her and there was no looting
    of the city now later they take everything in a very systematic way they take
    the archives and all this kind of stuff away but there's no wholesale looting
    a killing of people nothing like that so they've taken the capital and she comes
    out she surrenders she bows on the ground towards Beijing and then she takes the
    child emperor and they slowly make their way she was a little bit sick it took
    her a longer time to Beijing and they surrender again in a public ceremony bowing
    to the Kubla Khan he gives each of them a palace he gives them a new new title
    he probably is trying to show the world this is the new face of Mongols we don't
    kill off the old people anymore who are really we're going to give them a palace
    treat them nicely and all but the navy that had fled did not defend the city those
    cowardly generals they made the new little boy seven-year-old brother half brother
    to to Emperor Gong was his name they made him the emperor well they're just floating
    around in the ocean losing all support from city after city the Muslims who were
    controlling the trade and controlling many of the ships of that area they were
    Chinese Muslims but they were still Muslims they switched sides to the Mongols
    because of the religious freedom thing and because they were merchants and their
    status would be raised so the the Muslims were switching over the fleet was kind
    of a fleet lost without a country out there they had some loyal supporters some
    places are they dropped the emperor into ocean what do you mean how do you drop
    the emperor into ocean they accidentally spilled him into ocean and then they
    fished him out but he died so fortunately they had one more seven-year-old half
    brother so on Lentao island exactly where the Hong Kong airport is today the new
    well it's not so new anymore but I still think it was the new airport on Lentao
    island so they went there and they had a big coronation ceremony and all but the
    people there were not supportive enough it certainly wasn't Hong Kong then anyway
    at the delta of the Pearl River so they they sailed out farther south to another
    island and then they took it over and of course the first thing they did was well
    we have to build a palace what the Mongols are chasing you and you can stop and
    build a palace so these are like the remains of the Chinese yes the generals and
    the generals army and the navy and there was a real competence issue yes okay
    so they're going to build a house we're going to protect it with a great wall
    of the sea they chained together the boats across the entrance to the harbor and
    they put a palace boat so called in the middle the generals didn't trust their
    own soldiers enough so they made all of them leave the island and go to the boats
    to fight the Mongols so Mongols arrived in over and over and over they asked them
    to surrender you won't be harmed all this kind of stuff and all and but the Mongols
    now took over the land so they had the water all around them and they had the
    land and once the fighting started they could just shoot down from the highland
    right onto the ships and they've cut the ships off from the fresh supply of of
    wood and water so they can't boil rice they have to try to eat rice and drink
    sea water they're all sick as dogs out there and the leaders refused to surrender
    the little boy is their seven-year-old emperor Bing was his name with his pet
    parrot that's the only thing he had left in life was his pet parrot and then the
    Mongols they offered every opportunity but the prime minister so called coward
    that he is although he's treated as a hero today in China and throughout their
    history but coward that he was he said we will not disgrace the country by letting
    them capture the emperor so first he threw his own wife and children into the
    water to drown and then he took the emperor and held him the seven-year-old he
    was seven years and one month he had just turned seven years old and jumped into
    the water with this child a child murderer he's a child murderer to do that somehow
    in the whole ruckus the cage came undone with the parrot and the parrot fell in
    the water too so the seven-year-old boy and the parrot died in the water that
    was the end of one of the greatest dynasties in the history of the world the song
    dynasty they were intellectually great they were artistically great they were
    technologically great they were just one of the greatest moments of world history
    and it ends with this coward killing a child and his pet parrot in order to save
    the honor that was betrayed by this woman the men lost the war the men lost the
    war who's to blame an old one-eyed ugly lady imprisciate well the bigger picture
    there is probably is it's become the institutions became corrupt and stale and
    the the army weakened and the politician the politician class probably have have
    lost their skill and competence at ruling and all that kind of stuff and all that
    is true and the and the Chinese summarized that with losing the mandate of heaven
    right i mean everybody has their perspective maybe if uh the way you told the
    story has a very kind of objective sort of way of revealing the absurdity and
    the cowardice of it but you know this probably the Chinese perspectives that they
    tell the story in some kind like maintained honor to the last yes to the last
    moment they very often most scholars depict impriscio as the traitor to the country
    and i say no that boy lived on for another 45 years and so she did not betray
    the country she protected or emperor that she was supposed to protect it was the
    man who killed the child emperor who killed young bing so what was the lasting
    impact of Kublai Kahn unifying China well yes first of all he had unified China
    in the largest sense of the word with Korea to bet manchuria Mongolia part of
    central Asia he had unified it but he did so at the expense of his empire they
    didn't recognize him as the great emperor and there was a great opposition from
    the golden horde of russia and also from the the central region which is called
    the the chagatayid the descendants of sagade the second son the chagatay empire
    and then from the ilkaneit of Persia these are the different sort of fracturings
    of the Mongolian sons of jingus kahn yeah and only the ilkaneit was still loyal
    to him but they're so far away yeah but now he has a navy but this is i mean even
    the four pieces the whole thing is gigantic and even the pieces of gigantic so
    i mean it's very hard to keep an empire of this size together yes but he had china
    it was unified under him and then he he sent out the first expedition to sail
    directly to persia there had been trade all throughout thousands of years but
    i was usually port to port you know different merchants shading goods no he organized
    a great fleet to send a queen our princess to become queen in the ilkaneit to
    marry the the ilkane of persia it's persia and as are by john and armenia and
    rack and part of syria all of that area so he said organized this and it so happened
    that marco polo was ready to go home because they knew kubelicon was about to
    die and in fact he only had about one year left to live and they wanted to get
    their riches out before they didn't know what's going to happen this is a new
    dynasty they've been in total control of china for one generation and they didn't
    know what was going to happen and also just before that there'd been a bad time
    because kubelicon had tried to invade japan a second time and he had failed a
    second time and the second time i think again he had a practical purpose and net
    was he had this whole huge song army that now he's the new enlightened mongol
    who doesn't slaughter so he's got what is he going to do they're not reliable
    they're not safe so he sends a bunch of them up into the almuha river of what's
    down the russian far east or we call Siberian English but the russian far east
    almuha river he sent expeditions up into to bet exploring options up there but
    there wasn't enough room or enough agricultural area for huge military colony
    but most of his ships were loaded with former prisoners of the war from the song
    dynasty and they were not armed they had hos and implements for farming he wanted
    to create obviously an agricultural military agricultural farm in japan to help
    feed northern china because it was very important just as they were doing with
    the almuha river but it was more complicated so again they lost they didn't have
    it and part of it reason is the the exposition was massive and they organized
    it in the mongol principles of left wing right wing this didn't work at sea because
    the left wing is from korea there's korean ships built up there the right wing
    is from southern china mostly with ships built down there they're not the same
    they have a head but there's no center point jingus Khan always had the goal they
    called it gul the goal the center or or qoel actually all by did he had the center
    in command no he sent the two without a clear and they were arguing with each
    other not cooperating not helping each other sabotaging each other they get there
    once again they have the same problems even though they've come with lots of grenades
    this time again the grenades are exploding they're they're scaring the horses
    you know it's impressive and a lot of silk screens are made later showing these
    impressive battles and all but they're lost and again a typhoon happened to be
    the final the final destruction of the navy but i think it's japan had defeated
    the mongols i would say japanese deserve credit for that victory and then the
    the thinking of the ships was more caused by the by the typhoon but already the
    japanese had developed good strategies while the mongols have been away they knew
    how the mongols fought and they knew that at night they could fire flaming arrows
    at the ships set them on fire and they were doing great damage so again kublakhan
    lost the invasion of japan but the soldiers were gone they drowned he didn't kill
    them off was his deliberate plan but the problem was solved it's one of those
    ironies of history that is harder quite understand so this had happened but then
    kublakhan was coming to the near the end of life and marco polo and those wanted
    to get out they're ready to go and kublakhan allowed them to sail on this expedition
    with hukshin was her name the princess hukshin to go to a hormous and so they
    went and that began a whole system of trade back and forth back and forth kublakhan
    died soon after that his grandson who's not so well respected in history because
    he's often called a drunk but his name was tumur tumur and jetu but he was a drunk
    when he was young but his grandfather had him cained a couple times in public
    and he cured him of drinking and actually he was not a drunk later on and he was
    first he knew reassembled the mongol empire he did the golden horde declared loyalty
    to him recognize him as great hon is emperor of the whole empire the chagatahi
    de central aja they declared loyalty to him the ill Khanate was already loyal
    to him they all declared loyalty he had reassembled the empire and he had the
    greatest navy in the world and he sent out on voice to every place they had attacked
    or traded with to say that era is over we're no longer attacking anybody we're
    changing from conquest to commerce we want to trade with you come to china bring
    your goods we're going to trade with you he instituted it was short unfortunately
    didn't last forever i wish it could have but it was a great era of the exchange
    of all kinds of things going back and forth all the way actually all the way to
    Africa kosram or mous they had connection to somale land and some people say can
    you already at that time i'm not sure but very wide very wide so technically he
    ruled over the the largest size the mongol empire ever had yes but although actually
    the golden horde of russia they were quite independent by now and he let them
    be independent but they were loyal to him and they were still exchanging back
    and forth all kinds of things so there were osetian soldiers in china that had
    a whole contingent of osetian soldiers there and from russia from the caucus areas
    of russia and how do they communicate are they using like the postal service they
    have to you have to literally deliver the letters no over time those groups started
    intermarrying with they were allowed to enter married the chinese were not but
    they were intermarrying with mongols and they were switching to mongolian language
    slowly at first i don't know it's not clear but again Kubla Khan thinking in this
    internationalist way said okay we need a new alphabet for the world everybody
    in the world right with one alphabet chinese mongolian russian arabic everything
    it didn't work but he tried it for a while and some inscriptions are still there
    to this day and we should maybe briefly mention markupo that you've talked about
    so he is this now famous explorer that traversed the continent does so crowed
    and then stayed with Kubla Khan for a while and i guess one is one of the primary
    documenters of everything that's been going on is there something else interesting
    to say about about markupo and about his interaction with Kubla Khan i like markupo
    though i use i use his work a lot i find him very reliable in the areas where
    he's not reliable you can kind of tell because he didn't he wasn't there but the
    places he was he reported a lot of stuff and so i'm very much indebted to him
    for a lot of things because with something like the princess hukjin and also another
    fighting princess from central azure named hutulum he wrote about that but i also
    needed other sources so i found if i could find chinese sources or arab sources
    or something else or person to support it then i really felt a lot of confidence
    with him over time but pieces were romanticized and you have to always discount
    it but is very good however i believe the best work written about markupo as i
    from his own book which was actually written by rista cello dictated in prison
    in jenua you know in the 20th century ujino nio wrote a play that became a comedy
    on broadway called marko millions that was both a play on what he was called el
    milioni the million one because he had talked about cities of millions of people
    and about money in the millions and things that people in europe just couldn't
    believe could happen he then published his whole play as a book to show people
    what he really meant and it was an ironic look at capitalism because this is 20th
    century already versus the idea of like a philosopher king which he saw in kublecon
    it's oh markupolo becomes a symbol of capitalism not at its worst but at its most
    basic and that is like the princess in this story this is not in real life but
    this is in the play written by ujino nio by i think it captures a lot the princess
    hukshin says marko is an excellent judge of quantity and there are things like
    that and then in the play bion the great general it talks with kublecon and he
    said look these people are dangerous from the west we should go conquer them now
    while we can kublecon tells bion again in the play this is fiction but it tells
    bion they are not worth conquering and if we conquer them we will become like
    them and he said marko polo has been in our land he has seen everything he has
    learned nothing he has seen everything he understands nothing for me this was
    such an important moment in the history of the world symbolically with marko polo
    and kublecon the coming together of two worlds it could have gone a different
    way could have gone a different way and i am it's not that i'm anti-capitalist
    i'm pro-capitalist but the way so many things worked out it was a misstep in history
    maybe we took the wrong step at that moment and we could have learned more from
    cooperation they didn't quite integrate successfully no but today we've returned
    to that i think the east and the west are confronting each other again on more
    equal terms for a long time the west was so dominant and the east was so downtrodden
    by colonialism and other things an internal rot and other things but today there's
    none is there equality but there's more of a balance and which way will we go
    and again there's a lot of room and a lot of energy for division for misunderstanding
    versus integration like the the east is demonized in the west and one of the great
    regrets i have that i hope to alleviate is just how little i understand china
    in the east it's just sort of not not just from kind of economics politics you
    know reading a few books but like the way you've understood and felt them ongoing
    step like understand the chinese people in that way because it does feel like
    from that understanding there could be integration of ideas you know my work is
    often classified as chinese history which i think is ironic because for me it's
    always a mongolian history but for the last book i wrote which dealt a lot more
    with china because it was about kubla Khan then in that book i deliberately did
    not go to china i'd been there numerous times before i deliberately did not i'm
    an outsider i do not speak chinese i'm not a chinese scholar i never even had
    a course in chinese art or calligraphy or anything and i wanted to be very clear
    mine is an outside perspective but i think it's possible as an outsider to still
    have respect for that culture even if i disagree that they point this one as a
    hero and that one's as devilent i disagree and they'll say all i'm wrong i don't
    understand their history and they're probably right that's quite possible but
    this is an outside view that is different and tries to be respectful of what happens
    in that part of the world just as i'm respectful towards chinghoshan and the mongol
    empire i respect china very much i'm an american i love the ideals of my country
    i love so many aspects of our culture and there are many aspects i don't of course
    because it's impossible to love everything even about the members of your own
    family you know and i do hope that through understanding one another are just
    making the effort to understand even if we understand wrongly and we're incorrect
    in it just to make the effort to understand will help us a lot and the west has
    had a long couple of centuries of extreme arrogance that they are there to teach
    the world and i sometimes this made i meet these young people all over the world
    who have come to help they're an NGO and they're going to teach the people how
    to take care of the environment they're going to teach the women how to exercise
    their rights they're going to bring in micro financing to help liberate people
    we are arrogant beyond words and we need to be a little bit more humble and try
    to put ourselves on an equal basis where some of these people not as a period
    basis beautifully put how did the mongol empire come to an end how did it fall
    despite the fact that tumultal jittuhan had united the empire at least symbolically
    all of it and they had the trade going on the mongols never adapted well to china
    and they began having problems in different areas so in some areas of the world
    they became more like the local people so in central Asia they became Muslim and
    they got more absorbed into that world and broke from the mongol examples from
    before russia lingered on longer under mongol domination but it got weaker and
    weaker over time and it was based around the vulgar river but the week until the
    point that they just became a tributary people minority within a russian empire
    but the mongols had left as the framework for empire for russia that's something
    russians don't want to hear any more they want to hear me criticize the end of
    the song dynasty but it is true that even yam yam is the word that was used for
    this postal system and that's the ministries today and russia and there many many
    other things or in russia so even malchik malchin is a herder mal is a person
    is a animal and chin is a person a person takes care of animals you know it's
    all kinds of influences in russia that some people wanted to die but there's always
    a great powerful strand of research and scholarship in russia that supports this
    understanding of the mongols and I depend on them tremendously it's not just a
    gumballjolf is one of the famous ones but he was a little bit too romantic with
    his ideas and all but I depend upon a lot of the research and done by russian
    scholars and by early german scholars in the 19th century under sponsorship of
    the tar so I depend on that work so you had a great influence there but it was
    weakening so bit by bit 1368 the mongols have become so weak within china that
    they were overthrown but they weren't absorbed into china but the mongols have
    been there since 1215 to 1368 they packed up went back to mongolia it was just
    another seasonal migration yeah you know it was just amazing and they said okay
    we're still the uand dynasty we're not giving you the seals we're not acknowledging
    the ming and they'd ever did throughout the whole of the ming in fact they went
    down one time and captured the main emperor taking back the mongolia and then
    they tried to ransom him and the Chinese said no we're going to point to another
    emperor so the mongols decided okay the worst thing we can do to the chinese is
    give them back the old emperor so you had two emperors you know back okay let
    them work it out you know and the empire just weakened from internal reasons for
    the mongols but some external things from nature and i think that was the great
    plague you know everything in history everything that's good comes with something
    underneath that that's bad and everything this bad seems to have something underneath
    that sometimes works out good anyway but this great system that united it's called
    the yam or or to that united everything people could move back and forth quickly
    then it could also take the plague out of southern china into all parts of the
    world and i do think that's what happened and the plague destroyed the mongol
    system and if all of these people are ruled by mongols because they're benefiting
    so much from this system and now the system collapses yeah you don't need the
    empire anymore yeah so it just fell apart after 1368 the empire just fell apart
    and most of them stayed stayed in Persia and Iran and Afghanistan the hazara people
    are still descended from the army there and then in russia some of them stayed
    but then finally in the time of catholic great a lot of them were returned little
    pair they had been there for hundreds of years and then they returned to mongolia
    in the 1700s and so many mongols came home they were still mongols despite hundreds
    of years of exposure to other cultures they came back to their tent and squatting
    around the fire and drinking fermented milk and eating dried curds it's interesting
    that the the mongolian spirit is so strong that it persists yes through centuries
    yes i think it's just return right back on the horse riding in the open step yeah
    well it was actually very difficult because they were a little bit lazy and they
    weren't so good with doing the task and so it became difficult actually to support
    so many people coming home and eating up all the animals the mongols in china
    had been used to just eating they hadn't been producing much for 150 years so
    just a return to jengus con we talked about dan karlan and dan karlan said that
    jengus con's army was the greatest military force in history and many other historians
    agree that before rifles came into popular use jengus con would basically beat
    every single army including napolian and you mentioned the summarize the whole
    formal setup same with napolian there's just there's a whole you know like you
    know several hours to set up the chess pieces on the military board i mean you
    can just imagine what jengus con and the the the dynamism the the speed of everything
    what that would do to napolian so i guess the question is where do you agree with
    that notion that jengus con's army is the greatest military force in history so
    it answers yes absolutely no other power in the history of the world has conquered
    russia and china and perja and central aja and terky and korea no power in the
    world has done that not Alexander not the Romans nobody will ever do it again
    nobody's going to conquer china and russia again and rule both countries it's
    just not going to happen what lessons i mean can you take from that's applicable
    to modern warfare oh i think there's a very good lesson and the mongols took a
    rack they took back that they held it the americans we followed the exact opposite
    strategy of the mongols mongol strategy is first you take the countryside their
    country people they think in terms of countryside you take the countryside you
    occupy the countryside and you cut off the city it cannot live without the countryside
    and that's how they did it every time they would come in as i say in some cases
    two two years in advance to clear people out so they would have room for their
    horses and have pasture for their horses and all and you take the small towns
    and in the small cities and then the last one is the big city americans they said
    no we're going to take Baghdad we're going to bomb Baghdad we're going to have
    this shock and awe we're going to go in we conquer the country from Baghdad so
    they go in they get trapped in their little tiny green zone they never conquer
    a rack the strongest army in the world you know this is something that worked
    in europe world war two yes we bombed the cities and we took the city because
    that was the city the center of production for the modern era but the countryside
    is the place that produces the food the mongols were very aware of that and supplies
    the water you cut off the water from the city you cut off the food for the city
    what's the city going to do they're going to surrender the americans were applying
    something that worked in western europe to conquer Germany it did not work to
    conquer a rack or vietnam or even northern korea or cambodia or laos or syria
    or god no it worked only in grenade i think that's the only in my lifetime that's
    the only successful war we had lasted a couple of hours we went in conquered the
    little tiny island otherwise we've been chased out of every country we've lost
    it tail between our legs we dropped more bombs on cambodia than we dropped on
    germany it's hard to believe hard to believe we dropped more bombs on cambodia
    than on germany we did nothing because germany you destroy the cities the people
    surrender terrestrial is gone frankford fritzburg berlin uh in cambodia you can
    bomb the countryside forever you can kill the people and they did you can use
    chemical warfare and they did and you could still go into the eastern part of
    cambodia and you could go to a large areas where you don't hear birds singing
    because of the chemical warfare and the merit of american bombs so we still do
    it but we don't want to admit it and we don't want to go into win when world war
    two the americans did have unconditional surrender well i mean you could support
    the war not support the war we did it right we did it wrong these are all issues
    that people can argue but we had a clear policy we go into afghanistan we're fighting
    terror we're going to bring democracy we're going to free the women what i mean
    it's an absolute sheer insanity the things that we did and we kill people not
    only did we use chemical warfare and kill a lot of people in vietnam and laos
    and and cambodia we killed american soldiers we killed american soldiers and my
    father was one he died from agent orange disease oh but that doesn't count he
    didn't die on the battlefield and we didn't mean to kill him it doesn't count
    modern warfare is brutal and we just paper over it sometimes you know can you
    explain agent orange it was designed to kill all vegetation this is going to be
    a humane way we're going to kill all the vegetation in the jungle and that way
    they can stop moving the army through the jungle and they can stop the supplies
    from coming that was american strategy yeah henry kissinger no bell price winner
    he is now resting in hell is exactly where he belongs for what he did to Vietnam
    laos and cambodia the bombing was just absolutely horrendous so agent orange comes
    in they defoliated which means they wiped out the crop so people are starving
    literally in the case of cambodia starving to death the animals are being killed
    and deformed children are being born to this day and american soldiers died by
    the thousands not immediately not on the not on the battlefield not right there
    they go home they have the disease they linger they take the whole family down
    with them in an emotional trauma of becoming slowly paralyzed and dying we did
    that to our own people so yeah warfare i don't think we're any more humane with
    it any better today than in the past it's just we can hide parts of it more easily
    and deny it more easily if you're killed by a mongol it's very clear you're killed
    by a mongol you're killed by friendly fire in american war so different matter
    it seems that what people mean when they say that war is hell that's in some deep
    sense everybody loses no matter the narrative you put on top of it yes yes i'm
    not a pacifist again but i think war is acceptable in some situations but the
    more controlled it is the better my my effort is not to do away with all the things
    that happened under Chinggis Han with the brutality and all like that but it's
    to measure it against what goes on today in the world today and we have the different
    images there are two images of Chinggis Han one is our image he's a barbarian
    on a horseback killing people and raping women all the time the other image is
    the Mongolian image and when they finally built an official statue of him in that
    in this century for the 800th anniversary of his founding of Mongolia that to
    think about how to present him to the world and to themselves and they chose the
    link and memorial as the model he was the late great log river of the Mongol nation
    and so he's seated there in front of the Mongolian parliament there's another
    statue that's better known but it was a private enterprise that created him on
    a horseback but not with a weapon but he's on horseback out in the countryside
    but the official one for the government is Chinggis Han seated like Abraham Lincoln
    and they issued stamps to show that he is the great log giver and the truth is
    somewhere in between well they are depending on where you are and how you want
    to see it you know there are many things that happen that were terrible and horrible
    and for people who lose a war it's going to always be terrible and horrible yeah
    let's return back to Chinggis Han's life and the end of it how and where did he
    die after conquering the Horaism empire in central Asia Chinggis Han returned
    and then they had a great what they called not him a great celebration that went
    on for a whole summer just about it they had so much wealth to distribute to everybody
    and everybody is being given all kinds of things you know for what they have done
    and including the people who helped save him when he was in the in the kank and
    the in the ox yolk they were rewarded with everybody was rewarded it was a great
    time but the first place he had attacked outside was the Tanguit nation and they
    had sworn allegiance to him and then when he went off to the middle east they
    refused to send troops he didn't forget that he's going back to the Tanguit nation
    and he's going to conquer them again as he was crossing the goby which takes a
    while and you're crossing the goby he was distracted a little bit by hunting the
    hulawn which is the wild we say the wild ass or I used to say wild horse it sounds
    a little better but the hulawn to say hulawn of the goby he was off hunting hulawn
    he fell from his horse and he injured his leg very badly and he seemed to decline
    from that point and it took some number of months before August of 1227 he was
    very much near the end of life you can read online the exact date and it's all
    very specific but the truth is we don't know exactly which day he died in that
    time because he's one of his wives wise running the camp and they were keeping
    it secret until the defeat of the Tanguit was completed and the Tanguit offered
    all kinds of things to for the Mongols to go away again the second time and Chinggis
    Han had told his family no except nothing and then when they surrender you kill
    the royal family kill them all so that the idea they were they were Buddhist people
    the Tanguits were Buddhist and the idea was usually you can be reborn into your
    own family but he said no you kill off the whole family so they can't be reborn
    so he died there how is he successor chosen oh the succession issue was always
    difficult he did not have the right to appoint a successor that was not de mongo
    way he can nominate somebody so before he set off for the Middle Eastern campaign
    one of his wives said to him you know even the biggest tree falls you've got to
    make a plan and talk to your sons about the future so he did he called the sons
    together so this is zooch the oldest boy who is born while the father was allied
    with his anda jamauk and he was named visitor zooch and then the next one was
    chagaday and the next one was a good day and the next one was tole the father
    of of Kubla Khan but he was still alive at this point so all four of them came
    so chinghaskan explained to them he wanted to talk about the succession and to
    get some consensus from them about the succession and so he said the mongols always
    call on people to speak by order of age they also serve tea or food anything by
    order of age it's always done that way from then till now so he called first on
    zooch and he said what do you say zooch chinghaskan favored zooch this is the
    one who was christianal paternity but he always favored him you know the youngest
    tiller was too hot headed a good day was a heavy drinker chagaday was very rigid
    about the law of the mongols and all you know but he thought he seemed to favor
    zooch as a more reasonable good warrior but reasonable person but he called on
    zooch my son speak chagaday the second one who believes in mongolaw supposedly
    he jumped up and he said this is when he accused his father of all kinds of he
    said how can you call on this mongol this market bastard if you call on him first
    that means you want him to be the great Khan he should not be the great Khan of
    the mongol empire is this mongol empire now on and you know you can imagine kind
    of seen well chinkus han is the greatest ruler in the world he's sitting there
    being lectured by his second son and this is when he gave that impassioned speech
    to his now in the actually the way the secret history it makes it look like it
    was his assistant speaker who said it because very often the great power doesn't
    say the words directly they let somebody else say them form have a spokesperson
    but anyway I think it was his words and I think he said them on that day that's
    what I think on this business of you do not know you were not there you know the
    stars were moving in the sky the head was head was turning around the earth was
    turning over you do not know who loved who you do not know who your mother loved
    you do not know what your mother did and if I say he is my son who are you to
    say he is not my son by the way pretty just really high integrity really respectable
    to do that to have that respect and honor his wife in this way yes and the son
    in this way it's really powerful I believe that I don't know if she was alive
    at this point or not we do not have the death recorded mongols are not good at
    recording death they don't they usually just say somebody finished their age or
    they have some euphemism for it but he made that in passion speech and so God
    they had to submit and he said yes you are our father and we accept what you say
    but a dear shot with words cannot be loaded on a horse a dear shot with words
    cannot be eaten so sing us Han knew so he said to the boys the boys I mean these
    middle age men they're not boys but he said to the men what do you want to do
    what do you want to do and he said I don't favor it's like I day because of his
    attitude and the situation and the law is still hot headed and he he actually
    ended up being drunk drunk and dying early so what the other guys they said well
    a good day they chose him because he was the most the most generous and the bond
    vivante and he was for every party and drinking every time and yeah one time Chikihut
    took the great judge who wrote the secret history Chikihut took was sleeping at
    a cart one time of for whatever reason I don't know what I think he also had passed
    out drunk perhaps but a good day came out drunk and grabbed him up and pulled
    him back into the party and a good day was a party guy and so he was chosen as
    the next great Han of the Mongol Empire but fortunately there was sort of a plan
    B and that Chikihut Han had set up very powerful women his daughters but also
    he had chosen wives for each of his son very very capable wives and for a good
    day he had a wife it wasn't even his first wife the first wife would usually be
    somebody closer by a certain clan or something but he had a very intelligent woman
    made dorshin and then she was more or less ruling in his last few years and then
    after he died she ruled empire in her own name she was the ruler of the greatest
    empire in world ever ruled by a woman it's incredible the genius of jangus to
    set it up that way yes and to not you know there's probably very widespread discrimination
    of women at that time and to have not care about any of that and just making the
    right decision for like what it will keep the empire together and dorshin was
    actually there was peace she stopped all campaigns there was peace during her
    time and the women like such as dorshin and those were extremely into economics
    and trade and running these they had these private corporations called orphalc
    she was running her orphalc and everything so she became much more interested
    in economics of the trade and running the empire and it was the time of peace
    and she recognized that peace was better for trade it was better and so it was
    a peaceful time but like all of us you know we we have our weak points and she
    favored a worthless son to become the successor and none of the sons actually
    were great but a good they had favored another but anyway she favored guilluc
    her son and so she arranged to have him made a great emperor while she was still
    alive and she had her primary minister was also a woman an infatima from the Middle
    East and unfortunately they organized a purge of her court and killed off a lot
    of these people who had been supporting her and a lot of them were Muslims and
    he killed off a lot and then he was going to march against the golden horde because
    they weren't supporting him so he set off and he died he was only in office for
    18 months and he was gone and then his wife took over okamish unfortunately she
    was not capable is her mother-in-law dorshin okamish was a bit greedy and she
    didn't start any new wars but she just kind of messed up things and she didn't
    rule for too long and this is why Kubla Khan's mother sorghtani was able to have
    a revolution she united with the golden horde she was on one end on china she
    had northern china the golden horde had russia the two of them united against
    the center and they overthrew ogalhamish and she put her son mongkhon in who was
    succeeded by hublaihan and we should say probably that you know this whole succession
    by kin probably goes against the initial spirit of what jangus constate for yes
    yes in the end he was a father and he favored his sons even knowing they were
    not so capable and he had lost the grand son that he loved but but he organized
    it though as what we take call today almost a corporation all lands belong to
    everybody in the family everybody so Kubla Khan that's why he had had soldiers
    there were christian soldiers osedi and soldiers and kipchek soldiers he had 10,000
    of each come in and then they owned the russians would own silk factories in china
    the ilkhanate would own silk factories and jade mines in china of the people in
    china the mongols they would own villages in Persia and in ira so he organized
    it all his everything was owned by the entire plan it didn't last too long like
    that because of the divisions that developed so the great han was primarily in
    charge of conquering and expanding the land so they had more lands to own that
    was going to be the job and Kubla Khan fulfilled it mongkhan to some six-cent
    fulfilled it a good day did guik did not his family ruling the land all the different
    territories yeah and they weakened with every generation yeah every generation
    but that reminds me of a a very popular idea about jangus Khan articulated in
    the 2003 paper titled the genetic legacy of the mongols so that paper has a finding
    that estimates that 0
  text: we should say that this is the the time of the summer I yeah Japan so so there
    was never a real test of like that no there was some fighting and the summer I
    learned some very valuable things the summer I had such a ritualized way of like
    the Knights of Europe coming out with armor that had to be lifted up on a crane
    onto a horse and I mean it was just craziness crazy to the summer right almost
    at that point you ride out in front of your enemy and you recite the story of
    your genealogy all right what you know Mongols they have no use for that are there
    there to fight they're there to win but on the other hand this was a unknown territory
    to them and the weather did turn against them but I don't want to give too much
    credit to weather I really think that the Japanese defeated them the Mongols weren't
    well prepared their ships were not very good they were defeated in the first invasion
    could they get off the ships onto the beach or they did they had some skirmishes
    or small battles on land yes they did but they didn't successfully complete them
    no no so they couldn't do their usual Mongol thing you're right well see they
    don't have enough horses for one thing yeah you know and uh there were many tactical
    things that they had done incorrectly it's the first time anybody had ever tried
    to have such a massive invasion yeah so they're just learning the basics of what
    it means to have a navy so he has failed to conquer and he's thinking like a Mongol
    that you rule the those waters and lands but he ruled the ocean he stopped the
    trade he stopped the supply he cut off the possibility of the Song Dynasty fleeing
    to Japan he won in a certain way he lost but he had won his objective of cutting
    off southern China also it gave him navy some experience with the ocean and now
    they were ready to move out into the ocean around southern China so they were
    closing in then Aju was in command but actually the head command was a man named
    Bayan who was a Mongol who had been raised more in Central Asia he was perhaps
    born close to the Fagana Valley in that area we're not exactly sure where he's
    born but he grew up over there and then he eventually was living in what's now
    Iran what he came and he took over command of the army he was very cosmopolitan
    sophisticated intelligent Aju should have been in command but Bayan recognized
    that and he and Aju worked together very well Aju knew how to fight the war Bayan
    was able to negotiate things back with the capital city and handle things so Bayan
    is in command and so the generals are deserting the south song right and left
    the artisans are all coming up to join the Mongols great-paid the generals are
    loading up the boats with all the jewels and they grab a couple of brothers to
    the little five-year-old emperor and they put them on a boat and they're fleeing
    they even deserted their own families the generals were corrupt cowards who fled
    the person left in charge was the Dowager Empress an old lady shout no children
    she was her name the Dowager Empress she they said she was missing an eye she
    was ugly they're a cullter ugly she that's what they called her at that time she
    was in charge and she offered the Mongols everything I'll give you everything
    please let the Empress stay okay even if you demote him to just being a king please
    let him stay Bayan said no total surrender total surrender so she decided to surrender
    well she said yes we will surrender the capital so Bayan came in with a small
    group of soldiers they looked around and she invited him to come to the palace
    to surrender and he said no I didn't win this war in the palace my soldiers won
    this war in the field you have to come with the emperor in front of my soldiers
    to surrender but he did not harm her he respected her and there was no looting
    of the city now later they take everything in a very systematic way they take
    the archives and all this kind of stuff away but there's no wholesale looting
    a killing of people nothing like that so they've taken the capital and she comes
    out she surrenders she bows on the ground towards Beijing and then she takes the
    child emperor and they slowly make their way she was a little bit sick it took
    her a longer time to Beijing and they surrender again in a public ceremony bowing
    to the Kubla Khan he gives each of them a palace he gives them a new new title
    he probably is trying to show the world this is the new face of Mongols we don't
    kill off the old people anymore who are really we're going to give them a palace
    treat them nicely and all but the navy that had fled did not defend the city those
    cowardly generals they made the new little boy seven-year-old brother half brother
    to to Emperor Gong was his name they made him the emperor well they're just floating
    around in the ocean losing all support from city after city the Muslims who were
    controlling the trade and controlling many of the ships of that area they were
    Chinese Muslims but they were still Muslims they switched sides to the Mongols
    because of the religious freedom thing and because they were merchants and their
    status would be raised so the the Muslims were switching over the fleet was kind
    of a fleet lost without a country out there they had some loyal supporters some
    places are they dropped the emperor into ocean what do you mean how do you drop
    the emperor into ocean they accidentally spilled him into ocean and then they
    fished him out but he died so fortunately they had one more seven-year-old half
    brother so on Lentao island exactly where the Hong Kong airport is today the new
    well it's not so new anymore but I still think it was the new airport on Lentao
    island so they went there and they had a big coronation ceremony and all but the
    people there were not supportive enough it certainly wasn't Hong Kong then anyway
    at the delta of the Pearl River so they they sailed out farther south to another
    island and then they took it over and of course the first thing they did was well
    we have to build a palace what the Mongols are chasing you and you can stop and
    build a palace so these are like the remains of the Chinese yes the generals and
    the generals army and the navy and there was a real competence issue yes okay
    so they're going to build a house we're going to protect it with a great wall
    of the sea they chained together the boats across the entrance to the harbor and
    they put a palace boat so called in the middle the generals didn't trust their
    own soldiers enough so they made all of them leave the island and go to the boats
    to fight the Mongols so Mongols arrived in over and over and over they asked them
    to surrender you won't be harmed all this kind of stuff and all and but the Mongols
    now took over the land so they had the water all around them and they had the
    land and once the fighting started they could just shoot down from the highland
    right onto the ships and they've cut the ships off from the fresh supply of of
    wood and water so they can't boil rice they have to try to eat rice and drink
    sea water they're all sick as dogs out there and the leaders refused to surrender
    the little boy is their seven-year-old emperor Bing was his name with his pet
    parrot that's the only thing he had left in life was his pet parrot and then the
    Mongols they offered every opportunity but the prime minister so called coward
    that he is although he's treated as a hero today in China and throughout their
    history but coward that he was he said we will not disgrace the country by letting
    them capture the emperor so first he threw his own wife and children into the
    water to drown and then he took the emperor and held him the seven-year-old he
    was seven years and one month he had just turned seven years old and jumped into
    the water with this child a child murderer he's a child murderer to do that somehow
    in the whole ruckus the cage came undone with the parrot and the parrot fell in
    the water too so the seven-year-old boy and the parrot died in the water that
    was the end of one of the greatest dynasties in the history of the world the song
    dynasty they were intellectually great they were artistically great they were
    technologically great they were just one of the greatest moments of world history
    and it ends with this coward killing a child and his pet parrot in order to save
    the honor that was betrayed by this woman the men lost the war the men lost the
    war who's to blame an old one-eyed ugly lady imprisciate well the bigger picture
    there is probably is it's become the institutions became corrupt and stale and
    the the army weakened and the politician the politician class probably have have
    lost their skill and competence at ruling and all that kind of stuff and all that
    is true and the and the Chinese summarized that with losing the mandate of heaven
    right i mean everybody has their perspective maybe if uh the way you told the
    story has a very kind of objective sort of way of revealing the absurdity and
    the cowardice of it but you know this probably the Chinese perspectives that they
    tell the story in some kind like maintained honor to the last yes to the last
    moment they very often most scholars depict impriscio as the traitor to the country
    and i say no that boy lived on for another 45 years and so she did not betray
    the country she protected or emperor that she was supposed to protect it was the
    man who killed the child emperor who killed young bing so what was the lasting
    impact of Kublai Kahn unifying China well yes first of all he had unified China
    in the largest sense of the word with Korea to bet manchuria Mongolia part of
    central Asia he had unified it but he did so at the expense of his empire they
    didn't recognize him as the great emperor and there was a great opposition from
    the golden horde of russia and also from the the central region which is called
    the the chagatayid the descendants of sagade the second son the chagatay empire
    and then from the ilkaneit of Persia these are the different sort of fracturings
    of the Mongolian sons of jingus kahn yeah and only the ilkaneit was still loyal
    to him but they're so far away yeah but now he has a navy but this is i mean even
    the four pieces the whole thing is gigantic and even the pieces of gigantic so
    i mean it's very hard to keep an empire of this size together yes but he had china
    it was unified under him and then he he sent out the first expedition to sail
    directly to persia there had been trade all throughout thousands of years but
    i was usually port to port you know different merchants shading goods no he organized
    a great fleet to send a queen our princess to become queen in the ilkaneit to
    marry the the ilkane of persia it's persia and as are by john and armenia and
    rack and part of syria all of that area so he said organized this and it so happened
    that marco polo was ready to go home because they knew kubelicon was about to
    die and in fact he only had about one year left to live and they wanted to get
    their riches out before they didn't know what's going to happen this is a new
    dynasty they've been in total control of china for one generation and they didn't
    know what was going to happen and also just before that there'd been a bad time
    because kubelicon had tried to invade japan a second time and he had failed a
    second time and the second time i think again he had a practical purpose and net
    was he had this whole huge song army that now he's the new enlightened mongol
    who doesn't slaughter so he's got what is he going to do they're not reliable
    they're not safe so he sends a bunch of them up into the almuha river of what's
    down the russian far east or we call Siberian English but the russian far east
    almuha river he sent expeditions up into to bet exploring options up there but
    there wasn't enough room or enough agricultural area for huge military colony
    but most of his ships were loaded with former prisoners of the war from the song
    dynasty and they were not armed they had hos and implements for farming he wanted
    to create obviously an agricultural military agricultural farm in japan to help
    feed northern china because it was very important just as they were doing with
    the almuha river but it was more complicated so again they lost they didn't have
    it and part of it reason is the the exposition was massive and they organized
    it in the mongol principles of left wing right wing this didn't work at sea because
    the left wing is from korea there's korean ships built up there the right wing
    is from southern china mostly with ships built down there they're not the same
    they have a head but there's no center point jingus Khan always had the goal they
    called it gul the goal the center or or qoel actually all by did he had the center
    in command no he sent the two without a clear and they were arguing with each
    other not cooperating not helping each other sabotaging each other they get there
    once again they have the same problems even though they've come with lots of grenades
    this time again the grenades are exploding they're they're scaring the horses
    you know it's impressive and a lot of silk screens are made later showing these
    impressive battles and all but they're lost and again a typhoon happened to be
    the final the final destruction of the navy but i think it's japan had defeated
    the mongols i would say japanese deserve credit for that victory and then the
    the thinking of the ships was more caused by the by the typhoon but already the
    japanese had developed good strategies while the mongols have been away they knew
    how the mongols fought and they knew that at night they could fire flaming arrows
    at the ships set them on fire and they were doing great damage so again kublakhan
    lost the invasion of japan but the soldiers were gone they drowned he didn't kill
    them off was his deliberate plan but the problem was solved it's one of those
    ironies of history that is harder quite understand so this had happened but then
    kublakhan was coming to the near the end of life and marco polo and those wanted
    to get out they're ready to go and kublakhan allowed them to sail on this expedition
    with hukshin was her name the princess hukshin to go to a hormous and so they
    went and that began a whole system of trade back and forth back and forth kublakhan
    died soon after that his grandson who's not so well respected in history because
    he's often called a drunk but his name was tumur tumur and jetu but he was a drunk
    when he was young but his grandfather had him cained a couple times in public
    and he cured him of drinking and actually he was not a drunk later on and he was
    first he knew reassembled the mongol empire he did the golden horde declared loyalty
    to him recognize him as great hon is emperor of the whole empire the chagatahi
    de central aja they declared loyalty to him the ill Khanate was already loyal
    to him they all declared loyalty he had reassembled the empire and he had the
    greatest navy in the world and he sent out on voice to every place they had attacked
    or traded with to say that era is over we're no longer attacking anybody we're
    changing from conquest to commerce we want to trade with you come to china bring
    your goods we're going to trade with you he instituted it was short unfortunately
    didn't last forever i wish it could have but it was a great era of the exchange
    of all kinds of things going back and forth all the way actually all the way to
    Africa kosram or mous they had connection to somale land and some people say can
    you already at that time i'm not sure but very wide very wide so technically he
    ruled over the the largest size the mongol empire ever had yes but although actually
    the golden horde of russia they were quite independent by now and he let them
    be independent but they were loyal to him and they were still exchanging back
    and forth all kinds of things so there were osetian soldiers in china that had
    a whole contingent of osetian soldiers there and from russia from the caucus areas
    of russia and how do they communicate are they using like the postal service they
    have to you have to literally deliver the letters no over time those groups started
    intermarrying with they were allowed to enter married the chinese were not but
    they were intermarrying with mongols and they were switching to mongolian language
    slowly at first i don't know it's not clear but again Kubla Khan thinking in this
    internationalist way said okay we need a new alphabet for the world everybody
    in the world right with one alphabet chinese mongolian russian arabic everything
    it didn't work but he tried it for a while and some inscriptions are still there
    to this day and we should maybe briefly mention markupo that you've talked about
    so he is this now famous explorer that traversed the continent does so crowed
    and then stayed with Kubla Khan for a while and i guess one is one of the primary
    documenters of everything that's been going on is there something else interesting
    to say about about markupo and about his interaction with Kubla Khan i like markupo
    though i use i use his work a lot i find him very reliable in the areas where
    he's not reliable you can kind of tell because he didn't he wasn't there but the
    places he was he reported a lot of stuff and so i'm very much indebted to him
    for a lot of things because with something like the princess hukjin and also another
    fighting princess from central azure named hutulum he wrote about that but i also
    needed other sources so i found if i could find chinese sources or arab sources
    or something else or person to support it then i really felt a lot of confidence
    with him over time but pieces were romanticized and you have to always discount
    it but is very good however i believe the best work written about markupo as i
    from his own book which was actually written by rista cello dictated in prison
    in jenua you know in the 20th century ujino nio wrote a play that became a comedy
    on broadway called marko millions that was both a play on what he was called el
    milioni the million one because he had talked about cities of millions of people
    and about money in the millions and things that people in europe just couldn't
    believe could happen he then published his whole play as a book to show people
    what he really meant and it was an ironic look at capitalism because this is 20th
    century already versus the idea of like a philosopher king which he saw in kublecon
    it's oh markupolo becomes a symbol of capitalism not at its worst but at its most
    basic and that is like the princess in this story this is not in real life but
    this is in the play written by ujino nio by i think it captures a lot the princess
    hukshin says marko is an excellent judge of quantity and there are things like
    that and then in the play bion the great general it talks with kublecon and he
    said look these people are dangerous from the west we should go conquer them now
    while we can kublecon tells bion again in the play this is fiction but it tells
    bion they are not worth conquering and if we conquer them we will become like
    them and he said marko polo has been in our land he has seen everything he has
    learned nothing he has seen everything he understands nothing for me this was
    such an important moment in the history of the world symbolically with marko polo
    and kublecon the coming together of two worlds it could have gone a different
    way could have gone a different way and i am it's not that i'm anti-capitalist
    i'm pro-capitalist but the way so many things worked out it was a misstep in history
    maybe we took the wrong step at that moment and we could have learned more from
    cooperation they didn't quite integrate successfully no but today we've returned
    to that i think the east and the west are confronting each other again on more
    equal terms for a long time the west was so dominant and the east was so downtrodden
    by colonialism and other things an internal rot and other things but today there's
    none is there equality but there's more of a balance and which way will we go
    and again there's a lot of room and a lot of energy for division for misunderstanding
    versus integration like the the east is demonized in the west and one of the great
    regrets i have that i hope to alleviate is just how little i understand china
    in the east it's just sort of not not just from kind of economics politics you
    know reading a few books but like the way you've understood and felt them ongoing
    step like understand the chinese people in that way because it does feel like
    from that understanding there could be integration of ideas you know my work is
    often classified as chinese history which i think is ironic because for me it's
    always a mongolian history but for the last book i wrote which dealt a lot more
    with china because it was about kubla Khan then in that book i deliberately did
    not go to china i'd been there numerous times before i deliberately did not i'm
    an outsider i do not speak chinese i'm not a chinese scholar i never even had
    a course in chinese art or calligraphy or anything and i wanted to be very clear
    mine is an outside perspective but i think it's possible as an outsider to still
    have respect for that culture even if i disagree that they point this one as a
    hero and that one's as devilent i disagree and they'll say all i'm wrong i don't
    understand their history and they're probably right that's quite possible but
    this is an outside view that is different and tries to be respectful of what happens
    in that part of the world just as i'm respectful towards chinghoshan and the mongol
    empire i respect china very much i'm an american i love the ideals of my country
    i love so many aspects of our culture and there are many aspects i don't of course
    because it's impossible to love everything even about the members of your own
    family you know and i do hope that through understanding one another are just
    making the effort to understand even if we understand wrongly and we're incorrect
    in it just to make the effort to understand will help us a lot and the west has
    had a long couple of centuries of extreme arrogance that they are there to teach
    the world and i sometimes this made i meet these young people all over the world
    who have come to help they're an NGO and they're going to teach the people how
    to take care of the environment they're going to teach the women how to exercise
    their rights they're going to bring in micro financing to help liberate people
    we are arrogant beyond words and we need to be a little bit more humble and try
    to put ourselves on an equal basis where some of these people not as a period
    basis beautifully put how did the mongol empire come to an end how did it fall
    despite the fact that tumultal jittuhan had united the empire at least symbolically
    all of it and they had the trade going on the mongols never adapted well to china
    and they began having problems in different areas so in some areas of the world
    they became more like the local people so in central Asia they became Muslim and
    they got more absorbed into that world and broke from the mongol examples from
    before russia lingered on longer under mongol domination but it got weaker and
    weaker over time and it was based around the vulgar river but the week until the
    point that they just became a tributary people minority within a russian empire
    but the mongols had left as the framework for empire for russia that's something
    russians don't want to hear any more they want to hear me criticize the end of
    the song dynasty but it is true that even yam yam is the word that was used for
    this postal system and that's the ministries today and russia and there many many
    other things or in russia so even malchik malchin is a herder mal is a person
    is a animal and chin is a person a person takes care of animals you know it's
    all kinds of influences in russia that some people wanted to die but there's always
    a great powerful strand of research and scholarship in russia that supports this
    understanding of the mongols and I depend on them tremendously it's not just a
    gumballjolf is one of the famous ones but he was a little bit too romantic with
    his ideas and all but I depend upon a lot of the research and done by russian
    scholars and by early german scholars in the 19th century under sponsorship of
    the tar so I depend on that work so you had a great influence there but it was
    weakening so bit by bit 1368 the mongols have become so weak within china that
    they were overthrown but they weren't absorbed into china but the mongols have
    been there since 1215 to 1368 they packed up went back to mongolia it was just
    another seasonal migration yeah you know it was just amazing and they said okay
    we're still the uand dynasty we're not giving you the seals we're not acknowledging
    the ming and they'd ever did throughout the whole of the ming in fact they went
    down one time and captured the main emperor taking back the mongolia and then
    they tried to ransom him and the Chinese said no we're going to point to another
    emperor so the mongols decided okay the worst thing we can do to the chinese is
    give them back the old emperor so you had two emperors you know back okay let
    them work it out you know and the empire just weakened from internal reasons for
    the mongols but some external things from nature and i think that was the great
    plague you know everything in history everything that's good comes with something
    underneath that that's bad and everything this bad seems to have something underneath
    that sometimes works out good anyway but this great system that united it's called
    the yam or or to that united everything people could move back and forth quickly
    then it could also take the plague out of southern china into all parts of the
    world and i do think that's what happened and the plague destroyed the mongol
    system and if all of these people are ruled by mongols because they're benefiting
    so much from this system and now the system collapses yeah you don't need the
    empire anymore yeah so it just fell apart after 1368 the empire just fell apart
    and most of them stayed stayed in Persia and Iran and Afghanistan the hazara people
    are still descended from the army there and then in russia some of them stayed
    but then finally in the time of catholic great a lot of them were returned little
    pair they had been there for hundreds of years and then they returned to mongolia
    in the 1700s and so many mongols came home they were still mongols despite hundreds
    of years of exposure to other cultures they came back to their tent and squatting
    around the fire and drinking fermented milk and eating dried curds it's interesting
    that the the mongolian spirit is so strong that it persists yes through centuries
    yes i think it's just return right back on the horse riding in the open step yeah
    well it was actually very difficult because they were a little bit lazy and they
    weren't so good with doing the task and so it became difficult actually to support
    so many people coming home and eating up all the animals the mongols in china
    had been used to just eating they hadn't been producing much for 150 years so
    just a return to jengus con we talked about dan karlan and dan karlan said that
    jengus con's army was the greatest military force in history and many other historians
    agree that before rifles came into popular use jengus con would basically beat
    every single army including napolian and you mentioned the summarize the whole
    formal setup same with napolian there's just there's a whole you know like you
    know several hours to set up the chess pieces on the military board i mean you
    can just imagine what jengus con and the the the dynamism the the speed of everything
    what that would do to napolian so i guess the question is where do you agree with
    that notion that jengus con's army is the greatest military force in history so
    it answers yes absolutely no other power in the history of the world has conquered
    russia and china and perja and central aja and terky and korea no power in the
    world has done that not Alexander not the Romans nobody will ever do it again
    nobody's going to conquer china and russia again and rule both countries it's
    just not going to happen what lessons i mean can you take from that's applicable
    to modern warfare oh i think there's a very good lesson and the mongols took a
    rack they took back that they held it the americans we followed the exact opposite
    strategy of the mongols mongol strategy is first you take the countryside their
    country people they think in terms of countryside you take the countryside you
    occupy the countryside and you cut off the city it cannot live without the countryside
    and that's how they did it every time they would come in as i say in some cases
    two two years in advance to clear people out so they would have room for their
    horses and have pasture for their horses and all and you take the small towns
    and in the small cities and then the last one is the big city americans they said
    no we're going to take Baghdad we're going to bomb Baghdad we're going to have
    this shock and awe we're going to go in we conquer the country from Baghdad so
    they go in they get trapped in their little tiny green zone they never conquer
    a rack the strongest army in the world you know this is something that worked
    in europe world war two yes we bombed the cities and we took the city because
    that was the city the center of production for the modern era but the countryside
    is the place that produces the food the mongols were very aware of that and supplies
    the water you cut off the water from the city you cut off the food for the city
    what's the city going to do they're going to surrender the americans were applying
    something that worked in western europe to conquer Germany it did not work to
    conquer a rack or vietnam or even northern korea or cambodia or laos or syria
    or god no it worked only in grenade i think that's the only in my lifetime that's
    the only successful war we had lasted a couple of hours we went in conquered the
    little tiny island otherwise we've been chased out of every country we've lost
    it tail between our legs we dropped more bombs on cambodia than we dropped on
    germany it's hard to believe hard to believe we dropped more bombs on cambodia
    than on germany we did nothing because germany you destroy the cities the people
    surrender terrestrial is gone frankford fritzburg berlin uh in cambodia you can
    bomb the countryside forever you can kill the people and they did you can use
    chemical warfare and they did and you could still go into the eastern part of
    cambodia and you could go to a large areas where you don't hear birds singing
    because of the chemical warfare and the merit of american bombs so we still do
    it but we don't want to admit it and we don't want to go into win when world war
    two the americans did have unconditional surrender well i mean you could support
    the war not support the war we did it right we did it wrong these are all issues
    that people can argue but we had a clear policy we go into afghanistan we're fighting
    terror we're going to bring democracy we're going to free the women what i mean
    it's an absolute sheer insanity the things that we did and we kill people not
    only did we use chemical warfare and kill a lot of people in vietnam and laos
    and and cambodia we killed american soldiers we killed american soldiers and my
    father was one he died from agent orange disease oh but that doesn't count he
    didn't die on the battlefield and we didn't mean to kill him it doesn't count
    modern warfare is brutal and we just paper over it sometimes you know can you
    explain agent orange it was designed to kill all vegetation this is going to be
    a humane way we're going to kill all the vegetation in the jungle and that way
    they can stop moving the army through the jungle and they can stop the supplies
    from coming that was american strategy yeah henry kissinger no bell price winner
    he is now resting in hell is exactly where he belongs for what he did to Vietnam
    laos and cambodia the bombing was just absolutely horrendous so agent orange comes
    in they defoliated which means they wiped out the crop so people are starving
    literally in the case of cambodia starving to death the animals are being killed
    and deformed children are being born to this day and american soldiers died by
    the thousands not immediately not on the not on the battlefield not right there
    they go home they have the disease they linger they take the whole family down
    with them in an emotional trauma of becoming slowly paralyzed and dying we did
    that to our own people so yeah warfare i don't think we're any more humane with
    it any better today than in the past it's just we can hide parts of it more easily
    and deny it more easily if you're killed by a mongol it's very clear you're killed
    by a mongol you're killed by friendly fire in american war so different matter
    it seems that what people mean when they say that war is hell that's in some deep
    sense everybody loses no matter the narrative you put on top of it yes yes i'm
    not a pacifist again but i think war is acceptable in some situations but the
    more controlled it is the better my my effort is not to do away with all the things
    that happened under Chinggis Han with the brutality and all like that but it's
    to measure it against what goes on today in the world today and we have the different
    images there are two images of Chinggis Han one is our image he's a barbarian
    on a horseback killing people and raping women all the time the other image is
    the Mongolian image and when they finally built an official statue of him in that
    in this century for the 800th anniversary of his founding of Mongolia that to
    think about how to present him to the world and to themselves and they chose the
    link and memorial as the model he was the late great log river of the Mongol nation
    and so he's seated there in front of the Mongolian parliament there's another
    statue that's better known but it was a private enterprise that created him on
    a horseback but not with a weapon but he's on horseback out in the countryside
    but the official one for the government is Chinggis Han seated like Abraham Lincoln
    and they issued stamps to show that he is the great log giver and the truth is
    somewhere in between well they are depending on where you are and how you want
    to see it you know there are many things that happen that were terrible and horrible
    and for people who lose a war it's going to always be terrible and horrible yeah
    let's return back to Chinggis Han's life and the end of it how and where did he
    die after conquering the Horaism empire in central Asia Chinggis Han returned
    and then they had a great what they called not him a great celebration that went
    on for a whole summer just about it they had so much wealth to distribute to everybody
    and everybody is being given all kinds of things you know for what they have done
    and including the people who helped save him when he was in the in the kank and
    the in the ox yolk they were rewarded with everybody was rewarded it was a great
    time but the first place he had attacked outside was the Tanguit nation and they
    had sworn allegiance to him and then when he went off to the middle east they
    refused to send troops he didn't forget that he's going back to the Tanguit nation
    and he's going to conquer them again as he was crossing the goby which takes a
    while and you're crossing the goby he was distracted a little bit by hunting the
    hulawn which is the wild we say the wild ass or I used to say wild horse it sounds
    a little better but the hulawn to say hulawn of the goby he was off hunting hulawn
    he fell from his horse and he injured his leg very badly and he seemed to decline
    from that point and it took some number of months before August of 1227 he was
    very much near the end of life you can read online the exact date and it's all
    very specific but the truth is we don't know exactly which day he died in that
    time because he's one of his wives wise running the camp and they were keeping
    it secret until the defeat of the Tanguit was completed and the Tanguit offered
    all kinds of things to for the Mongols to go away again the second time and Chinggis
    Han had told his family no except nothing and then when they surrender you kill
    the royal family kill them all so that the idea they were they were Buddhist people
    the Tanguits were Buddhist and the idea was usually you can be reborn into your
    own family but he said no you kill off the whole family so they can't be reborn
    so he died there how is he successor chosen oh the succession issue was always
    difficult he did not have the right to appoint a successor that was not de mongo
    way he can nominate somebody so before he set off for the Middle Eastern campaign
    one of his wives said to him you know even the biggest tree falls you've got to
    make a plan and talk to your sons about the future so he did he called the sons
    together so this is zooch the oldest boy who is born while the father was allied
    with his anda jamauk and he was named visitor zooch and then the next one was
    chagaday and the next one was a good day and the next one was tole the father
    of of Kubla Khan but he was still alive at this point so all four of them came
    so chinghaskan explained to them he wanted to talk about the succession and to
    get some consensus from them about the succession and so he said the mongols always
    call on people to speak by order of age they also serve tea or food anything by
    order of age it's always done that way from then till now so he called first on
    zooch and he said what do you say zooch chinghaskan favored zooch this is the
    one who was christianal paternity but he always favored him you know the youngest
    tiller was too hot headed a good day was a heavy drinker chagaday was very rigid
    about the law of the mongols and all you know but he thought he seemed to favor
    zooch as a more reasonable good warrior but reasonable person but he called on
    zooch my son speak chagaday the second one who believes in mongolaw supposedly
    he jumped up and he said this is when he accused his father of all kinds of he
    said how can you call on this mongol this market bastard if you call on him first
    that means you want him to be the great Khan he should not be the great Khan of
    the mongol empire is this mongol empire now on and you know you can imagine kind
    of seen well chinkus han is the greatest ruler in the world he's sitting there
    being lectured by his second son and this is when he gave that impassioned speech
    to his now in the actually the way the secret history it makes it look like it
    was his assistant speaker who said it because very often the great power doesn't
    say the words directly they let somebody else say them form have a spokesperson
    but anyway I think it was his words and I think he said them on that day that's
    what I think on this business of you do not know you were not there you know the
    stars were moving in the sky the head was head was turning around the earth was
    turning over you do not know who loved who you do not know who your mother loved
    you do not know what your mother did and if I say he is my son who are you to
    say he is not my son by the way pretty just really high integrity really respectable
    to do that to have that respect and honor his wife in this way yes and the son
    in this way it's really powerful I believe that I don't know if she was alive
    at this point or not we do not have the death recorded mongols are not good at
    recording death they don't they usually just say somebody finished their age or
    they have some euphemism for it but he made that in passion speech and so God
    they had to submit and he said yes you are our father and we accept what you say
    but a dear shot with words cannot be loaded on a horse a dear shot with words
    cannot be eaten so sing us Han knew so he said to the boys the boys I mean these
    middle age men they're not boys but he said to the men what do you want to do
    what do you want to do and he said I don't favor it's like I day because of his
    attitude and the situation and the law is still hot headed and he he actually
    ended up being drunk drunk and dying early so what the other guys they said well
    a good day they chose him because he was the most the most generous and the bond
    vivante and he was for every party and drinking every time and yeah one time Chikihut
    took the great judge who wrote the secret history Chikihut took was sleeping at
    a cart one time of for whatever reason I don't know what I think he also had passed
    out drunk perhaps but a good day came out drunk and grabbed him up and pulled
    him back into the party and a good day was a party guy and so he was chosen as
    the next great Han of the Mongol Empire but fortunately there was sort of a plan
    B and that Chikihut Han had set up very powerful women his daughters but also
    he had chosen wives for each of his son very very capable wives and for a good
    day he had a wife it wasn't even his first wife the first wife would usually be
    somebody closer by a certain clan or something but he had a very intelligent woman
    made dorshin and then she was more or less ruling in his last few years and then
    after he died she ruled empire in her own name she was the ruler of the greatest
    empire in world ever ruled by a woman it's incredible the genius of jangus to
    set it up that way yes and to not you know there's probably very widespread discrimination
    of women at that time and to have not care about any of that and just making the
    right decision for like what it will keep the empire together and dorshin was
    actually there was peace she stopped all campaigns there was peace during her
    time and the women like such as dorshin and those were extremely into economics
    and trade and running these they had these private corporations called orphalc
    she was running her orphalc and everything so she became much more interested
    in economics of the trade and running the empire and it was the time of peace
    and she recognized that peace was better for trade it was better and so it was
    a peaceful time but like all of us you know we we have our weak points and she
    favored a worthless son to become the successor and none of the sons actually
    were great but a good they had favored another but anyway she favored guilluc
    her son and so she arranged to have him made a great emperor while she was still
    alive and she had her primary minister was also a woman an infatima from the Middle
    East and unfortunately they organized a purge of her court and killed off a lot
    of these people who had been supporting her and a lot of them were Muslims and
    he killed off a lot and then he was going to march against the golden horde because
    they weren't supporting him so he set off and he died he was only in office for
    18 months and he was gone and then his wife took over okamish unfortunately she
    was not capable is her mother-in-law dorshin okamish was a bit greedy and she
    didn't start any new wars but she just kind of messed up things and she didn't
    rule for too long and this is why Kubla Khan's mother sorghtani was able to have
    a revolution she united with the golden horde she was on one end on china she
    had northern china the golden horde had russia the two of them united against
    the center and they overthrew ogalhamish and she put her son mongkhon in who was
    succeeded by hublaihan and we should say probably that you know this whole succession
    by kin probably goes against the initial spirit of what jangus constate for yes
    yes in the end he was a father and he favored his sons even knowing they were
    not so capable and he had lost the grand son that he loved but but he organized
    it though as what we take call today almost a corporation all lands belong to
    everybody in the family everybody so Kubla Khan that's why he had had soldiers
    there were christian soldiers osedi and soldiers and kipchek soldiers he had 10,000
    of each come in and then they owned the russians would own silk factories in china
    the ilkhanate would own silk factories and jade mines in china of the people in
    china the mongols they would own villages in Persia and in ira so he organized
    it all his everything was owned by the entire plan it didn't last too long like
    that because of the divisions that developed so the great han was primarily in
    charge of conquering and expanding the land so they had more lands to own that
    was going to be the job and Kubla Khan fulfilled it mongkhan to some six-cent
    fulfilled it a good day did guik did not his family ruling the land all the different
    territories yeah and they weakened with every generation yeah every generation
    but that reminds me of a a very popular idea about jangus Khan articulated in
    the 2003 paper titled the genetic legacy of the mongols so that paper has a finding
    that estimates that 0.
  type: recommendation
- actionable: true
  confidence: medium
  extracted: have things that unite all people everybody should have their own law
    but there should be a higher law of heaven the governs people you know and this
    later was translated everybody should have their own language but they all write
    the same alphabet by Kublaqan it did work or his idea he tried to impose the use
    of paper currency in Iran the person Il Khanate a Chinese paper money it didn't
    work the people there weren't used to do so they're but all this international
    spirit of their empire I think that we need today we talk about all globalization
    we're all connected it's just incredible and we're more provincial than ever we
    are just so provincial and and sometimes we use all this technology to help preserve
    our provincialism and we can't think in global terms we can't think about the
    world it's just amazing to me how narrow-minded we are I also saw the Mongol proverb
    of if you're afraid don't do it if you do it don't be afraid yes they you especially
    celebrate I mean there is something to that this in many ways in jeng's Khan is
    a representation of a of a person like a self-made man that person from nothing
    yes willed an entire empire into existence yes and everything against him that
    you can think of your own family deserting you your father dying at an early age
    all these things like that but as jammokha said he had a good mother and he had
    a good wife and there were many crucial points at which it was either his mother
    or his wife who made the deciding point his wife first of was the one who caused
    the first break with a jammokha to go away later on when the shamans had become
    too powerful and they had humiliated his younger brother she was the one who said
    he had to clamp down on the shamans who were exercising too much power and she
    guided him a lot it cannot be understood how important critical women are in the
    story of the Mongol empire as fast as it's sometimes you know we can say they're
    not behind the scenes because they're always out front in the Mongol court they
    always set up front they're always out front in this this horrified the Chinese
    who are very good confused it horrified the Muslims it horrified the Christians
    who they didn't know what they said the women even drink in public okay yeah they
    drink in public you know they do what with so sometimes it was like that but other
    times as with dorogen she's actually the ruler or are the case of his daughters
    such as um alaqaibeq who ruled over a part of northern shayah called the ongoot
    people and the other daughters who ruled over different they ruled in their own
    names and he's he's very ex this is something about the secret history that upset
    me I get to chapter that all the sections are numbered I get to chapter or number
    or section 215 and there's only half a sentence left and 214 he's just awarded
    a girl he calls his daughter so she's probably a cliente or but she lives with
    his mother at this point his youngest son to low is only four years old a tatar
    comes and a mother urlun gives him food because you food everybody he realizes
    this is the mother of Chinggis Khan and that's the child of Chinggis Khan he grabs
    him up and kidnaps him and runs out and he's holding the child in one hand and
    he's pulling out a knife with another hand al-tani raced out and she grabbed his
    arm and held it down and two men jib and jil they were back behind the gear slaughtering
    an ox with an axe because you have to do it in the shade behind the gear that's
    you don't do it in the light and so they were back there doing that and so they
    raced out with the axe and they killed the man and so then Chinggis Khan was rewarding
    everybody for all their great deeds and jilman and jib they wanted to be rewarded
    for saving the life of talo you said no you killed the tatar al-tani saved his
    life because she held a hand that had the the knife until you got there to kill
    him she saved it and now we reward her so he's finished that story in 214 we get
    to 215 he says now let us reward our daughters it's actually only a phrase of
    that's I said is a complete sentence but I start quite complete the rest is gone
    cut out it's missing and I was just so and I looked at all these different translations
    of how to different language and most often they translated as and now let us
    marry our daughters oh no oh no he was very clear in his wedding speeches to his
    daughters I give these people to you to rule you have three husbands you have
    your honor you have your nation and you have the man that I give to you but the
    man I give to you goes in the army with me and brings his soldiers genius they
    hear and rule the people brilliant the Chinese when they arrived in the court
    of al-tani they didn't know what to think there she is ruling this area the ungood
    people and they said well she could read and write and she's a supreme judge and
    she doesn't allow any death sentence without her permission and uh but they didn't
    say which language is she could read and write that is really puzzled me a lot
    so you're saying the secret history as we have gotten access to has been edited
    to to remove the significance of women even though they're still there in that
    case I mean other cases with his mother they did not and all but I think in that
    case because what happened is most of these women had few offsprings because their
    husband was gone to war and al-tani of course she married several times sometimes
    all the sons of the last one you know but they were going off the war and they
    weren't reproducing their only one Sechsekut who was ruling in Siberia uh she
    was the one who had a whole bunch of daughters they wouldn't be going off the
    war and so they actually spread out through the Empire and did a lot of a lot
    of power later but what happened was the area for for al-t uh al-ikaibek for example
    was then taken over by Kublikon
  text: we should have things that unite all people everybody should have their own

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #476 – Jack Weatherford: Genghis Khan and the
  Mongol Empire


  This 279-minute episode features an in-depth conversation between the host and **Jack
  Weatherford**, a renowned anthropologist and historian specializing in Genghis Khan
  and the Mongol Empire, author of *Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World*.
  The discussion focuses heavily on the formative, brutal childhood of Temüjin (the
  future Genghis Khan) and how these early experiences shaped the creation of the
  largest contiguous land empire in history.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Historical Anthropology and Military/Social Organization**,
  specifically examining the life, context, and legacy of **Genghis Khan and the Mongol
  Empire**. Key themes include the harsh realities of the Mongolian steppe, the role
  of kinship and betrayal, the origins of Mongol law and governance, and the social
  structures (including the status of women) that underpinned their rapid expansion.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Weaponization of Environment/Objects:** Early in his captivity, Temüjin escaped
  a yoke (kank) by using the device itself as a weapon against his guard, illustrating
  an early Mongol tactical principle: **"If it moves, it''s a weapon."** This highlights
  a pragmatic, opportunistic approach to warfare and survival.

  *   **The Importance of the Cart (Ger Ownership):** The episode details that in
  Mongol society, women owned the *gers* (tents) and the carts used to move them.
  This established a fundamental division of labor and property rights, where the
  movement of the household was dictated by the women.

  *   **Foundation of Mongol Law (Yassa):** Weatherford links Genghis Khan’s later
  legal reforms directly to his personal trauma. His decision to outlaw the kidnapping
  and sale of women stemmed from the repeated betrayal and abandonment suffered by
  his mother, Börte, and later, the kidnapping of his wife, Börte.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  While not a direct financial discussion, the historical context offers strategic
  parallels:

  *   **Leveraging Disruption for Consolidation:** Genghis Khan’s rise demonstrates
  how extreme environmental and social disruption (the collapse of his family unit)
  can forge unparalleled leadership capable of imposing new, unifying structures (the
  Empire) over fractured entities.

  *   **Risk Management through Systemic Change:** His later outlawing of endemic
  raiding and kidnapping was a strategic move to reduce internal friction and resource
  drain, stabilizing the base of the empire before external expansion. This mirrors
  modern corporate strategy of eliminating internal inefficiencies.

  *   **Importance of Global Macro Context:** The sponsor mention of **A Leo Capital**
  frames the discussion within the necessity of understanding complex, shifting global
  macroeconomic systems to make sound investment decisions—a parallel to the complex,
  shifting tribal politics the Mongols navigated.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jack Weatherford:** The expert guest, providing deep historical context.

  *   **Temüjin (Genghis Khan):** The central figure, whose early life (abandonment,
  kidnapping, poverty) is meticulously detailed.

  *   **Erülün (Temüjin’s Mother):** Portrayed as the resilient core of the family,
  who single-handedly saved her children by digging for roots during starvation.

  *   **Börte (Temüjin’s Wife):** Her kidnapping at age 17 was the pivotal event that
  solidified Temüjin’s resolve and later influenced his legal framework.

  *   **Sponsors Mentioned:** A Leo Capital (AI/Macro Investing), ZockDock (Healthcare
  access), Fen (AI Customer Service), Oracle (Cloud Infrastructure/AI scaling), Shopify
  (E-commerce platform), Masterclass (Education), Element (Electrolytes).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion heavily covers the **creation of Mongol policy**. Genghis Khan’s
  later legal code was a direct response to the chaos of the steppe:

  *   **Outlawing Kidnapping/Sale of Women:** A direct response to his mother’s and
  wife’s experiences, aiming to reduce internal conflict driven by sexual competition
  and property disputes.

  *   **Challenging Kinship:** Temüjin’s early life proved that traditional Mongol
  reliance on blood kinship was unreliable, leading him to build an empire based on
  merit and loyalty to *him* rather than inherited tribal ties.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation underscores that foundational trauma and environmental pressure
  are powerful catalysts for radical innovation in governance and social structure.
  The Mongol Empire’s success lay in its ability to create a unified, meritocratic
  system that transcended the traditional, often destructive, tribal loyalties of
  the steppe.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Historians, Anthropologists, Strategists, Leaders,
  and anyone interested in the deep origins of statecraft, military organization,
  and leadership forged under extreme duress.**


  ---


  ### Comprehensive Summary


  This extensive conversation with Jack Weatherford dives deep into the crucible that
  forged Genghis Khan, arguing that his entire life and subsequent empire were defined
  by the traumatic events preceding his birth and during his childhood. The narrative
  arc begins with the dramatic, near-criminal kidnapping of his mother, **Erülün**,
  by his father, Yesügei, setting a precedent of violence and fractured kinship. Temüjin
  was named after a man his father killed, and his early life was marked by repeated
  abandonment: being left behind by his parents, being separated from his father,
  and ultimately, his father’s poisoning.


  The discussion emphasizes the **brutality of the Mongolian steppe**, where raiding
  for resources (especially women and trade goods) was endemic. Temüjin’s experience
  was uniquely harsh; after his father’s death, his mother'
