summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #1562 Jordi Visser | Short Squeeze Incoming?
  Bitcoin, Iran, and the Global Power Crisis


  This episode of the Pom Podcast features Anthony Pompliano in conversation with
  Jordi Visser, focusing on the immediate market reaction to the Israel-Iran geopolitical
  tensions, the structural implications of the AI energy demand, and the shifting
  macroeconomic landscape, particularly concerning inflation and potential Fed rate
  cuts.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centered on **Geopolitics and Macroeconomics impacting Asset Allocation**,
  with significant emphasis on:

  *   The immediate market fallout (Gold, Oil, Bitcoin) from the Israel-Iran conflict.

  *   The structural, long-term investment theme of **Energy/Power demand driven by
  Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

  *   Analysis of recent weak US inflation data and its implications for Federal Reserve
  policy (rate cuts).

  *   The evolving US-China trade relationship, framed as a necessary "separation"
  rather than outright conflict.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **AI Power Demand Quantification:** The conversation highlighted the massive,
  potentially bottlenecking energy requirements of AI, evidenced by Oracle''s "insatiable
  and astronomical" demand figures and Google’s report of token demand being 50 times
  higher year-over-year.

  *   **LLMs Replacing Traditional Data Sources:** Jordi Visser noted that he now
  uses **Perplexity** for roughly 60% of his financial research, effectively replacing
  significant time previously spent on the **Bloomberg Terminal**, demonstrating a
  shift in how finance professionals consume real-time, detailed data by turning text
  into actionable data.

  *   **Labor Market Softness:** Despite headline strength, the underlying US labor
  market is showing weakness outside of government-supported sectors (leisure/hospitality,
  healthcare), suggesting underlying economic fragility that supports dovish Fed action.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Geopolitical Shocks are Transitory:** Visser argued that historical precedent
  shows geopolitical conflicts (like the recent Iran strike) cause initial volatility
  but rarely have long-lasting economic impacts unless they cause sustained supply
  shocks (e.g., oil staying above $100 for months).

  *   **The Dominant Theme: Power & Energy:** The primary investment thesis is focusing
  on the **Venn diagram** intersection of structural energy demand (driven by AI)
  and potential supply shocks (Middle East instability). Energy names are positioned
  to benefit from both structural growth and short-term risk premiums on oil.

  *   **Bitcoin as Non-Hedge:** Visser explicitly stated he does **not** view Bitcoin
  as a geopolitical hedge, seeing its correlation tied more closely to the broader
  economy and risk assets (stocks). A potential **short squeeze** for Bitcoin later
  in the year was hinted at as a possibility, though not deeply explored.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordi Visser:** Guest analyst providing market structure and trading perspectives
  based on 30 years of experience.

  *   **Larry Ellison (Oracle):** Cited for his commentary confirming "insatiable"
  AI demand, leading to massive CAPEX ($25B+ next year).

  *   **Sundar Pichai (Google):** Mentioned for providing data on the parabolic growth
  in AI token demand.

  *   **Perplexity:** Highlighted as a superior, real-time LLM tool for financial
  research compared to traditional terminals.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Fed Rate Cut Expectation:** Weak CPI data, coupled with a softening labor
  market (rising jobless claims), strongly suggests the Federal Reserve is now likely
  headed toward a rate cut, with a 65% probability assigned to a September cut unless
  inflation unexpectedly spikes due to oil prices.

  *   **US-China Trade "Separation":** The current dynamic is described as a "separation
  period before the divorce," where both nations are trying to build supply chain
  resilience (US focusing on manufacturing/rare earth sourcing; China on consumption
  stimulus). This mediation phase reduces immediate trade war impact.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the market is entering a unique phase where **AI-driven
  structural demand for energy** will override traditional macroeconomic correlations.
  Investors should focus on energy infrastructure and supply rather than reacting
  emotionally to geopolitical headlines. Furthermore, the increasing utility of specialized
  LLMs like Perplexity signals a fundamental shift in how high-level financial data
  analysis is conducted, potentially disrupting established data providers.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Professional Investors, Hedge Fund Managers,
  and Financial Analysts** who require high-level synthesis of geopolitical risk,
  macroeconomic data, and structural technology trends (AI/Energy) to inform tactical
  and strategic portfolio positioning.'
