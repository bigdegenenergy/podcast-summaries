summary: '## Comprehensive Summary of Healthy, Wealthy, and Smart Podcast Episode
  with Steve Lewis (Naboo.ai)


  This episode of the *Healthy, Wealthy, and Smart* podcast, hosted by Dr. Karen Litzey,
  features Steve Lewis, founder of **Naboo.ai**, focusing on the critical need for
  comprehensive, patient-centric health information management. The discussion transitions
  from Lewis’s unique background to the development of a technology solution addressing
  significant gaps in patient support and care coordination.


  ---


  ### 1. Main Narrative Arc and Key Discussion Points


  The episode follows a narrative arc driven by personal necessity:

  1. **The Catalyst:** Steve Lewis recounts leaving a high-profile career working
  with celebrities (like Lenny Kravitz) after his daughter, Bowie, was born with significant
  health challenges requiring intensive care (NICU).

  2. **The Problem Identification:** Over 18 years, Lewis observed a massive technological
  disparity: clinicians have sophisticated EHRs, but patients and families are left
  with fragmented paper records, disparate apps, and overwhelming information silos,
  especially during transitions of care (e.g., pediatric to adult services).

  3. **The Genesis of Naboo.ai:** The idea solidified when his daughter sought independence,
  prompting the question: "What does it mean to be a good patient?" This led to the
  concept of a **single source of truth** for the patient. The name "Naboo" was inspired
  by the Mesopotamian god of wisdom and literacy.

  4. **Product Development & Validation:** Lewis details the journey from initial
  low-code prototyping to securing developer quotes (noting the high initial costs
  quoted) and focusing on proving the concept with real user feedback before scaling.

  5. **The Patient Experience:** The latter half focuses on how the app empowers the
  patient (Bowie is now a major advocate) to manage her own data, track observations,
  and ensure continuity of care across multiple providers.


  ### 2. Major Topics, Themes, and Subject Areas Covered


  *   **Patient Advocacy and Empowerment:** Shifting the patient role from passive
  recipient to active self-advocate.

  *   **Health Information Fragmentation:** The failure of current systems (EHRs,
  paper binders) to provide a unified, portable patient record.

  *   **Care Coordination:** Improving communication among family members, support
  workers, and multiple clinicians.

  *   **Adherence and Outcomes:** Linking better information access directly to improved
  patient adherence (e.g., physiotherapy compliance).

  *   **Safety and Vetting:** Integrating safety features, specifically background
  checks for support workers.

  *   **Startup Journey:** Navigating early-stage funding, developer selection, and
  avoiding common structural pitfalls.


  ### 3. Technical Concepts, Methodologies, or Frameworks Discussed


  *   **Single Source of Truth (SSoT):** The core architectural goal of Naboo.ai—a
  centralized, patient-owned repository for all health data.

  *   **Interoperability vs. Patient Utility:** A key insight shared by a hospital
  CIO was that focusing immediately on complex EHR interoperability is often a distraction;
  the immediate need is organizing the *patient''s* view of the data.

  *   **Low-Code/No-Code Development:** Used initially for rapid prototyping and concept
  validation.

  *   **Ambient Note-Taking:** Utilizing technology (likely AI-assisted) to capture
  provider instructions during appointments.

  *   **Compliance Frameworks:** Mention of necessary standards like **HIPAA, GDPR,
  and ISO 27001** as critical considerations for scaling health tech.


  ### 4. Business Implications and Strategic Insights


  *   **Focus on the "Everything Else":** Lewis stresses that the hardest part of
  founding a health tech startup is often not the product-solution fit, but the business
  structure, shareholding, and legal setup required for scalability.

  *   **Validation Over Funding:** The strategy was to achieve feature validation
  (users saying, "I would pay for this") before seeking major funding or getting bogged
  down in complex enterprise integration.

  *   **Community Support:** The value of joining specific health tech innovation
  communities (like Innovation Bay in Australia) over generic startup accelerators.

  *   **Strategic Partnerships:** The early relationship established with Google following
  the initial presentation.


  ### 5. Key Personalities, Experts, or Thought Leaders Mentioned


  *   **Steve Lewis:** Founder of Naboo.ai, driven by his daughter Bowie’s complex
  health journey.

  *   **Bowie Lewis:** Steve’s daughter, who is actively using the app and becoming
  a public advocate for the technology.

  *   **Dr. Peter Steer:** CEO of the Royal Hospital for Children in Melbourne, who
  quoted **Frederick Buechner**: "Your true calling is where your gladness and the
  world''s deep need meet."

  *   **Leigh Ann Cuncello:** Expert in child protection (UN experience), whose insights
  spurred the integration of rigorous background checks into Naboo.

  *   **Ben King:** Developer ally who helped guide the product build with an understanding
  of the entrepreneurial journey.

  *   **James Mellie:** Provided crucial advice on avoiding structural pitfalls in
  startup formation.


  ### 6. Predictions, Trends, or Future-Looking Statements


  *   **Global Expansion:** Plans to expand compliance checks (like those for support
  workers) beyond Australia.

  *   **Patient Experience Congress:** Naboo.ai is scheduled to be showcased at major
  international forums (Abu Dhabi, Dubai).

  *   **Reframing Disability:** Lewis praises the UAE term "People of Determination,"
  suggesting that what is often labeled a disability can be viewed as a "superpower."


  ### 7. Practical Applications and Real-World Examples


  *   **Family Coordination:** Eliminating the need for multiple family members to
  repeatedly ask for updates or search for shared'
