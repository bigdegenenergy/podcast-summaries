    asset. People go to it, but in moments of crisis, like not, or we're in a three-month
    crisis, right? But in the reaction to news, Bitcoin is a very, very liquid market.
    And because Bitcoin is a very liquid market, people panic. News breaks, sell.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Bitcoin’s $10K Candles Are Coming — Get Ready
  | Anthony & John Pompliano


  This 50-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast, featuring Anthony Pompliano and John
  Pompliano, centers on analyzing recent market volatility, particularly in Bitcoin,
  and arguing against the prevailing narrative of an imminent stock market crash.
  The core thesis is that systemic government intervention and the evolving nature
  of digital assets have fundamentally changed market dynamics, favoring continued
  asset appreciation.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion primarily focuses on **Cryptocurrency Markets (Bitcoin)**, **Traditional
  Equities (Stock Market)**, **Macroeconomic Policy (Federal Reserve actions and inflation)**,
  and **Geopolitical Risk Management** as it relates to market stability.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin Liquidity Clearing:** The recent massive liquidation event (around
  $19 billion) in the crypto market successfully "wiped out all the excess leverage,"
  which is viewed as a necessary cleansing mechanism that clears the way for higher
  prices.

  *   **24/7 Market Necessity:** Geopolitical events occurring outside of traditional
  stock market hours (like the Friday-to-Sunday window) are driving increased adoption
  of Bitcoin, as it is the only major asset class open for trading 24/7, providing
  immediate liquidity during crises.

  *   **Dollar Movement vs. Percentage Moves:** The culture around Bitcoin pricing
  is shifting from focusing on percentage gains/losses to focusing on absolute dollar
  movements (e.g., "$10K candles"), indicating the asset is maturing and its aggregate
  dollar moves are increasing, even if the percentage change remains relatively small.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Pessimism is Wrong:** The hosts strongly argue that predictions of an imminent
  market crash or recession are outdated, as the Federal Reserve''s playbook is now
  to aggressively stimulate the economy (using monetary bazookas like rate cuts and
  stimulus) to prevent any bear market lasting longer than 18 months.

  *   **Bull Market Longevity:** Based on historical data, the current bull market
  (three years in) has significant room to run, as the average bull market lasts seven
  to eight years.

  *   **Valuation Justification:** Higher valuations in the stock market are justified
  because modern companies (like those in tech) are achieving higher growth rates
  (e.g., 30% YoY growth for a trillion-dollar company) and demonstrating unprecedented
  efficiency (e.g., growing revenue with fewer employees, as seen with Palantir).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump:** Mentioned for his use of social media and presidential power
  to influence market sentiment and negotiate geopolitical issues (like trade tariffs
  with China).

  *   **Howard Marks (Oaktree):** Cited as a respected value investor who recently
  stated he does not believe the current market is a bubble or heading for a crash.

  *   **Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase):** Noted for acknowledging the current environment
  as a bull market.

  *   **Palantir:** Used as a prime example of a company demonstrating high growth
  alongside increased operational efficiency (revenue per employee).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Fed Playbook:** The central policy theme is the Federal Reserve''s learned
  behavior since 2008: they will prioritize preventing prolonged asset price declines
  and recessions over maintaining the purchasing power of the US dollar. This intervention
  is seen as the primary reason asset prices remain inflated.

  *   **Market Manipulation:** Traditional stock markets are viewed as being manipulated
  by operational hours and circuit breakers, whereas Bitcoin represents a "pure market"
  determined more by spot buyers.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is heading toward a future where:

  1.  Asset prices are structurally supported by central bank intervention, making
  deep, prolonged bear markets unlikely.

  2.  The 24/7 nature of crypto markets will continue to attract capital seeking immediate
  reaction capabilities during global events.

  3.  Bitcoin is maturing from an "adolescent" asset toward "adulthood" (defined as
  reaching a $10 trillion market cap), at which point major institutions and central
  banks will fully embrace it.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Active Crypto Investors, Institutional Investors,
  and Financial Professionals** interested in macro analysis, asset allocation strategies,
  and understanding the evolving relationship between central bank policy and asset
  valuations.'
