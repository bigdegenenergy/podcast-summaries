    of Bitcoin''.'

    the US government actually acquired a bunch of Bitcoin, but eventually needs to
    borrow more than it can and needs to start pledging Bitcoin somewhere to borrow
    that money, and then the debt actually then becomes kind of larger than anything
    that it can be paid back for, and then it becomes kind of like nationalized in

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why Isn’t Bitcoin Pumping While Gold Soars?
  | Jeff Park


  This 41-minute episode of the POMP podcast, featuring Jeff Park (CIO at ProCat BTC),
  dives into the current macro environment, focusing on why Bitcoin is lagging gold
  despite favorable conditions for risk assets, and explores the evolving role of
  reserve assets in global finance.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Global Macroeconomics and Digital Assets**, specifically
  analyzing the divergence between gold and Bitcoin performance, the mechanics of
  the global dollarized economy (including central bank swap lines), geopolitical
  trade wars (US/China), and the historical precedent for reserve asset adoption,
  drawing parallels between the SDR and Bitcoin.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **SDRs as a Precursor to Bitcoin:** Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a basket
  of major currencies created by the IMF, function as a neutral, cooperative reserve
  asset. The conversation frames Bitcoin as the potential successor to the SDR, offering
  a truly neutral, non-fiat-based asset that could serve as pristine collateral in
  international finance.

  *   **Swap Lines Mechanics:** Swap lines are detailed as the "plumbing" of the dollarized
  economy, allowing central banks to exchange currencies to provide dollar liquidity
  during systemic fractures. The US Treasury uses its Exchange Stabilization Facility
  (ESF), primarily holding SDRs, to execute these interventions.

  *   **Bitcoin as Usable Collateral:** Unlike gold, which is often held passively,
  Bitcoin has the potential to function as a true liquid currency at the nation-state
  level—able to be pledged, lent, borrowed, and transacted, moving beyond just a store
  of value.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Gold''s Current Dominance:** Gold is currently sucking up market liquidity
  because it represents the most obvious and certain store of value amid global chaos
  and fear, driven by both central bank flows (e.g., Shanghai Futures Exchange accumulation)
  and retail investor psychology.

  *   **Bitcoin''s Lagging Performance:** Despite expected rate cuts and strong institutional
  adoption conduits, Bitcoin is underperforming. The market is currently prioritizing
  certainty (gold) over the potential future utility of Bitcoin.

  *   **Liquidity and Risk Assets:** Generally, increased credit creation and liquidity
  from governments (both US fiscal dominance and Chinese regional liquidity injections)
  remain positive drivers for risk assets, including Bitcoin, in the long term.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jeff Park:** Chief Investment Officer at ProCat BTC, providing the macro analysis.

  *   **Anthony Pompliano (POMP):** Host, driving the discussion on investment strategy
  and the role of reserve assets.

  *   **The Bank of England:** Used as a historical case study, highlighting its 250-year
  history as a private entity before nationalization, mirroring the potential arc
  of a major asset like Bitcoin becoming integrated into national apparatuses due
  to overwhelming debt.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Argentina Intervention:** The US Treasury''s intervention in Argentina (buying
  pesos via swap lines) highlights the geopolitical weaponization of dollar hegemony.
  The discussion notes the US bought pesos using SDRs from the ESF, raising questions
  about taxpayer risk and the priority given to fiat currencies over Bitcoin.

  *   **Trade War as Capital War:** Geopolitical tensions (US/China) are increasingly
  recognized as capital wars, where trade disputes directly impact capital account
  flows and the privilege of US financial assets attracting foreign investment.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that the next major phase of Bitcoin adoption will likely
  involve central banks or nation-states using it as **pristine collateral** within
  the global financial plumbing, potentially replacing or augmenting the role of the
  SDR. The path forward for Bitcoin''s price appreciation hinges significantly on
  central banks accepting and integrating it, similar to how gold was integrated historically.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto/Web3 Professionals, Macro Investors, and Financial Strategists** who need
  to understand the intersection of sovereign finance, central banking mechanics,
  and the long-term narrative for Bitcoin as a global reserve asset.'
