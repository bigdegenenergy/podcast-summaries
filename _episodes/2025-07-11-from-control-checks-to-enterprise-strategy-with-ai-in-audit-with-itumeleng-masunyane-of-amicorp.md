summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: From Control Checks to Enterprise Strategy with
  AI in Audit - with Itumeleng Masunyane of Amicorp


  This 18-minute episode of the AI and Business Podcast, featuring Itumeleng Masunyane,
  SVP of Internal Audit at AMACorp Group, explores the transformative shift occurring
  in internal audit functions, particularly within the financial services sector,
  driven by Artificial Intelligence. The core narrative arc moves from the traditional,
  backward-looking role of compliance checking to a proactive, strategic partnership
  role enabled by AI technologies.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **AI adoption in Internal Audit and Compliance within
  Financial Services**. Key topics included the evolution of audit responsibilities,
  the necessity of shifting from reactive to proactive risk monitoring, the required
  cultural and data infrastructure changes, and the enduring importance of human judgment
  alongside advanced AI capabilities, including Generative AI (LLMs).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Automation of Deterministic Tasks:** AI is effectively automating routine,
  low-level control testing and mundane tasks, freeing up audit teams'' time for strategic
  work.

  *   **Shift to Interpretation:** Auditors must evolve from being mere reviewers
  to becoming **interpreters of intelligence systems**, requiring increased data fluency
  and digital literacy to analyze AI-generated insights.

  *   **Generative AI in Case Making:** Even in highly rules-based audit areas, probabilistic
  technologies like LLMs can be used to construct stronger, more persuasive arguments
  and reports for regulators and stakeholders.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Strategic Repositioning:** AI enables internal audit teams to transition from
  checklist compliance officers to **strategic business partners** by providing timely,
  data-driven insights on emerging risks.

  *   **Value Creation through Proactivity:** By anticipating new risks and demonstrating
  how to mitigate them using AI-derived metrics, audit builds trust and enhances its
  value proposition to the organization, enabling growth.

  *   **Data Governance Imperative:** Successful deployment of AI for deeper insights
  requires robust data governance and alignment of audit metrics with overall business
  growth objectives.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Itumeleng Masunyane (Guest):** SVP of Internal Audit at **AMACorp Group**,
  a global financial services firm specializing in corporate management and fund administration
  across emerging markets.

  *   **AMACorp Group:** Highlighted as a global firm operating in complex, regulated
  environments, providing context for the need for advanced audit capabilities.

  *   **MindBridge:** Mentioned as the sponsor of this special series on AI and financial
  workflows, indicating a focus on AI solutions in audit technology.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward an audit function that is **real-time, agile, and
  deeply integrated** with business strategy. The future auditor will be multidisciplinary,
  connecting dots between risk, technology, ethics, and strategy. While AI will handle
  data ingestion and anomaly detection, the ultimate differentiator will be the human
  capacity for **judgment, context, and agility** in responding to rapidly changing
  business goals—a capability machines currently lack.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Audit Executives, Risk Management Professionals,
  Compliance Officers, and CIOs/CDOs** in regulated industries, particularly **Financial
  Services**. It is highly relevant for professionals focused on AI/tech adoption
  strategy within governance and control functions.'
