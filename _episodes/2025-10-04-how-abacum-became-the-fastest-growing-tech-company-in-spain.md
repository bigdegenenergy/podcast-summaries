summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Transforming Finance into a Growth Engine with
  Julio Martin-Ez of Abercum


  This episode features an in-depth conversation with **Julio Martin-Ez**, Co-founder
  and CEO of **Abercum**, an AI-native Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) platform.
  The discussion centers on how modern finance teams are evolving from reactive back-office
  functions into proactive growth enablers by leveraging technology to automate manual
  processes and gain critical business insights. Abercum’s explosive growth—ranked
  as the fastest-growing tech company in Spain with **6,733% revenue growth** over
  four years—serves as a case study for this transformation.


  ---


  ### Key Takeaways for Technology Professionals:


  **1. The Mandate for Modern Finance: Growth Enablement**

  *   **Core Problem:** Finance teams are pressured by regulatory changes and macroeconomic
  uncertainty, forcing CFOs to move beyond manual data wrangling to become strategic
  business partners.

  *   **Abercum''s Solution:** The platform focuses on three outcomes: saving time,
  ensuring confidence in data, and enabling faster, smarter decisions. This is achieved
  by automating data wrangling, cleaning, and normalization across financial and operational
  data, providing a **single source of truth**.


  **2. Strategic Importance of Granular Analysis (Shadow P&Ls)**

  *   Fast-growing, multi-product companies (like Abercum''s clients: Moneybox, Banking
  Circle, Factorial) require deep visibility into performance across various dimensions
  (products, geographies, customer segments).

  *   The most pressing request from CFOs is often the creation of **"shadow P&Ls"**—analytical
  breakdowns that reveal the true profitability and impact drivers deep within the
  business, allowing for better capital allocation decisions.


  **3. Practicality of Scenario Planning**

  *   Traditional spreadsheet-based scenario planning is **"very cumbersome,"** often
  turning simple "what if" questions from leadership into week-long projects due to
  messy data duplication.

  *   Abercum enables **seamless scenario planning** because its strong, interconnected
  data foundation allows users to easily manipulate variables, assemble scenarios,
  and surface comparative insights rapidly, aligning stakeholders faster.


  **4. Nuanced View on AI in Quantitative Finance**

  *   Martin-Ez argues that current **Large Language Models (LLMs) are fundamentally
  non-deterministic**, making them unsuitable for precise, quantitative financial
  modeling where exact, repeatable outputs are required.

  *   **The Near-Term Reality:** AI/ML excels at automating repetitive, manual tasks.
  For complex financial use cases requiring judgment, context, and nuance, AI remains
  a **"co-pilot rather than a substitution,"** necessitating a human in the loop.

  *   **Future Outlook:** He notes that emerging algorithms like **Large Time Series
  Models (LTMs)**, which couple LLMs with deterministic mathematical foundations,
  are beginning to address quantitative needs in forecasting and budgeting.


  **5. Strategic Insight: Efficiency Over Vanity Metrics**

  *   In the current climate, investors prioritize **efficient growth**. Founders
  should focus on building strong business foundations rather than chasing pure top-line
  growth fueled by excessive capital.

  *   **Real-World Example:** Abercum achieved **tripled year-on-year revenue with
  a flat headcount**, demonstrating formidable scalability and capital allocation
  efficiency—a key indicator of long-term viability.


  **6. Spanish Tech Ecosystem Spotlight**

  *   The Spanish tech scene (Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia, Bilbao) is booming, attracting
  **world talent** due to quality of life combined with successful scale-up stories
  (e.g., Factorial, TravelPerk).

  *   This success fosters a generous ecosystem where established founders advise
  and angel invest in new entrepreneurs.


  **7. Actionable Advice & Future Focus**

  *   **For Founders:** Focus on core business foundations and efficiency; this ensures
