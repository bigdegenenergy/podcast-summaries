  extracted: have a similar attitude towards other industries that it's like much
    more complicated right I mean it's so Robin Hansen has this abstraction of like
    seeing things in near mode or just farm mode right and I think if you don't know
    a lot about the topic because then you see it sort of in farm mode and you sort
    of simplify and that's right things you know you see a lot more detail like in
    general I think the thing I would say and the reason I also believe that just
    like abstract reasoning and like sort of structure reasoning or even Bayesian
    reasoning by itself is not like sufficient or like it's not as powerful as many
    other people think is because I think there's just this like enormous amount of
    like richness and detail in the real world that like you just can't like reason
    about it right you you need to see it and obviously that like that is not an obstacle
    to AI being incredibly transformative because as I said like you can scale your
    data collection you can scale experiments you do both in the AI industry itself
    and just more broadly in the economy so you just discover more things more economic
    activity means we have more exposed surface area to have more discoveries like
    all of these are things that have happened in our past right there's no reason
    that they they couldn't speed up like the like the fundamental thing is that there's
    no reason fundamentally why economic growth can't be much faster than it is today
    like it's probably about us to us right now just because humans are such an important
    bottleneck they both supply the labor they play crucial roles in the process of
    like discovery of various kinds of productivity growth there's just strong complementarity
    which doesn't make sense with capital that you can't substitute machines and so
    on for humans very well so the growth of the economy and growth growth productivity
    just ends up being bottlenecks by the growth of human population publicly available
    data is running out so major AI labs like meta google deep mind and open AI partner
    with scale to push the boundaries of what's possible through scales data foundry
    major labs get access to high quality data to fuel post training including advanced
    reasoning capabilities as AI research forward we must also strengthen human sovereignty

    for AI safety scale published humanities last exam a groundbreaking new AI benchmark
    evaluating expert level reasoning and knowledge capabilities across a wider range
    of fields if you're an AI researcher or engineer and you want to learn more about
    how scales data foundry and research lab can help you go beyond the current frontier
    of capabilities go to scale dot com slash the war cash let me ask this in general
    question what is what has happened in China over the last 50 years yeah would
    you describe that as like in principle the same kind of explosive growth that
    you expect from me because there's like a lot of labor that makes the marginal
    product of capital really high which allows you to have like 10 percent plus economic
    growth rates is that basically in principle for me I so I would say in some ways
    it's similar in some ways it's not the way probably the most important way which
    is not similar is that in China you see it is relative like you see a massive
    amount of capital accumulation yeah substantial amount of adoption of new technologies
    and probably also human capital accumulation to some extent and but you're not
    seeing a huge scale up in the labor force in the fake labor force while for AI
    you should expect to see a scale up in a labor force as well not in human workforce
    but in the AI workforce I think you did kind of like well maybe not consecutive
    increases in the labor forcing but like you did the key thing here is just the
    simultaneous scaling of both these things and so like you might ask the question
    of isn't it like basically half of what's going to happen with AI that you scale
    up you know capital accumulation in China but actually that's really not like
    if you get both of these things to scale that that gives you just much faster
    growth and a very different picture but at the same time if you're just asking
    like what would 30 percent growth per year like look like like in terms of like
    if you're just gonna have an intuition for how transformative that would be in
    concrete terms then I think looking at Chinese not such a bad case like you can
    especially in the 2000s or maybe late 90s like that gives you a good that seems
    slower than over forecast right I think also looking at the industrial revolution
    is pretty good when that's revolution is very slow so but just in terms of the
    types of the kind of the margins along which we made progress in terms of products
    so what what didn't happen you the thing that didn't happen during the industrial
    revolution is we just produced a lot more of things that people were producing
    prior to the industrial like producing a lot more crops and maybe a lot more kind
    of pre-industrial revolution style houses or whatever on farms instead what we
    got is along pretty much every main sector of the economy we just had many different
    products that are totally different from what was being consumed prior to that
    so in transportation in food in healthcare is a very big deal and to be out of
    so another question because I'm not sure I understand like how you're defining
    the learning by doing versus explicit R&D because there's like the way for taxes
    that companies say what they call R&D but then there's like the intuitive understanding
    of R&D so if you think about how AI is boosting a TFP you could say that like
    right now if you just had replaced the TSMC process engineers with AI's and they're
    finding different ways in which to improve that process and like improve efficiencies
    improve yield right I would kind of call that R&D on the other hand you emphasize
    this the other part of TFP which is like better management then learning by doing
    that kind of stuff but learning by doing could be you could I mean how much how
    much on for you like you're gonna get to the you're gonna get to like the fucking
    Dyson spear by better management like it's not just but but but that's not the
    argument right like the point is that there are all these different things that
    like somewhat that might be more complimentary than others the point is not that
    you can get to a Dyson Sphere by just scaling labor and capital like that's not
    a point like you need to scale everything at once so just as you can't get to
    a Dyson Sphere by just scaling labor and capital you also can't get to it by just
    scaling TFP that doesn't work I think there's a very important distinction between
    what is necessary you know to scale to get the this you know Dyson Sphere world
    and what is important like in some sense producing food is necessary um but but
    of course producing food doesn't get you to Dyson Sphere right so I think R&D
    is necessary but on its own isn't sufficient and scaling up the economy is also
    necessary on its own is not sufficient and then you can ask the question what
    is the relative importance of each yeah so I think our view here is like very
    much the same we're like like it is very connected to our view about the software
    and do you think we were just saying like there are these bottlenecks so you need
    to scale everything at once like this is just a general view but I think people
    like misunderstand us sometimes as saying that uh like R&D is not important like
    no that's not that's not what we what we're saying we're saying it is important
    it is less important in relative terms than some other things none of which are
    by themselves sufficient to enable this growth so the question is like how do
    you do the credit attribution I mean one way in which in economics standard do
    that is to look at the elasticity of output to the different factors like like
    capital is less important than labor because the output elasticity of like labor
    elasticity output is like 0
  text: we should have a similar attitude towards other industries that it's like
    much more complicated right I mean it's so Robin Hansen has this abstraction of
    like seeing things in near mode or just farm mode right and I think if you don't
    know a lot about the topic because then you see it sort of in farm mode and you
    sort of simplify and that's right things you know you see a lot more detail like
    in general I think the thing I would say and the reason I also believe that just
    like abstract reasoning and like sort of structure reasoning or even Bayesian
    reasoning by itself is not like sufficient or like it's not as powerful as many
    other people think is because I think there's just this like enormous amount of
    like richness and detail in the real world that like you just can't like reason
    about it right you you need to see it and obviously that like that is not an obstacle
    to AI being incredibly transformative because as I said like you can scale your
    data collection you can scale experiments you do both in the AI industry itself
    and just more broadly in the economy so you just discover more things more economic
    activity means we have more exposed surface area to have more discoveries like
    all of these are things that have happened in our past right there's no reason
    that they they couldn't speed up like the like the fundamental thing is that there's
    no reason fundamentally why economic growth can't be much faster than it is today
    like it's probably about us to us right now just because humans are such an important
    bottleneck they both supply the labor they play crucial roles in the process of
    like discovery of various kinds of productivity growth there's just strong complementarity
    which doesn't make sense with capital that you can't substitute machines and so
    on for humans very well so the growth of the economy and growth growth productivity
    just ends up being bottlenecks by the growth of human population publicly available
    data is running out so major AI labs like meta google deep mind and open AI partner

    you do the credit attribution I mean one way in which in economics standard do
    that is to look at the elasticity of output to the different factors like like
    capital is less important than labor because the output elasticity of like labor
    elasticity output is like 0.
  type: recommendation
- actionable: true
  confidence: medium
  extracted: stop this and then maybe you want to have the capacity so that we could
    make that decision right but that's very hard like this I'd never listen how do
    you build that up well I don't know I mean you we need to like like that's the
    kind of thing I would be trying to do yeah I think the overall takeaway I take
    from the way that I think about it and you know I guess we think about it as be
    more humble in what you think you can achieve yeah and like just focus on the
    near term not because it's more morally important than the longer term but just
    because it's much easier to have a predictably positive impact on that well one
    thing I noticed over the last few weeks of thinking about these bigger picture
    topics and interviewing Daniel and Scott and then you two is how often I've changed
    my mind about the everything from the smallest questions about when AI will arrive
    it's funny that that's the small question and the grand scheme for things to to
    whether there will be an intelligence explosion or whether there will be an R&D
    explosion to whether there will be a explosive growth or how to think about that
    and if you're in a position where you are just like incredibly epistemically uncertain
    about what's going to happen I think it's important to just like directly acknowledge
    like this is instead of just instead of becoming super certain about like your
    next conclusion just being like let me just at least for my perspective I'm just
    let me just take a step back I'm like I'm not sure what's going on here and I
    think a lot more people should be from that perspective unless you've had the
    same opinion about AI for many years in which case I have other questions for
    you about why that's the case and in other situations I mean generally how we
    as a society deal with topics on which we are this uncertain is just to have freedom
    decentralization both decentralized not decentralized knowledge and decentralized
    decision making take the reins and not to do super high volatility centralized
    moves like hey less nationalized so we can make sure that we can make sure the
    the sufferers only singularities aligned or not to do make moves that are just
    incredibly contingent on one worldview that are brittle under other considerations
    and that's become a much more salient part of my worldview I think just classical
    liberalism is the way we deal with being this epistemically uncertain and I think
    we should be more uncertain than we've ever been in history as opposed to many
    other people who seem to be more certain than they are about other sort of more
    mundane topics yeah I think it's it's very hard to predict what happens because
    of this acceleration basically means that you find it much harder to predict what
    the world might be in internar's time I think these questions are also just like
    very difficult and we don't have very strong empirical evidence and then there's
    like a lot of this kind of disagreement that exists like I would say that it's
    important to like the like in a lot of cases in a lot of situations it's much
    more important to be like maintain flexibility and ability to adapt to new circumstances
    new information than it is to get a specific plan that's going to be like correct
    and like that's going to very detailed and has a lot of specific policy recommendations
    and things that you should do so like that's actually also the thing that I would
    recommend like if I want to make the make the transition to AI in this period
    of like social growth go better I would just prefer it to like in general had
    like higher quality institutions yeah and but I am much less bullish on someone
    sitting down today and working out okay like what fully in what fully this intelligence
    explosion or explosive growth be like what should we do like like I think plans
    that you work out today are not going to be that useful when the events are actually
    occur because you're going to let you lose so much stuff that you're gonna like
    update on so many questions that these plans are just going to become obsolete
    that's right it's one thing you could do is you could look at say the history
    of war planning and how successful war planning has been for like actually anticipating
    what actually happens when the war actually happened so for one example I think
    I might have mentioned this in like off the record at some point but before the
    second one where happens people were obviously people saw that they were all these
    new technologies like tanks and airplanes and so on which were now like they exist
    in World War One but in a much more primitive setting so they were wondering what
    is going to be the impact of these technologies now that we have in them in much
    greater scale and the British government had estimates of how many casualties
    there will be from aerial bombardment in the first few weeks of the second war
    and they expected hundreds of thousands of that casualties basically in like two
    weeks three weeks after the war begins so the idea was that air bombing is basically
    just unstoppable force all the major urban centers are going to get bombed tons
    of people will die so basically like we can't have a war because if there's a
    war then it will be a disaster because like we will have this air of bombardment
    but later it turned out that that was totally wrong in fact in the in all Britain
    there were fewer casualties from air bombing in the entire sort of six years of
    the second war then the British government expected in the first few weeks of
    the war like they had less casualties in six years than I expected it in like
    few weeks so why did they get it wrong well I mean there are lots of worrying
    practical reasons like for example it turned out to be really infeasible to bomb
    especially early on to bomb cities in daytime because your aircraft would just
    get shot down yeah but then if you tried to bomb at night time then your bombing
    was really imprecise and only a very small fraction of it actually hit and then
    that people also underestimated the extent to which people on the ground could
    like fire fighters and so on could just sort of go around the city and then put
    out fires from bombs that were falling on structures they overestimated the amount
    of economic damage that it would do they underestimated how economically costly
    it would be like basically you're sending these aircraft and then they're getting
    shot down while an aircraft is very expensive so in the end what turned out is
    when the allies started bombing Germany they were like for each dollar of capital
    they were destroying in Germany they were spending like four to five dollars on
    the aircraft and fuel and training of the pilots and so on that they were sending
    in missions and the casual trade was very high which later got covered up by the
    government because they didn't want people to worry about you know so that is
    a kind of situation where all the planning that you would have done in advance
    predicated on this assumption of like air bombing is going to be this like nuclear
    weapons light basically like extremely destructive there's going to be some aspect
    to which I mean it was like 84,000 people died in one night of fire bombing in
    Tokyo like Germany like large fractions of their but that was over the period
    of six years right there were like single fire bombing I mean it was a case that
    during the end of world war two when they were looking for the place to launch
    the atomic bombs that's right they just had to go through like a dozen cities
    because they like they were just want to be worth nuking them because they're
    already destroyed by the fire bombing that's right but but the level of this if
    you look at the level of destruction that there was it's expected within the space
    of a few weeks and then this level of destruction took many years so there was
    like a toward remained should miss much or something like that was pretty huge
    yeah so it affected the way people think about it right an important like underlying
    theme of much of what we have discussed is like how powerful just reasoning about
    things is to making progress about what specific plans you want to make to prepare
    and make this transition to advance the I go well yeah and our view is well it's
    actually quite hard and you need to make contact with the actual world in order
    to inform most of your beliefs about what actually happens and so it's it's somewhat
    futile to think to do a lot of kind of war gaming and figure out you know how
    AI might go and what we can do today to make that go a lot better because a lot
    of the policies you might come up with might just look fairly silly and I think
    there's in the in the thinking about how AI actually has this impact again people
    think oh you know just AI reasoning about doing science and doing R&D just has
    this drastic impact on you know the overall economy or technology and our view
    as well actually again making contact with the real world and getting a lot of
    data from experiments and from deployment and so on it's just very important so
    I think there is this underlying underlying kind of latent variable which explains
    some of this disagreement both on the policy prescriptions and about the extent
    to which we should be humble versus ambitious about what we all to do today as
    well as for thinking about the mechanism through which AI has this impact and
    this underlying latent thing is like what is the power of reason like how much
    can we reason about when what might happen how much can reasoning in general figure
    things out about the world and about technology and you know so that is like a
    kind of core underlying disagreement here yeah yeah I do want to ask you say in
    your announcement we want to accelerate this a broad automation of labor as fast
    as possible as you know many people think it's a bad idea to accelerate this yes
    the broad automation of labor and AGI and everything that's involved there why
    do you think this is good so the argument for why it's good is that we're going
    to have this enormous increase in economic growth which is going to mean like
    enormous amounts of wealth and like incredible new products that you can't even
    imagine and like healthcare or whatever and like the quality of life of the typical
    person is probably going to go up a lot early on probably also their wages are
    going to go up because the AI systems are going to be automating things that are
    complementary to their work or like it's going to be automating part of their
    work and then you'll be doing dress and then you'll be getting paid much more
    on that and in the long term eventually we do extra wages to fall just because
    of arbitrage with the AI's but by that point we think humans will own enormous
    amounts of capital and there will also be like ways in which even the people who
    don't own capital we think are just going to be much better off than they are
    today like I think it's just hard to express in words the amount of wealth and
    increased variety of products that we would get in this role it will be probably
    more than a difference between like 1800 and today so if you imagine that difference
    it's like such a huge difference and I would imagine like two times three times
    whatever the standard argument against this is why does the speed to get their
    matter so much because especially if the tradeoff against the speed is the probability
    that this transition is achieved successfully in a way that benefits humans I
    mean it's unclear that this trades off against the probability of it being achieved
    successfully or something like there might be an alignment tax I mean maybe like
    you can also just do the calculation of how much a year's worth of delay costs
    for current people like you know this is this enormous amount of utility that
    people are able to enjoy and that gets brought forward by year or pushed back
    by year if you delay things by year and how much is this this this worthwhile
    you know you can you can look at simple models of how concave people's utility
    functions are and do some calculations and maybe that's worth on the order of
    tens of trillions of dollars per year in consumption that is roughly the amount
    consumers might be willing to defer in order to get you know bring forward the
    date of automation one year in absolute terms it's high in relative terms yeah
    relative to if you did think it was going to nurture the probability when we're
    another of building systems that are aligned and so far then it's like just so
    small compared to all of the future I agree so like there are a couple of things
    here first of all I think the way you think about this matter so first of all
    we don't actually think that it's it's clear whether speeding things up or slowing
    things down actually makes like do me outcome more or less likely like I think
    it's just a question that doesn't seem obvious to us like we don't like partly
    because of our views on the software R&D side we don't really believe that if
    you just pause and then you like do research for 20 years at a fixed level of
    compute scale that you're actually going to make that much progress on relevance
    questions on alignment or something like I think like imagine you were trying
    to make progress on alignments in 2016 with the compute budget so 2016 and the
    like well you would have gotten nowhere basically like you would have discovered
    none of the things that people have today discovered and that turned out to be
    useful and I think if you pause today then we will be in a very similar position
    in 10 years right like we would have not made a bunch of discoveries so this scaling
    is just really important to make progress on alignments in our view and then there's
    a separate question of how long term is should you be in a very different sense
    so there's a moral sense or like how much should you actually care about people
    who are alive today as opposed to people who are not yet born as some moral question
    and there's also a practical question of as we discuss how certain can you be
    about the impacts your present actions are actually going to have on the future
  text: we should stop this and then maybe you want to have the capacity so that we
    could make that decision right but that's very hard like this I'd never listen
    how do you build that up well I don't know I mean you we need to like like that's
    the kind of thing I would be trying to do yeah I think the overall takeaway I
    take from the way that I think about it and you know I guess we think about it
    as be more humble in what you think you can achieve yeah and like just focus on
    the near term not because it's more morally important than the longer term but
    just because it's much easier to have a predictably positive impact on that well

    like a lot of this kind of disagreement that exists like I would say that it's
    important to like the like in a lot of cases in a lot of situations it's much
    more important to be like maintain flexibility and ability to adapt to new circumstances
    new information than it is to get a specific plan that's going to be like correct
    and like that's going to very detailed and has a lot of specific policy recommendations
    and things that you should do so like that's actually also the thing that I would
    recommend like if I want to make the make the transition to AI in this period
    of like social growth go better I would just prefer it to like in general had
    like higher quality institutions yeah and but I am much less bullish on someone
    sitting down today and working out okay like what fully in what fully this intelligence
    explosion or explosive growth be like what should we do like like I think plans
    that you work out today are not going to be that useful when the events are actually
    occur because you're going to let you lose so much stuff that you're gonna like
    update on so many questions that these plans are just going to become obsolete
    that's right it's one thing you could do is you could look at say the history
    of war planning and how successful war planning has been for like actually anticipating
    what actually happens when the war actually happened so for one example I think
    I might have mentioned this in like off the record at some point but before the
    second one where happens people were obviously people saw that they were all these
    new technologies like tanks and airplanes and so on which were now like they exist
    in World War One but in a much more primitive setting so they were wondering what
    is going to be the impact of these technologies now that we have in them in much
    greater scale and the British government had estimates of how many casualties
    there will be from aerial bombardment in the first few weeks of the second war
    and they expected hundreds of thousands of that casualties basically in like two
    weeks three weeks after the war begins so the idea was that air bombing is basically
    just unstoppable force all the major urban centers are going to get bombed tons
    of people will die so basically like we can't have a war because if there's a
    war then it will be a disaster because like we will have this air of bombardment
    but later it turned out that that was totally wrong in fact in the in all Britain
    there were fewer casualties from air bombing in the entire sort of six years of
    the second war then the British government expected in the first few weeks of
    the war like they had less casualties in six years than I expected it in like
    few weeks so why did they get it wrong well I mean there are lots of worrying
    practical reasons like for example it turned out to be really infeasible to bomb
    especially early on to bomb cities in daytime because your aircraft would just
    get shot down yeah but then if you tried to bomb at night time then your bombing
    was really imprecise and only a very small fraction of it actually hit and then
    that people also underestimated the extent to which people on the ground could
    like fire fighters and so on could just sort of go around the city and then put
    out fires from bombs that were falling on structures they overestimated the amount
    of economic damage that it would do they underestimated how economically costly
    it would be like basically you're sending these aircraft and then they're getting
    shot down while an aircraft is very expensive so in the end what turned out is
    when the allies started bombing Germany they were like for each dollar of capital
    they were destroying in Germany they were spending like four to five dollars on
    the aircraft and fuel and training of the pilots and so on that they were sending
    in missions and the casual trade was very high which later got covered up by the
    government because they didn't want people to worry about you know so that is
    a kind of situation where all the planning that you would have done in advance
    predicated on this assumption of like air bombing is going to be this like nuclear
    weapons light basically like extremely destructive there's going to be some aspect
    to which I mean it was like 84,000 people died in one night of fire bombing in
    Tokyo like Germany like large fractions of their but that was over the period
    of six years right there were like single fire bombing I mean it was a case that
    during the end of world war two when they were looking for the place to launch
    the atomic bombs that's right they just had to go through like a dozen cities
    because they like they were just want to be worth nuking them because they're
    already destroyed by the fire bombing that's right but but the level of this if
    you look at the level of destruction that there was it's expected within the space
    of a few weeks and then this level of destruction took many years so there was
    like a toward remained should miss much or something like that was pretty huge
    yeah so it affected the way people think about it right an important like underlying
    theme of much of what we have discussed is like how powerful just reasoning about
    things is to making progress about what specific plans you want to make to prepare
    and make this transition to advance the I go well yeah and our view is well it's
    actually quite hard and you need to make contact with the actual world in order
    to inform most of your beliefs about what actually happens and so it's it's somewhat
    futile to think to do a lot of kind of war gaming and figure out you know how
    AI might go and what we can do today to make that go a lot better because a lot
    of the policies you might come up with might just look fairly silly and I think
    there's in the in the thinking about how AI actually has this impact again people
    think oh you know just AI reasoning about doing science and doing R&D just has
    this drastic impact on you know the overall economy or technology and our view
    as well actually again making contact with the real world and getting a lot of
    data from experiments and from deployment and so on it's just very important so
    I think there is this underlying underlying kind of latent variable which explains
    some of this disagreement both on the policy prescriptions and about the extent
    to which we should be humble versus ambitious about what we all to do today as
    well as for thinking about the mechanism through which AI has this impact and
    this underlying latent thing is like what is the power of reason like how much
    can we reason about when what might happen how much can reasoning in general figure
    things out about the world and about technology and you know so that is like a
    kind of core underlying disagreement here yeah yeah I do want to ask you say in
    your announcement we want to accelerate this a broad automation of labor as fast
    as possible as you know many people think it's a bad idea to accelerate this yes
    the broad automation of labor and AGI and everything that's involved there why
    do you think this is good so the argument for why it's good is that we're going
    to have this enormous increase in economic growth which is going to mean like
    enormous amounts of wealth and like incredible new products that you can't even
    imagine and like healthcare or whatever and like the quality of life of the typical
    person is probably going to go up a lot early on probably also their wages are
    going to go up because the AI systems are going to be automating things that are
    complementary to their work or like it's going to be automating part of their
    work and then you'll be doing dress and then you'll be getting paid much more
    on that and in the long term eventually we do extra wages to fall just because
    of arbitrage with the AI's but by that point we think humans will own enormous
    amounts of capital and there will also be like ways in which even the people who
    don't own capital we think are just going to be much better off than they are
    today like I think it's just hard to express in words the amount of wealth and
    increased variety of products that we would get in this role it will be probably
    more than a difference between like 1800 and today so if you imagine that difference
    it's like such a huge difference and I would imagine like two times three times
    whatever the standard argument against this is why does the speed to get their
    matter so much because especially if the tradeoff against the speed is the probability
    that this transition is achieved successfully in a way that benefits humans I
    mean it's unclear that this trades off against the probability of it being achieved
    successfully or something like there might be an alignment tax I mean maybe like
    you can also just do the calculation of how much a year's worth of delay costs
    for current people like you know this is this enormous amount of utility that
    people are able to enjoy and that gets brought forward by year or pushed back
    by year if you delay things by year and how much is this this this worthwhile
    you know you can you can look at simple models of how concave people's utility
    functions are and do some calculations and maybe that's worth on the order of
    tens of trillions of dollars per year in consumption that is roughly the amount
    consumers might be willing to defer in order to get you know bring forward the
    date of automation one year in absolute terms it's high in relative terms yeah
    relative to if you did think it was going to nurture the probability when we're
    another of building systems that are aligned and so far then it's like just so
    small compared to all of the future I agree so like there are a couple of things
    here first of all I think the way you think about this matter so first of all
    we don't actually think that it's it's clear whether speeding things up or slowing
    things down actually makes like do me outcome more or less likely like I think
    it's just a question that doesn't seem obvious to us like we don't like partly
    because of our views on the software R&D side we don't really believe that if
    you just pause and then you like do research for 20 years at a fixed level of
    compute scale that you're actually going to make that much progress on relevance
    questions on alignment or something like I think like imagine you were trying
    to make progress on alignments in 2016 with the compute budget so 2016 and the
    like well you would have gotten nowhere basically like you would have discovered
    none of the things that people have today discovered and that turned out to be
    useful and I think if you pause today then we will be in a very similar position
    in 10 years right like we would have not made a bunch of discoveries so this scaling
    is just really important to make progress on alignments in our view and then there's
    a separate question of how long term is should you be in a very different sense
    so there's a moral sense or like how much should you actually care about people
    who are alive today as opposed to people who are not yet born as some moral question
    and there's also a practical question of as we discuss how certain can you be
    about the impacts your present actions are actually going to have on the future.
  type: recommendation
- actionable: true
  confidence: medium
  extracted: have where is it going to be a much greater familiarity with their cognitive
    horizons I mean I think AI systems will be very diverse and so it's not super
    meaningful to ask something about you know this very diverse range of systems
    and where we stand in relation to them I mean okay well we able to like cognitively
    access the kinds of considerations they can take on board like humans are diverse
    but no chimp is able to be able to understand this argument in the way that another
    human might be able to right so I'm just like if I'm trying to think about my
    place or a human's place in the world of the future I think it's sort it is a
    relevant concept of is it just that the economy has grown a lot and there's much
    more labor or are there beings who are in this crucial way super intelligent I
    mean there will be many things that we just like fit will fill to understand and
    to some extent there are many things today that people don't understand about
    how the world works and how certain things are made and and then you know how
    important is it for us to have access or in principle be able to access those
    considerations and I think it's not clear to me that that's particularly important
    that like any individual human should be able to access all the relevant considerations
    that produce some outcome like that just seems like overkill like why do you why
    do you need that to happen I think it would be nice in some sense but I think
    if you want to have a very sophisticated world where you have very advanced technology
    those things will just not be inaccessible to you and then like so you have this
    trade-off to an accessibility and maybe how advanced the world is and you know
    for my point of view I'd much rather live in a world which has very advanced technology
    has a lot of products that I'm able to enjoy and a lot of inventions that I can
    you know improve my life with if that means that I just don't understand them
    I mean I think this is like a very simple trade that I like are I'm very willing
    to make okay so let's get back to objections to explosive growth we discussed
    a couple already like here's here's another which is more question than an objection
    where is all this extra output going like who is consuming it if the economy is
    a hundred x bigger in a matter of a decade or something like to what end so first
    of all I think even if you view that along what you might call the the intensive
    margin in the sense that you just have more of the products you have today I think
    there is just a lot of like there will be a lot of appetite for that maybe not
    quite a hundred x that like that might start hitting some the mission terms but
    current GDP per capita on average in the world is 10k years or something right
    and there are people who enjoy millions of dollars and so there's a gap between
    you know what people enjoy and like don't seem to be super diminished in terms
    of marginal utility and so there's a big room there's there's a lot of room on
    just purely the intensive margin of just consuming the things we consume today
    but more and then and then there is this maybe much more important dimension along
    which we will expand which is product sincerity yeah extensive margin of what
    what is the scope of things that you're consuming and if you look at something
    like the industrial evolution that seemed to have been the main dimension along
    which we kind of expanded to consume more right there there's just on any kind
    of sector that you care about transportation medicine you know entertainment and
    food there's just this massive expansion in terms of variety of things that we're
    able to consume that is enabled by new technology or new trade routes or new new
    methods of producing things and so that is I think the really the key thing that
    we will see uh you know come along with this kind of expansion and consumption
    yeah another point that Tyler makes is that there will be some mixture of BAMUEL
    cost disease where you're bottlenecked by the lowest growing thing which grows
    in proportion that the fastest productivity things basically um diminish their
    own share and output yeah that's right yeah I mean like we totally agree with
    that I would say that that that's just like a kind of qualitative consideration
    it doesn't itself it isn't so fell it isn't it's self-sufficient to make a prediction
    about what growth rates are permitted given these BAMUEL effects versus not it's
    just like a qualitative consideration and you might need to make additional assumptions
    to be able to make a quantitative prediction so I think it's a little bit um so
    the like the commissing version of this argument would be if you did the same
    thing that we were doing earlier with the software on the singularly argument
    where we were pointing to essentially the same rejection or there are multiple
    things that can broaden like progress uh so I would be much more convinced if
    someone pointed to like an explicit thing they would be like like here like healthcare
    is like this very important thing and why should we expect AI to like make that
    better like that doesn't seem like that would get better because of AI so like
    that maybe healthcare just becomes a big part of the economy and then that bottleneck
    so like if there was some specific sector maybe the argument is that if there's
    even one no if there's one though that like if that's a small part of the economy
    then you could just still get a lot of growth you just automate everything else
    and that is going to produce a lot of growth so it has to like quantitatively
    work out and so you actually have to be quantitatively specific about what this
    objection is supposed to be right so first of all you have to be specific about
    okay the water these tasks what are the current share in economic output just
    the second thing is you have to be specific about how bad do you think the complementarities
    are so in numerical terms economists use the constant elasticity of substitution
    to quantify this so that gives you a numerical estimate of if you just uh have
    much more output on some dimensions but not that much on other dimensions how
    much does that increase economic output overall and then there's a third question
    you can also imagine you automate a bunch of the economy well a lot of humans
    were working on those jobs so now well they don't need to do that anymore because
    those got automated so they could work on the jobs that haven't yet been automated
    so for example as I gave the example earlier you might imagine a world image remote
    work task get automated first and then sensory motor skills lag behind so you
    might have a world image software engineers like become physical workers instead
    of course in that world the wages of physical workers will be much higher than
    their wages are today so that reallocation also produces a lot of extra growth
    even in the like if bottom x are maximally powerful like it's even if it's literally
    you just look at all the tasks in economy and literally take the worst one for
    productive growth you would still get a lot of increase in output because of this
    reallocation okay so I think one point that I think it's useful to make our experience
    talking to economists about this is that they will bring up these kind of more
    qualitative considerations whereas the arguments that we make are like make specific
    quantitative predictions about growth rates so for example you might ask like
    how fast will the economy double and then we can think about you know an h100
    does about there are some estimates of how much computation the human brain does
    per second and it's about one e15 flopper so it's a bit a bit unclear but and
    then it turns out that an h100 roughly does on that order of computation and so
    you can ask the question of how long does it take for an h100 to pay itself back
    if you run the software of the human brain if you run the software of the human
    brain you can then deploy that in the economy and earn say human wages on the
    order of 50 to 100k a year or whatever in the US and so then it pays itself back
    because it costs on the order of 30k per h100 and so you get a doubling time of
    maybe on the order of a year right and so this is like a very quantitatively specific
    prediction about you know and and then there's the response while you have bum-offacts
    and they're like okay well what does this mean like does it double do you does
    this predicted doubles every two years or every five years like it you need just
    more assumptions in order to make this a coherent objection and so I think a thing
    that's a little bit you know confusing is just that there are these qualitative
    objections that I agree with like botanx R&D important which is part of the reason
    I'm more skeptical of this software singularity story but I think this is not
    sufficient for blocking explosive growth the other objection that I've heard often
    and it might have a similar response from you is this idea that a lot of the economy
    is comprised of o-ring type activities and this refers to I think then the challenger
    the challenger space shuttle explosion there is just like one component I forgot
    what the exact problem with the o-ring was but because of that being faulty the
    whole thing collapsed I mean I think it's quite funny actually because the o-ring
    model is is is taking the product of many many inputs and then the overall output
    is the product of very many things that's right and so but actually this is like
    pretty optimistic from the point of view of having fewer botanx because we pointed
    this out before which again talking about software on the thing where I said like
    if it's the product of computer experiments with resources but if one of those
    products is because of human but you have constant marginal product there right
    no but yeah but if one of those products doesn't scale that is that doesn't limit
    like yeah it means you're less efficient at scaling than your otherwise would
    be but you can still get a lot of it unbounded you can just have unbounded scaling
    in the o-ring world so I actually I disagree with Tyler that he's not conservative
    enough that he should take his you know botanx view more seriously than he actually
    is and yet I disagree with him about like the conclusion and I think that we're
    going to get explosive growth once we have AI that can flexibly substance
  text: we should have where is it going to be a much greater familiarity with their
    cognitive horizons I mean I think AI systems will be very diverse and so it's
    not super meaningful to ask something about you know this very diverse range of
    systems and where we stand in relation to them I mean okay well we able to like
    cognitively access the kinds of considerations they can take on board like humans
    are diverse but no chimp is able to be able to understand this argument in the
    way that another human might be able to right so I'm just like if I'm trying to

    sort it is a relevant concept of is it just that the economy has grown a lot and
    there's much more labor or are there beings who are in this crucial way super

    whole thing collapsed I mean I think it's quite funny actually because the o-ring
    model is is is taking the product of many many inputs and then the overall output
    is the product of very many things that's right and so but actually this is like
    pretty optimistic from the point of view of having fewer botanx because we pointed
    this out before which again talking about software on the thing where I said like
    if it's the product of computer experiments with resources but if one of those
    products is because of human but you have constant marginal product there right
    no but yeah but if one of those products doesn't scale that is that doesn't limit
    like yeah it means you're less efficient at scaling than your otherwise would
    be but you can still get a lot of it unbounded you can just have unbounded scaling
    in the o-ring world so I actually I disagree with Tyler that he's not conservative
    enough that he should take his you know botanx view more seriously than he actually
    is and yet I disagree with him about like the conclusion and I think that we're
    going to get explosive growth once we have AI that can flexibly substance.

    changed a lot more like we can read everything that was written after like 1800s

summary: '## Podcast Summary: AGI is Still 30 Years Away — Ege Erdil & Tamay Besiroglu


  This 188-minute episode features Ege Erdil and Tamay Besiroglu, founders of the
  new company **Mechanize** (focused on work automation), discussing their contrarian,
  longer-term view on achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) compared to
  the prevailing Silicon Valley sentiment.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) timelines, the
  nature of technological acceleration, the limitations of current AI capabilities,
  and the necessary prerequisites for achieving broad economic transformation.** They
  contrast the concept of an "intelligence explosion" with a more complex, multi-faceted
  technological revolution akin to the Industrial Revolution.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **The "Intelligence Explosion" Analogy is Misleading:** The hosts argue that
  focusing solely on an "intelligence explosion" is like focusing only on "horsepower"
  during the Industrial Revolution. True transformation requires numerous complementary
  innovations across various sectors (finance, law, infrastructure), not just one
  core capability leap.

  *   **Capability Unlocks vs. Compute Scaling:** Progress in AI appears rapid because
  major capabilities (like sophisticated reasoning or coding) are unlocked periodically,
  often coinciding with large steps in compute scaling (e.g., 9-10 orders of magnitude
  since AlexNet). However, they suggest the remaining necessary unlocks (e.g., long-horizon
  agency, full multi-modality) might require significantly more compute scaling than
  the economy can easily sustain, or they might require fundamentally new innovations
  beyond current scaling laws.

  *   **The "Unhobbling" Hypothesis vs. New Capabilities:** They debate whether current
  models are "baby AGIs" that just need "unhobbling" (better context, agency scaffolding,
  post-training) or if entirely new, difficult capabilities must be engineered. They
  lean toward the latter, noting that while LLMs excel at knowledge retrieval (like
  answering Pokemon questions), they fail at executing complex, novel tasks within
  a dynamic environment (like playing an unknown Steam game).


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Longer Timelines for Full Automation:** Tamay predicts a drop-in remote worker
  replacement around **2045**, while Ege is slightly more bullish but still suggests
  timelines extending significantly beyond the common 2027-2030 predictions. This
  implies that the immediate economic disruption might be slower than anticipated
  by hyper-bulls.

  *   **Job Automation Nuance:** Many current tasks people perform are only a small
  fraction of their overall job. Automating that single task (e.g., booking a flight)
  does not automate the entire job, suggesting the fraction of the economy automated
  by AI is currently very small.

  *   **Revenue as a Proxy for Utility (Debated):** The discussion touches on whether
  massive revenue (e.g., OpenAI hitting $100B) is evidence of transformative intelligence.
  They caution that people pay trillions for non-transformative things (like oil),
  suggesting high revenue alone isn''t definitive proof of AGI readiness.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Ege Erdil & Tamay Besiroglu:** Founders of **Mechanize**, advocating for longer
  AGI timelines and a broader view of technological change.

  *   **Robin Hanson:** Mentioned as an example of someone whose extrapolation of
  current automation trends suggests centuries until full automation.

  *   **OpenAI:** Referenced regarding their potential $100B revenue milestone, which
  they see as a weak signal for AGI progress unless the figure is significantly higher
  (e.g., $500B).

  *   **WorkOS:** Mentioned in an ad break as a company helping software firms transition
  from consumer-grade products to enterprise-ready solutions (SSO, audit logs), highlighting
  the difficulty of building necessary infrastructure features.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that the path to AGI is **not a straight extrapolation
  of current LLM performance.** Significant, hard-to-predict breakthroughs in areas
  like **long-horizon agency, robust multi-modal integration, and general environmental
  interaction** (not just text-based reasoning) are still required. If these breakthroughs
  are as difficult as scaling compute constraints suggest, AGI remains decades away.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI researchers, venture capitalists, technology
  strategists, and technical professionals** interested in the fundamental drivers
  and realistic constraints shaping the AGI timeline, moving beyond hype cycles.'
