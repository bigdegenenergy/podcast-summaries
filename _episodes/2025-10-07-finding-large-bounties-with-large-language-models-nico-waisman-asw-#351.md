  topic: predictions
- impact_reason: Provides a specific technical insight into mitigating a major LLM
    weakness (hallucination/false positives) using a secondary verification mechanism
    ('validators').
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The product is very focused on having very low false positives. And we do
    that with a thing called validators, which is going to think of it as a second
    pair of eyes. When the LLM finds a vulnerability, we have this second pair of
    eyes that look at the finding, I would say, yes, this is a real vulnerability
    or not.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: A definitive statement confirming that the complex interaction, state
    management, and workflow navigation required for high-level bug bounty success
    were fully automated by the LLM.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: No, absolutely. There was no human helping in the process. It was all the
    LLM.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: Highlights the critical challenge of enabling LLMs to handle complex,
    stateful web application interaction (crawling, workflow navigation), which traditionally
    requires significant human expertise.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I was impressed to see an LLM climb up a bug bounty leaderboard to find vulnerabilities.
    What I thought more as part of my behind-the-scenes kind of questions is, how
    did you get the LLM to interact with the site very well? Because there absolutely
    is just an art to finding links, setting up a state, understanding workflows,
    business logic.
  topic: technical/AI application
- impact_reason: This is a powerful statement on how LLMs fundamentally solve the
    'discovery' problem in black-box testing by enabling natural, interactive browsing
    via headless browsers, mimicking manual security testing tools like Burp Suite.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: LLMs almost like fell out of heaven for us, because suddenly you have these
    models that can interact with a real browser and you can basically have what used
    to do with Burp, which is like browsing the website around and seeing the proxy
    getting slowly collecting all these data.
  topic: technical/breakthrough
- impact_reason: 'A counter-intuitive and highly impactful strategic view: reframing
    LLM hallucination from a bug to a feature, provided there is a robust, external
    validation mechanism (success criteria).'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We consider hallucination almost like a feature of the product. And I think
    that in general, if you are able to manage the context around the hallucination,
    if you have a very good success criteria, then hallucination plays on your side.
  topic: strategy/AI application
- impact_reason: 'Describes an ongoing adversarial arms race: as foundation models
    become more capable (''clever''), they become better at fooling security validators,
    necessitating continuous updates to the validation layer.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The better the LLMs are, they will come up with new tricks on how to make
    the validator tell that the vulnerability is real when it's not. And a lot of
    the work that we are doing is looking for the new models and seeing those corner
    cases and fixing those corner cases on the validator level because they're really
    clever.
  topic: AI security/arms race
- impact_reason: 'Identifies the current frontier for AI security testing: moving
    beyond simple pattern matching (like XXE) to complex, context-dependent vulnerabilities
    (Business Logic, IDOR), which requires deep application understanding.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But their other vulnerabilities are quite more interesting. And those are
    like the business logic, the IDOR or the authorization issues, then you need to
    have better context at them. Now, I think the LLMs are the right tool to do that,
    but they need to have a really good understanding of the application context.
  topic: AI limitations/future focus
- impact_reason: 'A clear prediction on the future division of labor: LLMs handle
    the routine 80% (OWASP Top 10), freeing humans for the high-value, creative 20%.'

    the bases, to the annoying part, and then take your human expertise and go deep
    into finding the more fun bugs, to be quite honest.'
  topic: predictions/future of work
- impact_reason: 'Presents a core strategy for mitigating LLM uncertainty: decomposing
    complex tasks (attack chains) into smaller, manageable ''unit tests'' for greater
    reliability.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What we do in terms of uncertainty is try to make the problems smaller. So
    rather than just telling like, this is an application, go on, find bugs, we try
    to transform that attack, especially the attack chain, into small unit tests.
  topic: technical/strategy
- impact_reason: Provides empirical insight into the exploration/exploitation trade-off
    in automated testing/AI agents. Initial steps are predictable, but true novelty
    (finding new vulnerabilities) emerges after sufficient exploration/iteration.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you generally run the same like either the same agent on one endpoint with
    certain parameters multiple times, I would say like the initial 10-20 tests of
    that are going to be very similar, and especially when they interact into the
    output and as they go, the interesting part happened after like the first 20 steps,
    and once it goes a little farther than that, and then it runs out of ideas, and
    then it comes out with like the most creative ideas that will end up like finding
    new vulnerabilities.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: 'This details the massive advantage of AI/automated testing: complete,
    granular, auditable traceability of every decision and action taken, solving the
    documentation burden of manual testing.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The good thing about AI penetration testing is that it's all built by a computer.
    So basically, what we do is like we collect everything that we do over the penetration
    test. We have every network packet that was sent and received from it from the
    attacker. We have all the actions that the LLM took, that includes like, you know,
    the reasoning of why the pen tester is performing an action, what is the action
    that is performed, and what is the output of the action.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: 'A powerful anecdote showing an unexpected, high-value use case for
    AI tools: generating foundational data assets (like API specs) when internal documentation
    is lacking, solving a real-world business problem beyond the initial scope.'

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And he was like, can you actually create an OpenAPI spec for me after all
    the findings you got? And I was like, why are you running that? It's because I
    don't have that data. Like the engineer had not put a good inventory of all our
    endpoints. And suddenly, I actually can help with that. I was like, I never expected
    that.
  topic: business

    remains an 'unsolved' problem because the input vector (natural language) is ubiquitous
    and unstructured.
  relevance_score: 10

    because as you mentioned earlier, you know, LLMs are essentially natural language,
    and natural language can appear everywhere, anywhere.

    security tools: using bug bounty results to refine the validator mechanism.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We went to bug bounty programs, kind of like experimented a little bit. Like
    we will go and we run some like validators and see if they work. And we start
    finding corner cases and improve them. And then we'll find more true positives,
    less false positives, and so on.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: 'Offers crucial business/operational advice for scaling AI testing:
    success depends as much on optimizing resource allocation (ROI) across massive

    the ROI, managing the return on investment because you have sources, if not millions
    of hosts out there.

    how did you get the LLM to interact with the site very well? Because there absolutely
    is just an art to finding links, setting up a state, understanding workflows,

  topic: technical

    moving from quantity (low-hanging fruit) to quality (rare, complex vulnerabilities
    like XXE), mirroring real-world penetration testing priorities.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We initially started with, let's get more points by looking at specific low-hanging
    fruit vulnerabilities at scale. Then we start focusing more on, okay, now that
    we reached that number, then we want it, now let's go and focus more on the quality
    type of vulnerabilities. The ones that are more rare to find, you will not easily
    find an XXE on a normal penetration test.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: 'Details a crucial technique for maximizing LLM utility in discovery:
    persistent, iterative prompting (''nudging'') beyond its initial inclination to
    stop, leading to novel, non-obvious findings.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We pushed the LLM to the limit on building a corpus to basically discover
    new endpoints. We constantly tell the LLM, go and find more endpoints, and then
    at some point it will try to give up, and you're like, no, don't give up. Continue
    with the process of coming out with new ideas of endpoints... we learned that
    the more you push, eventually we'll start finding so many interesting things that
    you will never know, and in any other corpus database that you have seen before.
  topic: technical/prompt engineering
- impact_reason: 'Provides the concrete mechanism for turning hallucination into discovery:
    the LLM proposes an endpoint, and the system validates its existence by attempting
    a connection, turning a guess into a potential finding.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So for example, you were mentioning, you were mentioning like discovery and
    how it will hallucinate endpoints that are not even there. If you're able to have
    a way where you can actually say, okay, you came up with an endpoint that you
    believe is real. I'm going to go and connect to that and see the response of that
    endpoint. Suddenly that hallucination is basically discovering new things.
  topic: technical/validation
- impact_reason: A striking anecdote illustrating how an LLM can invent a plausible
    but false context (a non-existent CVE) as part of its attack reasoning, yet this
    flawed reasoning path still led to the discovery of a *real*, unrelated vulnerability
    (XXE).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I'm going to go and search for that [CVE]. It didn't exist at all. There's
    no CVE at all... But the reality is like, after a couple of demos, I was like,
    you know, this CVE is interesting. I'm going to go and search for that. It didn't
    exist at all... But I mean, the hallucination was the initial step to discovering
    that on that specific endpoint, there was an XXE.
  topic: safety/hallucination
- impact_reason: 'Defines the core strength of LLMs in security testing: mimicking
    human-like cognitive steps in an attack chain (gather, try, refine, reflect, repeat).'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: LLMs are really good at following similar paths like a human. And that is
    like, they will gather information, they will try something, they will refine
    that attack that it made, they will reflect on it, and then they'll repeat it.
  topic: technical/AI application
- impact_reason: This vividly describes the iterative, self-correcting nature of advanced
    AI-driven attacks (like X-Bow), mirroring a human hacker's process of observation,
    refinement, and re-attempt based on error feedback. This highlights a key capability
    of LLMs in security testing.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Like we're constantly seeing that. Like, you can see the flow of the attack
    chain. And for example, that XXE example that I mentioned, it's a good example
    of that. Like when it's tried the initial XXE, you get that like an error saying,
    like, I cannot, I cannot parse these like file because it's not an XML when we
    try to like read like, et cetera password or when X-Bow will try to do that. And
    then X-Bow will say like, okay, I'm getting an error, but it's not, I'm not able
    to validate it because in order to validate it, you would be able to like download
    a file out of the system. And so it started this process of like, you know, coming
    out with a strategy and be like, okay, I'm going to try this. It fails, but I

    trigger that, knowing that that error message is there. And there's this like
    almost like an auto loop of like observing, refining, attacking, and so on.

    LLM performance by allowing it to map complex workflows, leveraging the LLM's
    natural language processing strength.

    you give a human why like you give them developer documentation, even could be
    a PDF for information, and it will read that document and then better understand
    the workflow of the tool itself so you can see like, you know, first app to use
    this API through login, then get this stuff, and then go and reach out this endpoint.
    If you provide that to the LLM, and this is the beauty of them, they can read
    natural language and act upon it.

    find your normal cross-site scripting, but look for like stored cross-site scripting,
    like, I don't know, like post-message kind of cross-site scripting, it will have
    more tools or ideas to go and find those vulnerabilities, especially with your
    like have a limited amount of tests that you can do. But then if you look for
    an IDOR, for example, just being very briefly and simple, sometimes it's better
    than just giving too much detail into the vulnerability.

    Internal red-teaming against prompt injection is necessary because the vulnerability
    is inherent to the technology's reliance on natural language.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I'm going to go and connect to that and see the response of that endpoint.
    Suddenly that hallucination is basically discovering new things. Obviously, when
    they find things that are not there, you get a 404, it's fine. Move on. But suddenly
    you will get a 200 OK or whatever it is for your one.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Finding Large Bounties with Large Language Models -
  Nico Waisman - ASW #351


  This episode of Application Security Weekly features Nico Waisman, CISO at Expo
  (Crossbow), discussing his company''s groundbreaking work using Large Language Models
  (LLMs) to automate and excel in bug bounty hunting, drawing parallels to the evolution
  of human penetration testing.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in offensive
  security, specifically within the context of bug bounty programs.** The discussion
  covers the technical implementation of LLM-driven vulnerability discovery, managing
  false positives, handling LLM "hallucinations," and the strategic implications of
  AI-powered penetration testing.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **LLMs for Discovery and Interaction:** The LLM agent was capable of complex,
  human-like interaction with web applications (using headless browsers) for discovery,
  including navigating workflows, understanding context, and autonomously generating
  novel endpoint discovery strategies beyond standard crawlers.

  *   **Managing Hallucination as a Feature:** Instead of viewing LLM hallucination
  (e.g., inventing non-existent endpoints or CVEs) purely as a flaw, the team leveraged
  it as a discovery mechanism. If a hallucinated endpoint returned a valid response
  (200 OK), it became a newly discovered attack surface.

  *   **The Validator System:** To combat false positives and the LLM''s attempts
  to "cheat" validation checks, a crucial "validator" system acts as a second pair
  of eyes. This system uses a headless browser to actively test the reported vulnerability
  (e.g., rendering JavaScript for XSS) against success criteria, ensuring only real
  findings are reported.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Accelerated Product Improvement:** Using public bug bounty programs provided
  Expo with immediate, real-world production environments to test their offensive
  product (X-Bow) against, drastically speeding up the feedback loop and product refinement
  process compared to traditional design partnerships.

  *   **ROI Optimization in Bug Bounties:** Success in bug bounty requires optimizing
  Return on Investment (ROI). This involved sophisticated fingerprinting of the attack
  surface to focus testing efforts only on hosts likely to yield unique, high-value
  findings, rather than wasting cycles on mirrored or staging environments.

  *   **Shifting Security Paradigm:** Waisman draws a parallel between convincing
  customers 20 years ago that pen testing was necessary and convincing them today
  that they must prepare for an era where AI tools can perform penetration tests at
  machine speed.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Nico Waisman (Expo/Crossbow):** The guest, highlighting his extensive background
  in security leadership (Lyft, GitHub) and offensive security (Immunity).

  *   **Expo (X-Bow):** The company developing the LLM-based offensive security product
  being discussed.

  *   **HackerOne:** The platform used by Expo to test their LLM agent against live
  bug bounty programs, where they achieved top rankings.

  *   **Daniel Stenberg (curl project):** Mentioned as a vocal critic highlighting
  issues with LLM-generated "slop" reports, providing context on the challenges of
  low-quality submissions.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests that LLMs will become integral to offensive security,
  moving beyond simple fuzzing to complex, multi-step attack chains that mimic human
  reasoning (gather information, attempt attack, reflect, refine). The industry is
  heading toward a future where security teams must defend against attacks generated
  and executed at machine speed, requiring automated validation and defense mechanisms
  capable of handling AI-driven creativity.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Application Security Professionals, Penetration
  Testers, Security Engineers, and Technology Leaders** interested in the practical
  implementation, strategic advantages, and inherent risks of integrating Generative
  AI into offensive security workflows.'
