  text: Bitcoin was the only market that was open. Crypto was the only market that
    was open. And so every single time that a geopolitical event or a macro event
    occurs during hours where the stock market is closed, there are a couple more
    people around the world who say, wait a second, why am I trading in a market where
    it is closed more hours a week than it is open?
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: Corrects the narrative that Bitcoin is a pure safe haven during immediate,
    breaking news events. It functions more as a highly liquid, available asset to
    sell for immediate cash/liquidity when panic strikes.

    crisis, right? But in the reaction to news, Bitcoin is a very, very liquid market.
    And because Bitcoin is a very liquid market, people panic. News breaks, sell.
    What do you sell? What''s liquid? What''s open? Bitcoin''s the only thing available
    to sell.'

    manipulated by hours of operation. It's manipulated by circuit breakers. It's
    manipulated in terms of how much algorithmic trading is going on there. Bitcoin
    is starting to get a lot more algorithmic trading, but it is still very much determined

    about their neighbor.

  text: Well, Bitcoin now, we grown up. That means we can get $10,000 candles in a

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Bitcoin’s $10K Candles Are Coming — Get Ready | Anthony
  & John Pompliano


  This 50-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast, featuring Anthony Pompliano and John
  Pompliano, centers on analyzing recent market volatility, particularly in Bitcoin,
  and arguing against the prevailing narrative of an imminent stock market crash.
  The core thesis is that massive, ongoing monetary intervention by the Federal Reserve
  has fundamentally changed market dynamics, favoring asset owners and creating a
  floor under asset prices.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion is heavily focused on **Cryptocurrency (specifically Bitcoin)** market
  structure, **Macroeconomics**, and **Investment Strategy** in the context of current
  geopolitical events and central bank policy.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin Liquidity Event:** The recent $19 billion liquidation event in Bitcoin,
  despite being severe on a percentage basis ($121k to $108k), was viewed as a healthy
  "clearing out of excess leverage," paving the way for higher prices.

  *   **24/7 Market Advantage:** Geopolitical events occurring outside of traditional
  stock market hours (like the Friday/weekend news cycle) highlight Bitcoin''s 24/7
  trading capability, driving more global interest as investors seek markets that
  are always open.

  *   **Maturation Stage:** Bitcoin is characterized as being in its "teenage years"—more
  mature than a toddler but not yet an "adult" asset (which they define as crossing
  a $10 trillion market capitalization threshold).


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Pessimism is Wrong:** The hosts argue that the widespread fear of a market
  bubble or crash is misplaced, noting that respected figures like Howard Marks are
  sounding less bearish. True bubbles burst when the skeptics capitulate, not when
  they are screaming "bubble."

  *   **Fed Put is Active:** The primary investment thesis is that the Federal Reserve
  will not allow a prolonged (18+ month) bear market or recession. Any significant
  market drop (e.g., 20% in stocks) will immediately trigger aggressive rate cuts
  and fiscal stimulus ("monetary bazooka").

  *   **Dollar Moves vs. Percentage Moves:** Investors are conditioned to focus on
  Bitcoin''s dollar movements (e.g., "$10,000 candles") rather than percentage changes,
  suggesting that as the asset grows, these dollar swings will become routine, even
  if the percentage move remains small (e.g., a $15k move being only 1%).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump:** Mentioned for his use of social media (specifically late Friday
  announcements) to influence market sentiment and engage in geopolitical negotiation
  tactics.

  *   **Jamie Dimon:** Cited as an example of a major financial leader acknowledging
  the current environment as a bull market.

  *   **Howard Marks (Oaktree):** Noted for his recent, relatively less pessimistic
  stance on current valuations, suggesting the market is not yet in a bubble territory.

  *   **Palantir:** Used as a prime example of modern corporate efficiency, where
  CEOs are now boasting about achieving high growth rates while *reducing* headcount,
  focusing on revenue per employee.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Monetary Manipulation:** The conversation heavily criticizes the current economic
  management strategy, stating that the Fed prioritizes preventing asset price collapse
  over maintaining the purchasing power of the US dollar. They claim 30% of the dollar''s
  purchasing power has been destroyed in five years due to these interventions.

  *   **Market Manipulation in Stocks:** Traditional markets are seen as manipulated
  by operational hours and circuit breakers, whereas Bitcoin is described as a "purer
  market" determined more by immediate human spot buying/selling in moments of fear.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward a future where asset prices are artificially supported
  by central bank intervention, making "buy the dip" a highly effective strategy for
  asset owners. This environment punishes those on the lower socioeconomic ladder
  while rewarding asset holders. Furthermore, the need for 24/7 trading will continue
  to drive adoption toward crypto markets.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Investors, Macro Strategists, and Financial Professionals** who need a
  contrarian view on current market health and an understanding of how central bank
  policy is overriding traditional valuation metrics.'
