    huge, right? Because a company really has, if you think about it, all the different
    stages of investment in it. You can have venture through their research and development

    range of the equity markets and trade every part of that ladder within a single

    automatic state changes (e.g., venture to growth, or activation of distress protocols)
    based on real-world data fed via Oracles.'

    And maybe some redesign that needs to happen, right? Because a lot of these blockchains
    use their native cryptocurrency to drive, you know, volume, right? And to try
    and make the platform ever more profitable in terms of how you purchase block
    space.
  topic: regulation/technology
- impact_reason: Proposes a concrete structural solution—token splitting (utility
    vs. investment)—to resolve the inherent conflict in single-token protocols.
  relevance_score: 10

    buy block space and an investment token to reflect the value of the overall blockchain
    and its treasury, right?
  topic: technology/innovation
- impact_reason: Identifies tokenomics clarity and transparency as a major blocker
    for institutional due diligence and investment in native crypto assets.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: institutions are still not clear on the tokenomics and how they work. I think
    they are still not clear, or I think that they realize that there is not a lot
    of clarity and transparency in some protocols in terms of what their tokenomics
    are and how they operate.
  topic: Regulation/Investment
- impact_reason: Provides a crucial conceptual framework for understanding tokens
    (ownership of open-source code) and explains why portfolio managers default to
    viewing them as risky early-stage tech equity.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: if you can get their mind around this idea that a token is not an equity,
    but a token is a way of sharing ownership of open-source code, that starts to

    but the general portfolio managers that all this sounds like too much like early-stage

    used bonds as just a fill-in for what could become a much more nuanced ecosystem
    around how do you create income in a portfolio?

    fund processes (documentation, valuation, capital calls) due to lack of existing
    industry standards.

    adding efficiencies and taking costs out of the private marketplace.

    ones.'

  text: But then at the opposite end of the spectrum, I think it is going to be the
    most liquid things that go to become tokenized first, and you are already seeing
    this, right? We talked about tokenization of equities, tokenization of ETFs.

- impact_reason: Identifies the creation of secondary market liquidity and the resulting
    NAV/token arbitrage as a key benefit of tokenizing illiquid assets.

  text: There is also, you know, there is no secondary market liquidity in a lot of
    these things. And, you know, at various points in the business cycle, people have
    got locked up in a VC fund or private equity fund, and they want to get liquidity.
    Yes, you can get some, but it is very illiquid. But, you know, it is going to
    create that, but then that creates, I guess, creates an arbitrage between the
    NAV versus the tokens, which is good because it creates liquidity around the ecosystem.

    actual investments in real estate.

    It is really only at best 15 years old. And so I think that we are still also

    the whole ecosystem growing, right? Not every token is necessarily suitable as
    an investment token.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: The Future Economy is Decentralized ft. Sandy
  Kaul


  This 72-minute episode of "The Journey Man" features Raoul Pal in conversation with
  Sandy Kaul, Head of Innovation at Franklin Templeton, focusing on the accelerating
  institutional adoption of blockchain technology and how tokenization is set to fundamentally
  rewire the global financial system, moving beyond simple crypto speculation into
  core infrastructure.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **institutional adoption and infrastructural transformation**
  driven by blockchain technology. Key themes include the tokenization of real-world
  assets (RWAs), the evolution of money market funds (MMFs) onto blockchain rails,
  the shift from traditional account-based finance to native wallet-based systems,
  and the future of personalized portfolio construction (direct indexing) in a tokenized
  environment.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Tokenized MMF Superiority:** Tokenized money market funds offer significant
  technical advantages over stablecoins, including native yield derived from a broader
  range of assets (not just Treasuries) and the ability to facilitate **second-by-second
  shareholder record-keeping** and **daily yield payout**, overcoming the traditional
  T+ settlement limitations.

  *   **On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Settlement:** Franklin Templeton is highlighted as
  one of the few firms building an **entire set of books and records on-chain**, allowing
  them to operate at the speed of digital rails, contrasting sharply with competitors
  whose tokenized assets still rely on off-chain settlement windows.

  *   **Portfolio as an Asset:** Tokenization allows individual security holdings
  within a portfolio to exist as tokens in a wallet. The entire portfolio can then
  become a **"token of tokens,"** which itself can be used as an asset—staked, pledged,
  or utilized for earning streams.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **MMF Market Disruption:** The US Money Market Fund market alone is valued at
  **$7 trillion**. Tokenization offers a superior, more efficient alternative to stablecoins
  for cross-border trade, supply chain financing, and treasurer use cases due to programmability
  and yield certainty.

  *   **Threat to Intermediaries:** Traditional financial intermediaries (like banks)
  face immense pressure as their account-based structures are challenged by native,
  wallet-based systems. Banks focusing only on tokenizing deposits are seen as taking
  a defensive, rather than truly innovative, approach.

  *   **Regulatory Headwinds for Stablecoins:** Recent regulatory moves (like MiCA
  and the US FIT21 Act) are specifically **forbidding stablecoins from paying yield**,
  potentially curtailing their utility as a primary cash management tool compared
  to tokenized MMFs which inherently carry yield.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Sandy Kaul (Franklin Templeton):** Positioned as a long-term thought leader
  who foresaw the tokenization shift back in 2017. FT is actively building custom
  infrastructure to operate as a "digital native" while maintaining its traditional
  firm status.

  *   **Franklin Templeton Tokenized MMFs:** Mentioned for both institutional (global
  cross-border trade) and retail offerings (accessible via an app for as little as
  $20, with Venmo-like P2P transfer capabilities).

  *   **Traditional Finance Institutions:** A general acknowledgment that major TradFi
  players are now "panicking" and accelerating their entry due to the realization
  that these blockchain rails are the future infrastructure.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The conversation notes a positive shift in the regulatory environment, citing **favorable
  tailwinds in DC**, the implementation of **MiCA in Europe**, and clarity emerging
  from Asia and the Middle East. However, new regulations are also seen as potentially
  limiting stablecoins (by banning yield) while providing clearer frameworks for registered
  products like tokenized MMFs.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving rapidly past the question of *if* crypto is viable toward
  *how* to integrate these rails. The future points toward **21st-century portfolios**
  that are highly personalized, tax-optimized, and composable, driven by tokenization.
  This shift will fundamentally change how collateral moves, how markets connect,
  and how institutions plug into open systems, rendering older, session-based regional
  markets obsolete.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Financial Professionals, Institutional Investors,
  Asset Managers, Fintech Strategists, and Crypto Infrastructure Builders** who need
  to understand the convergence of TradFi and decentralized technology at an operational
  and strategic level.'
