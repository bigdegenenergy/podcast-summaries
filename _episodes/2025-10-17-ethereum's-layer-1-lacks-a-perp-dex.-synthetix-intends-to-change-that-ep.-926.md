    by leveraging L1 liquidity directly, which is a major pain point for L2/sidechain
    DeFi.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: By removing the need to bridge off Ethereum and allowing people to just deposit
    margin into a contract that is running on the L1, we think that it will be far
    easier to attract liquidity and far easier to attract traders.
  topic: DeFi/Strategy
- impact_reason: A strong market observation suggesting that for high-stakes derivatives,
    L1 settlement/presence is crucial for liquidity attraction, challenging the L2-first
    narrative for all DeFi primitives.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The lesson from almost every perp dex is that it is very challenging to attract
    liquidity if you're on an L2 or a side chain or something like that. Probably
    the only perp dex that has actually pulled this off is Hyperliquid, and they're
    an L1.
  topic: DeFi/Investment
- impact_reason: Describes a novel hybrid architecture—borrowing the optimistic settlement
    concept from rollups but applying it to an order book—to achieve speed while maintaining
    L1 finality for margin.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What we're effectively building... is like an optimistic order book, if you
    want to think about it like that. So the order book itself, the order matching
    engine runs off-chain, but all of the orders are batched and settled onto Ethereum.
  topic: Technology/DeFi
- impact_reason: 'Introduces a significant philosophical debate in DeFi: transparency
    vs. privacy/security for traders. Hiding standing orders is positioned as a feature
    to prevent stop-hunting.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Standing orders will not be exposed. So you won't be able to see what, you
    know, what standing order, standing limit orders people have, except if it's in
    the book... we think is a feature and not a bug. You know, there's obviously arguments
    on both sides about like fully transparent or, you know, having some opacity to
    the order book and liquidations.

    diluting the value proposition of ETH as the primary asset and creating investor
    confusion.'

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The proliferation of L2 tokens changed the dynamic, I think, for investors
    where it wasn't as obvious that they should just buy ETH. And in fact, you know,
    there were a lot of people in various communities who said, you know, almost don't
    buy ETH, buy my token, my L2 token because we're the future sort of thing.

    high-value DeFi activity onto L1 to reinforce its dominance and security narrative.'

  text: Bringing all of that back to MainNet and running it efficiently on MainNet,
    I think is the optimal thing for reassuring everyone that Ethereum L1 is still
    the best place to build DeFi, which I personally still believe it is.

    mitigating counterparty risk, which remains a primary concern for large traders
    even when considering L1 congestion.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The thing that I think is the most concerning for almost every trader is counterparty
    risk. The risk of putting your assets on a centralized exchange, or through a
    bridge, or something like that.
  topic: defi/adoption
- impact_reason: A pointed critique of a perceived shift in DeFi protocol design philosophy,
    suggesting some projects prioritize tokenomics/speculation over core utility and
    user experience.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think the meta kind of changed, probably with GMX, where it became almost
    more important that the token of the project went up than that traders had a good
    experience.

    notional value dwarfs underlying asset liquidity, manipulation becomes economically
    viable.'

  text: Success is dangerous when it comes to building a perp Dex. And Synthetix has
    seen this as well, right? You know, one of our most, even before the perps, right,
    one of our most successful things was our spot derivatives. We had all these spot
    derivatives, and there were multiple instances where the size of the derivative
    versus, you know, let's say the market cap of the underlying asset got big enough
    that it became profitable for people to try to manipulate the underlying asset.

    right kind of waterfall of like ownership of trades from, you know, the individual
    trader down to some kind of vault-like system, you know, which we've built. And
    then eventually you get to ADL and then eventually you get to, you know, backstop

    you can lend, borrow, and trade, but not efficiently hedge.
  topic: defi/technology
- impact_reason: A candid admission of past ideological rigidity ('crazy idealists')
    that negatively impacted product adoption, serving as a cautionary tale about
    prioritizing purity over pragmatism in DeFi product design.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Back in the day, we used to use DAI before it became, you know, powered by
    USDC, right? And when USDC was at this collateral, Synthetix said, sorry, we're
    out. We won't touch DAI anymore. It's too centralized. Because we were crazy idealists,
    right? And we're like, it has to be purely decentralized or nothing, right? And
    I think that that lack of pragmatism definitely hurt Synthetix.
  topic: strategy/business
- impact_reason: 'Demonstrates a significant shift in mindset: prioritizing the superior
    trader experience (liquidity, availability) offered by USDT on Ethereum mainnet
    over strict decentralization ideals for the base settlement asset.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And so injecting a bit more pragmatism has been the right approach. Now, when
    we were making a decision about what the underlying collateral that denominates
    the exchange should be, and that they proposed to me that it would be Tether,
    there was a, you know, a theory emoji maxi, decentralization maxi. I was like,
    I don't know about this guys, but they were, you know, the engineers were able
    to convince me that like, especially on Ethereum mainnet, given how much USDT
    there is, it is the best possible asset you can use. If you're again optimizing
    for the trader experience, then you have to choose that.

    and you will win.

    the resulting fragmentation of the scaling landscape, a key theme in Ethereum
    scaling debates.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I pushed really hard for the Ethereum community to rally around a single L2,
    which was Optimism at the time. Unfortunately, it didn't go that way. And we ended
    up with 100 L2s, or at this point, it's probably 1,000.

    features.
  topic: Strategy
- impact_reason: Clearly articulates the necessary centralization trade-off (off-chain
    matching) required to achieve speed, while emphasizing that the critical financial
    security components (margin/liquidation) remain decentralized on L1.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The off-chain order matching system is a centralized service that's running,
    right? And so there is like this trade-off of you can't run it fully on-chain.
    So it can't be fully permissionless, but the margin and liquidation engines and
    all of the core infrastructure run on-chain.
  topic: Technology/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'A crucial insight into user behavior for high-frequency trading:
    speed of execution (matching) trumps immediate on-chain finality for margin monitoring.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The key insight is that the order matching is what people care about. They
    want their orders matched as quickly as possible. Once an order is matched...
    they don't really care about that part of the kind of trading engine as much,
    the margin side.

    which asset a potential investor should buy, right? The proliferation of L2 tokens
    changed the dynamic, I think, for investors where it wasn't as obvious that they
    should just buy ETH.
  topic: technology/investment
- impact_reason: A controversial but pragmatic take on Ethereum's current fee structure,
    suggesting L1 is intentionally underpricing block space to foster L2 growth, which
    is a strategic subsidy.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Ethereum should probably charge more for block space than it does. But at
    the moment, I think it's worth Ethereum kind of subsidizing the block space of
    L2s because that's where a lot of the activities are happening.
  topic: strategy/technology
- impact_reason: 'Identifies a critical technical and user experience challenge for
    L1-native DeFi applications (like perp DEXs) during periods of high congestion:
    friction in managing collateral/margin.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The main impact that you would have would be margin. The margin engine being
    on L1, being a contract that runs on Ethereum MainNet, would create potential
    issues for people either depositing or withdrawing margin, moving margin, et cetera,
    if gas prices spike and it is very expensive to deposit margin.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Ethereum''s Layer 1 Lacks a Perp Dex. Synthetix Intends
  to Change That - Ep. 926


  This episode of Unchained features Laura Shin interviewing **Kane Warwick**, founder
  of InfiNex and Synthetix, about the project''s strategic decision to launch a new
  **Perpetual Derivatives Decentralized Exchange (Perp Dex) directly on Ethereum Layer
  1 (L1)**, despite the historical challenges of L1 scalability.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** infrastructure, specifically
  the development and deployment strategy for high-frequency trading applications
  like Perp Dexes on Ethereum L1, contrasting this with the current landscape dominated
  by Layer 2 solutions and competing L1s.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Hybrid On-Chain/Off-Chain Architecture:** To overcome Ethereum''s 12-second
  block times, the new Synthetix Perp Dex will utilize an **off-chain order matching
  engine** (similar to an optimistic order book) for speed, while **all margin positions
  and settlements are batched and settled on Ethereum L1**.

  *   **L1 Margin Security:** A core design constraint is keeping user margin *on-chain*
  on L1. This eliminates the need for users to bridge assets off Ethereum, leveraging
  L1''s superior asset and stablecoin liquidity, though it introduces potential latency
  during high congestion events.

  *   **Partial Transparency Trade-off:** Unlike fully on-chain systems like Hyperliquid,
  standing limit orders will not be publicly exposed until they hit the book. Warwick
  views this partial opacity as a feature to prevent stop-loss hunting, though transparency
  of settled trades remains.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **The L1 vs. L2 Liquidity Battle:** Warwick argues that the combination of an
  L1 base layer and a Perp Dex is the optimal structure for attracting deep liquidity,
  citing the migration of competitors (like dYdX) away from L2s/sidechains.

  *   **Reasserting Ethereum L1 Dominance:** The move is a strategic effort to bring
  significant DeFi activity (like derivatives trading) back to Ethereum Mainnet, countering
  the fragmentation caused by numerous L2s and reassuring users that L1 remains the
  premier hub for DeFi.

  *   **Trader-Centric Design:** Synthetix prioritizes the trader experience (fast
  order matching and low counterparty risk) over immediate token appreciation, believing
  that retaining traders is fundamental to long-term platform viability.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Synthetix:** The project building the new L1 Perp Dex, leveraging six years
  of experience in derivatives infrastructure.

  *   **InfiNex:** Warwick''s related venture, suggesting a broader infrastructure
  play.

  *   **dYdX & GMX:** Mentioned as key competitors in the Perp Dex space, highlighting
  the current market saturation.

  *   **Hyperliquid:** Cited as a successful example of an L1-native Perp Dex.

  *   **High-Profile Traders:** The pre-launch involves a trading competition featuring
  prominent figures like **Ansem, Gains, and Dejan Spartan** to stress-test the system
  and generate initial attention.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No direct regulatory discussion occurred, but the emphasis on **counterparty risk
  mitigation** and keeping assets on L1 suggests an inherent preference for the censorship
  resistance and transparency offered by Ethereum over centralized or heavily bridged
  solutions.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a potential **re-consolidation of high-value DeFi activity
  back onto Ethereum L1**, provided that hybrid architectures can effectively manage
  the trade-off between L1 security/liquidity and the speed required for derivatives
  trading. The industry is moving toward specialized, high-performance applications
  built on the most secure base layer.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **DeFi professionals, infrastructure developers,
  crypto investors, and derivatives traders** interested in scaling solutions, L1
  vs. L2 strategy, and the competitive dynamics within decentralized perpetual trading.'
