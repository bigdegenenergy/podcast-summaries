    restriction on that share sold to somebody in this country kind of flow back to
    somebody in another country. So, you need to have some information about the characteristics
    of the investor, but not the actual person.

    with controls) to institutional comfort, arguing that this control layer makes
    them inherently safer for traditional finance integration than pure crypto.

  text: But in this world, because the assets are not better assets, it's actually
    a much safer world. And this is why institutions interact with RWAs, because the
    risks that they're taking are completely different levels.
  topic: adoption/investment
- impact_reason: Quantifies the perceived risk reduction for institutions when handling
    RWAs versus native digital assets (a drop from 90% theft risk to 10% level-up
    risk), providing a strong investment thesis point.

    when things are melting down, there's chaos, people getting liquidated, all these

    most and don't want to be interrupted the most while they're doing that.

    especially something like Bitcoin, and you are an institution and you're going

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Jesse Pollak on â€˜Base Is for Everyoneâ€™ + Guy
  Young and Carlos Domingo on Converge - Ep. 820


  This episode of Unchained features a deep dive with **Jesse Pollak**, Head of Base
  and Coinbase Wallet, focusing on the recent controversy surrounding the "Base Is
  For Everyone" coin launch on Zora. The latter part of the episode transitions to
  a discussion with **Guy Young and Carlos Domingo** regarding the Converge event.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area


  The primary focus is on **Web3 Creator Economy, On-Chain Marketing, and the cultural
  friction surrounding tokenization**, specifically using the Base ecosystem and Zora
  protocol as a case study. Secondary topics include the future of Coinbase integration
  with DEXs and the broader implications of tokenizing content versus traditional
  meme coins.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights


  *   **Coins as a Primitive for Content Value:** Pollak argues that "coins" (simple
  tokenization via Zora) are the most powerful tool for capturing the value of content
  and creativity, allowing creators to earn directly, contrasting with Web2 platforms
  that take the majority of the value.

  *   **Zoraâ€™s Protocol Shift:** Zora has shifted its platform to prioritize creating
  a coin with every post, moving away from the NFT-per-post model, signaling a broader
  industry trend toward simpler, more fluid tokenization for content.

  *   **Layered Value Accrual:** The future vision involves layered tokenization where
  a core asset (like a meme coin or a major piece of IP) can have economic relationships
  with every piece of derivative content created around it, driving attention and
  value back to the source.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle


  *   **Challenging Market Norms:** The Base incident highlights the tension between
  established "social standards" (e.g., don''t talk about price, don''t launch new
  coins) and the experimental nature required to build a new internet economy.

  *   **Coinbaseâ€™s "List Everything" North Star:** Coinbaseâ€™s long-term goal, driven
  by Brian Armstrong, is to integrate DEXs directly into the main Coinbase app, giving
  customers access to the entire global economy without the platform acting as a gatekeeper.

  *   **Content Value vs. Speculation:** The market reaction to the "Base Is For Everyone"
  coin demonstrated that users are actively trying to value on-chain content in real-time,
  even if the initial volatility leads to accusations of a "rug pull."


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People


  *   **Jesse Pollak (Base/Coinbase Wallet):** Central figure, defending the intentional
  use of coining content as a necessary experiment for creator monetization.

  *   **Zora:** The platform used for coining the content, whose shift to a coin-first
  model is seen as validating this approach.

  *   **Pump Fun (Alan):** Mentioned in the context of the cultural debate; Alan criticized
  Base for violating established social standards for launching tokens, to which Pollak
  retorted about conforming to "prescribed pump.fund trench standards."

  *   **Coinbase Leadership (Brian Armstrong):** Mentioned regarding the vision for
  listing all assets and integrating DEX functionality.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion


  *   **Insider Trading & Surveillance:** Pollak strongly denied any Coinbase employee
  involvement in the early purchase of the token, emphasizing Coinbase''s "most rigorous
  employee trading surveillance" and their history of reporting illicit activity to
  the government.

  *   **Cultural Toxicity and Safety:** Pollak stressed the need to foster **psychological
  safety** on Base so that developers and creators feel safe experimenting without
  facing immediate cultural attacks on platforms like X (formerly Twitter).


  ### 6. Future Implications


  The conversation suggests the industry is moving toward a future where **tokenization
  is ubiquitous for all digital output**, driven by the need to redirect value from
  platforms to creators. This transition will inevitably involve **cultural chaos
  and experimentation** (like the Base coin event) as the market works through established
  stigmas (like the negative perception of "coins") to find sustainable models for
  on-chain value accrual. The ultimate goal is a more open, creator-centric global
  economy.


  ### 7. Target Audience


  This episode is highly valuable for **Web3 Founders, Product Managers, Crypto Investors,
  and Developers** interested in the intersection of social media, creator monetization,
  L2 scaling (Base), and on-chain primitives (Zora/Coins).'
