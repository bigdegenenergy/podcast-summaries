summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Crypto In 2025, Is DAT Season Over & Market
  Outlook With Jordi Alexander


  This 18-minute episode features Felix (from Ford Guidance) interviewing Jordi Alexander,
  founder of Selini Capital, recorded live at the Origin Summit in Seoul, co-hosted
  by Blockworks and Story Protocol. The discussion centers on the current state of
  the crypto markets, the recent surge in Perpetual DEXs, the future of AI in Web3,
  and a surprisingly bearish take on the utility of DAOs.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus areas were the **current crypto market cycle dynamics** (challenging
  the traditional four-year halving cycle), the **Perpetual DEX war** (led by Hyperliquid),
  the potential for an **AI/Web3 resurgence**, and the **relevance and structure of
  Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Perp DEX Tokenomics Challenge:** A major difficulty for new and existing Perpetual
  DEXs (like Hyperliquid, Lighter, Aster) is balancing the need for exciting airdrops
  (to attract users) against the massive token selling pressure these emissions create,
  potentially devaluing the native token.

  *   **Web2/Web3 Bridging:** The next wave of significant innovation might come from
  applications that successfully integrate Web2 functionality with Web3 rails, such
  as tokenized video generation (like the work Everland is doing) or IP management,
  potentially creating the "next Polygon."

  *   **DAO Evolution:** Traditional DAOs are struggling because their treasuries
  are often locked, leading to a lack of appetite for their tokens. The evolution
  is towards "operational companies" or on-chain discretionary hedge funds attempting
  to generate sustainable revenue streams.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Market Cycle Skepticism:** Jordi Alexander is skeptical of the traditional
  four-year cycle due to massive TradFi intervention (e.g., $35T in debt allowing
  continuous printing), suggesting a true bear market is unlikely, but a significant
  "flush out" or reset is due following the recent altcoin tail-end momentum.

  *   **Perp DEX Opportunity:** Despite the risks of "catch-up farming," the Perp
  DEX category is large enough that secondary players (like Lighter) can still capture
  significant market share (trading volumes of $5B-$10B) even if Hyperliquid dominates.
  Airdrops can still be highly lucrative, potentially offsetting trading losses.

  *   **DAO Token Hangover:** Tokens associated with narratives that have already
  run up significantly (like some Solana-related entities) are facing a hangover effect
  where even excellent news (e.g., Binance integration) fails to move the price due
  to front-running and existing holders exiting positions.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordi Alexander (Selini Capital):** The expert guest providing market analysis
  and deep insights into the perp DEX space, where he has been heavily involved.

  *   **Hyperliquid:** Highlighted as the clear winner in the current cycle''s perp
  DEX narrative, but now facing challenges regarding future airdrops and token unlocks.

  *   **Lighter:** Mentioned as a strong competitor in the perp DEX space, focusing
  on zero fees and retail user flow. Jordi Alexander is an angel investor.

  *   **Story Protocol & Everland:** Mentioned in the context of the IP/AI theme,
  with Everland focusing on tokenizing generated video content.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched on the macro environment where **government entities are
  now engaging directly with crypto** (mining, DeFi), suggesting that a severe regulatory
  crackdown or deep bear market is unlikely because the system is becoming too integrated.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the market is entering a phase of **consolidation and
  dispersion**, moving away from broad-based excitement toward specific, execution-heavy
  narratives:

  1.  A likely short-term **liquidation cascade/reset** before Bitcoin potentially
  reasserts leadership based on gold''s strength.

  2.  The next major theme is likely **AI/Web3 integration**, requiring killer applications
  that bridge the two worlds.

  3.  **DAOs are functionally "over"** in their classic form, requiring a pivot toward
  sustainable, operational business models to retain value.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto/DeFi Professionals, Hedge Fund Managers,
  and Active Traders** who need nuanced takes on market structure, sector rotation
  (Perp DEXs vs. AI), and the long-term viability of on-chain governance models.'
