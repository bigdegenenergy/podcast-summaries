    as collateral: avoid covenants or triggers that force liquidation or dilution
    during price dips.'

    privilege' regarding the dollar.

    from (USD demand) and the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin (security/sovereignty
    outside US control).

    basically SoftBank make lots of big decisions. They have a lot of capital, and
    their backers are also sovereign in nature. So the thing that I feel is really
    important here that we cannot miss is the next wave of buyers that we're going
    to see in the space are going to look like this, where they're going to look like
    kind of quasi-private public partnership type models...

    for the long-term capital challenges faced by both Tether (asset inflation hedge)
    and Japan (yield starvation).

    where they've had negative rates for as long as they've had? I mean, if you think
    about one arbitrage at a global level you would find that would be where the money
    is. If you could find Japanese creditors to fund Bitcoin purchases, that is something
    that even Saylor will not have been able to accomplish with MicroStrategy thus
    far, having been generally an American vehicle of American investors.

    interest part of it.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why Twenty One Capital Is More About Volatility
  Than Bitcoin - Ep. 826


  This 75-minute episode of Unchained, hosted by Laura Shin, focuses on the launch
  of **21 Capital**, a new Bitcoin holding company backed by major players including
  **Tether, SoftBank, and Cantor Fitzgerald**. The discussion centers on how 21 Capital
  positions itself as a successor or evolution of the MicroStrategy (MSTR) model,
  but with potentially different strategic focuses, particularly around financial
  engineering and yield generation on the asset side.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **Bitcoin corporate treasury strategy** exemplified by
  MicroStrategy, and how 21 Capital intends to innovate upon this model. Key themes
  include **financialization of Bitcoin**, capital market instruments, the introduction
  of new performance metrics (BPS and BRR), and the potential for generating yield
  through Bitcoin-backed lending and other utility-focused applications.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Avoiding Liability Triggers:** A key learning from MicroStrategy’s experience
  is the danger of using capital instruments (like the Silvergate loan) that carry
  margin call triggers or onerous covenants, which create stock volatility during
  price drops. 21 Capital aims to structure its capital stack to be resilient to significant
  Bitcoin price declines.

  *   **Asset-Side Yield Generation:** Unlike MicroStrategy''s primary focus on liability
  engineering, 21 Capital emphasizes actively managing the *asset side* of its balance
  sheet, potentially through native lending models or using Bitcoin as collateral
  for capital market functions (e.g., margin for derivatives trading) to earn incremental
  yield beyond simple HODLing.

  *   **Bitcoin Security Model Evolution:** There is a recognition that the long-term
  security of Bitcoin may eventually depend on income-generating activities beyond
  block rewards, prompting discussion about channeling energy into developing utility
  like the Lightning Network, even if current economics remain unclear.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Volatility Monetization:** The core investment thesis discussed is that investors
  buying into these Bitcoin holding companies (like 21 Capital at a high premium)
  are primarily buying a **volatility monetization scheme**, not just an earnings
  scheme. The stock price reacts more to the volatility of the underlying asset than
  to traditional earnings reports.

  *   **KPI Clarity is Crucial:** The introduction of metrics like **Bitcoin Per Share
  (BPS)** and **Bitcoin Return Rate (BRR)** is seen as necessary to bridge the gap
  between crypto accumulation and Traditional Finance (TradFi) investor understanding,
  allowing for measurable progress on the treasury strategy.

  *   **Risk of Lending Models:** While yield generation is a goal, the 2022 crypto
  lending collapses (Celsius, Voyager, etc.) highlight the extreme risks associated
  with counterparty risk and underwriting in this space. Any lending strategy must
  prioritize robust over-collateralization.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **21 Capital:** The new entity formed by Tether, SoftBank, and Cantor Fitzgerald,
  aiming to be a pure-play Bitcoin hyper-financialization vehicle.

  *   **MicroStrategy (MSTR) / Michael Saylor:** The established benchmark for corporate
  Bitcoin accumulation, whose strategies (both successes and perceived mistakes) 21
  Capital is learning from.

  *   **Jack Mallers (Strike Founder):** Highlighted as the leader of 21 Capital,
  bringing a younger, more optimistic, and utility-focused vision compared to Saylor''s
  inflation-fighting narrative. His background in commodities trading is also noted.

  *   **Cantor Fitzgerald:** Their involvement suggests a focus on bridging TradFi
  capital markets friction with crypto-native operations.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion did not delve deeply into specific regulations but touched upon the
  **political and capital element** of major institutional players (Tether, SoftBank)
  converging on Bitcoin, symbolizing a significant global shift in capital alignment
  around the asset.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is moving toward **hyper-financialization
  of Bitcoin** via corporate structures. We will likely see more experimentation with
  different coin vehicles and a greater focus on developing utility (like DeFi or
  lending) on top of Bitcoin to secure its long-term security model and provide non-store-of-value
  benefits. The generational difference between Saylor and Mallers suggests a shift
  in the dominant narrative surrounding Bitcoin adoption.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto and TradFi Investment Professionals,
  Hedge Fund Managers, Corporate Strategy Officers, and Analysts** tracking the institutional
  adoption and financial engineering surrounding Bitcoin.'
