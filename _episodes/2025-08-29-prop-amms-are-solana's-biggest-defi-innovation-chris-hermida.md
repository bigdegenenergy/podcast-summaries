    structure where the majority of sort of retail trading flow on Solana has been
    going through the aggregators, and primarily Jupiter Swap.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: 'This is the core technical differentiation: contrasting the reactive
    pricing of traditional AMMs (based on internal pool ratios) with the external,
    real-time pricing of Oracle AMMs.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Traditional AMMs... based on the last trade that happened in that pool of
    assets... Whereas prop AMMs or Oracle AMMs... use oracles. So the price discovery
    probably happens on Binance and as quickly as you can sort of pipe the latest
    price in is how quickly you can price these assets.

- impact_reason: A strong prediction that this market structure evolution is not Solana-specific
    but will become the standard for large, liquid assets across all major DeFi ecosystems.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think it's an evolution that has kind of uniquely really taken over on Solana
    just because of the nature of aggregators on Sol. It's also something that, you
    know, I think is going to happen on pretty much every other DeFi ecosystem and
    chain just because of the nature of market structure around large liquid assets.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: Identifies DEX aggregators (like Jupiter on Solana) as the crucial
    infrastructure layer that unlocks the efficiency of advanced AMM models (prop/oracle
    AMMs) for the end-user.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The rise of really Jupiter and aggregators that have allowed people to plug
    in these Oracle and some prop AMMs has really been what's enabled that more competitive,

    on some of these stuff. It's for new assets, particularly launchpad meme coins
    where they're just so volatile and primary price discovery is happening on those
    launchpads, it doesn't make sense as a product there because you don't really
    have a reference point elsewhere.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Prop AMMs Are Solana''s Biggest DeFi Innovation
  | Chris Hermida


  This 57-minute episode of *Light Speed* features Chris Hermida, co-founder of Switchboard,
  discussing the rise and significance of **Proprietary Automated Market Makers (Prop
  AMMs)**, which he prefers to call **Oracle AMMs**, on the Solana blockchain. The
  conversation centers on how this market structure innovation is fundamentally changing
  on-chain trading efficiency and liquidity provision.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market structure innovation**,
  specifically the evolution of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) on **Solana**. The
  discussion contrasts traditional AMMs with Oracle/Prop AMMs, examining their technical
  underpinnings, competitive advantages, and impact on liquidity providers (LPs) and
  retail traders.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Oracle AMM Mechanism:** Prop AMMs differ from traditional AMMs (like early
  Uniswap) by using **oracles** (like Switchboard or Pyth) to price assets based on
  external, off-chain price discovery (e.g., Binance). This makes them "reactive"
  rather than purely "reactive" to the last on-chain trade.

  *   **Mitigation of Adverse Selection:** By using external pricing, these AMMs allow
  liquidity providers to quote tighter spreads and are less susceptible to adverse
  selection (toxic flow) compared to passive liquidity in traditional AMMs, leading
  to better capital efficiency for LPs.

  *   **Solana-Specific Advantage:** The dominance of aggregators like **Jupiter**
  on Solana has been crucial. Aggregators route retail flow to the best execution
  venue, allowing Prop AMMs—which offer superior pricing for large, liquid pairs—to
  capture significant order flow by plugging directly into these routers.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Tighter Spreads for Retail:** The net result for the average retail user is
  often tighter spreads and better execution prices on Solana for major pairs (like
  SOL/USDC) compared to centralized exchanges, indicating a highly efficient on-chain
  market for these assets.

  *   **Attraction of Trading Firms:** The massive on-chain volume on Solana naturally
  attracts sophisticated trading firms and market makers who seek to provide liquidity
  and capture flow, often bringing traditional HFT secrecy and expertise into the
  DeFi space.

  *   **Future Expansion to RWAs:** This infrastructure is seen as critical for bringing
  deep, efficient on-chain liquidity to Real World Assets (RWAs) where price discovery
  predominantly occurs off-chain in traditional finance.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Chris Hermida (Switchboard):** Guest and expert on oracle infrastructure and
  Solana market structure.

  *   **Jupiter Swap:** Highlighted as the dominant aggregator on Solana, acting as
  the essential gateway for Prop AMMs to access retail order flow.

  *   **SOLFi (Ellipsis Labs):** Mentioned as one of the first and most successful
  Prop AMMs, demonstrating deep technical expertise in Solana market infrastructure.

  *   **Kamino, Orca, Raydium, Meteora:** Mentioned as key players in the evolving
  Solana DEX landscape.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched upon the **secrecy culture** adopted by the teams behind
  these successful Prop AMMs. This secrecy, similar to traditional HFT firms, is partly
  driven by the desire to protect a competitive edge and potentially mitigate regulatory
  risks associated with operating highly efficient trading venues.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests that **Oracle AMMs are the future standard for
  trading large, liquid assets** across all major DeFi ecosystems, not just Solana.
  As more chains mature, this market structure will likely be replicated elsewhere
  to provide superior execution quality by linking on-chain liquidity to off-chain
  price discovery.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **DeFi professionals, blockchain developers, crypto
  investors, and market structure analysts** interested in the technical evolution
  of on-chain trading and the competitive dynamics within high-throughput ecosystems
  like Solana.'
