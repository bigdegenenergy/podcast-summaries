summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: You Won''t BELIEVE What The BRICS Are Planning!!


  This 19-minute episode, hosted by Guy from Coin Bureau, focuses on the dramatic
  geopolitical shifts occurring as major non-Western powers—specifically **India,
  China, and Russia (BRICS/SCO members)**—actively decouple from the US dollar-centric
  global financial and security architecture following recent US trade actions against
  India.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Geopolitics and De-Dollarization**, specifically analyzing
  how US foreign policy (tariffs and sanctions) is inadvertently strengthening the
  BRICS/SCO alliance and accelerating the creation of alternative, dollar-free payment
  and security systems. While the podcast is from Coin Bureau, the discussion centers
  on macroeconomics, international relations, and the infrastructure supporting alternative
  trade, rather than specific crypto/Web3 technical details.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Activation of Alternative Payment Rails:** The US tariff on Indian goods acted
  as a catalyst, forcing the immediate operationalization of long-planned **rupee-to-ruble
  and rupee-to-yuan payment mechanisms** for energy and trade, bypassing the dollar
  system.

  *   **CIPS Expansion:** China’s **Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS)**
  is actively facilitating dollarless transactions between Moscow, New Delhi, and
  Tehran, providing a functional alternative to SWIFT for sanctioned or trade-disrupting
  nations.

  *   **Energy Pricing Shift:** The impending **Power of Siberia Two pipeline** deal
  between Russia and China is explicitly structured to be priced *only* in **Rubles
  and Yuan**, marking a significant step away from dollar-denominated commodity pricing.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Tariffs as De-Dollarization Accelerant:** The episode argues that recent US
  tariffs (like the 50% tariff on India) have done more to push nations toward de-dollarization
  than years of BRICS summit declarations, as the immediate pain forces activation
  of existing workarounds.

  *   **Shifting Trade Routes:** Indian exporters, hit by US tariffs, are rapidly
  redirecting $6 billion in annual trade toward Brazil, Russia, and Southeast Asia,
  utilizing new non-dollar payment systems.

  *   **Risk of US-China Escalation:** The market is keenly watching the November
  10th deadline for potential **145% tariffs on China**. If enacted, this would severely
  impact $500 billion in US-China trade, though China’s growing domestic market may
  mitigate the impact on Beijing more than it would on the US supply chain.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Narendra Modi (India):** Executed a masterful "multi-alignment" strategy,
  deepening ties with China (SCO summit) and Russia (oil deals) immediately after
  being penalized by the US, while simultaneously maintaining ties with Japan (investment)
  and the Quad (security).

  *   **Xi Jinping (China) & Vladimir Putin (Russia):** Solidified their strategic
  partnership, highlighted by the advancement of the Power of Siberia Two pipeline
  deal.

  *   **SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organization):** Presented its vision of "indivisible
  security," directly challenging the premise of Western military blocs like NATO.

  *   **China''s New Development Bank:** Mentioned as a viable alternative source
  of development finance ($50 billion capital) for nations facing Western restrictions,
  contrasting sharply with the IMF/World Bank structure.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The core policy discussion revolves around the **failure of US economic coercion**
  (tariffs and sanctions) to enforce loyalty. The episode contrasts the effectiveness
  of US threats against Britain in 1956 (where the threat of dumping bonds caused
  collapse) with the current situation, where India absorbed the tariff and immediately
  sought alternative partners. The policy implication is that the US has lost its
  monopoly on financial leverage because alternative infrastructure now exists.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future defined by **multipolarity and parallel economic
  systems**. The success of India’s response to tariffs indicates that major economies
  can now actively pursue strategic autonomy by leveraging non-Western financial and
  security partnerships (BRICS/SCO). The industry is heading toward a bifurcation
  where trade between aligned blocs will increasingly occur outside the dollar system.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Geopolitical Analysts, Macro Investors, Trade
  Policy Professionals, and individuals interested in the long-term strategic implications
  of De-Dollarization** within the broader financial and technology sectors.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast episode details a significant pivot in global alignment, triggered by
  recent US trade actions against India. The narrative begins with the optics of the
  Beijing military parade featuring Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong-un, symbolizing
  a strong anti-Western axis.


  The central catalyst discussed is the **50% tariff imposed by the US on Indian exports**—ostensibly
  for buying cheap Russian oil—which India viewed as "economic blackmail." This punitive
  action backfired spectacularly. Instead of capitulating, Indian Prime Minister Modi
  immediately leveraged the situation to deepen ties with US rivals. He attended the
  **Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit**, publicly declaring India-China
  relations should not be viewed through a "third country lens," and reaffirmed strong
  ties with Putin, all while continuing to purchase Russian energy. This demonstrated
  a highly effective "multi-alignment" strategy, balancing US military contracts with
  Russian energy and Chinese trade.


  Simultaneously, the episode highlights concrete steps toward **de-dollarization**.
  The tariff shock accelerated India’s implementation of **rupee-based payment systems**
  for oil trade with Russia. Furthermore, Russia and China finalized negotiations
  on the **Power of Siberia Two pipeline**, which will exclusively use **Rubles and
  Yuan'
