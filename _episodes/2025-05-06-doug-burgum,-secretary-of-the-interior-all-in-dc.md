    hey, we've got to have a policy because if we don't, if we don't have energy security,
    we're not going to have national security. And that's what really drove, sort
    of, this sitting here right now today. So you ran for president, you ran for the
    Republican nomination against President Trump and others, and then obviously President
    Trump got that nomination. Did you keep in touch with him after that? And how
    did you kind of work with his staff and his office as he was moving his campaign
    forward? Well, we were in touch because we knew each other as a governor would
    know a president. But I was never really running against President Trump. And
    I think the record shows that I was really running against these horrifically
    dangerous and unsound, unsafe policies of the Biden administration, which are
    almost too numerous to enumerate. And the first office, last December 15th, just
    December 15th of 2024, as governor, I was involved in 30 lawsuits against the
    Biden administration. Many of them, including against the agency, the bureaus
    that I'm now leading, because the regulatory regime was such that it wasn't about
    regulating oil and gas. It was about eliminating oil and gas from America. And
    if there was some sort of false god around climate ideology that was being chased,
    it was like, oh, if we stop the supply coming from the US, we're going to somehow
    save the planet. But there was no reduction of demand. The demand was just being
    filled by Iran, Venezuela, Russia. And they were funding wars against this. So
    I thought it was the closest thing to insanity that I'd ever seen. And so when
    we dropped out very quickly, I was the first of any of the other candidates to
    endorse President Trump and then spent last year campaigning for him. And then
    there was, can I say this, some rumors that you might have been in the running
    for Vice President, but you obviously stayed close with the president and his
    staff and found your way into this role. How did that process go for you? How
    did you end up in this role? Well, it's a love what I'm doing and I love the role.

    they were funding those wars against us with their oil and gas sales. And so if
    we can replace their customers with US sources, they have less revenue. They have

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Doug Burgum, Secretary of the Interior | All-In
  DC


  This 51-minute episode of *All-In DC* features an in-depth interview with **Secretary
  of the Interior Doug Burgum**, conducted on-site at the Cheniere LNG export facility
  in Sabine Pass, Louisiana. The discussion centers on the critical intersection of
  **American energy dominance, national security, the impact of AI on energy demand,
  and the regulatory environment.**


  ---


  **1. Focus Area:**

  The primary focus is **Energy Policy and National Security**, specifically advocating
  for **American Energy Dominance** through increased domestic production of natural
  gas (LNG), oil, and critical minerals. A major secondary theme is the **massive,
  underestimated energy demand driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced
  manufacturing**, contrasting US capacity growth with China''s rapid expansion.


  **2. Key Technical Insights:**

  *   **LNG as a Global Solution:** The Cheniere facility exemplifies the shift from
  planning to import LNG to becoming the world''s second-largest exporter of methane.
  Methane is highlighted as a transportable fuel with a lower carbon footprint than
  alternatives used elsewhere.

  *   **Grid Stability Requires Baseload Power:** The conversation strongly critiques
  the over-reliance on intermittent renewables (wind/solar), citing the recent grid
  failures in Spain after shutting down coal plants. It emphasizes that stable grids
  require reliable **baseload power** (like natural gas or nuclear) to maintain voltage
  and amperage.

  *   **AI''s Energy Hunger:** The tech sector, historically consuming only 1% of
  US electricity, is now driving unprecedented demand. The five largest tech companies
  are committing hundreds of billions in CAPEX specifically for power infrastructure
  to fuel AI data centers.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle:**

  *   **Energy as a Geopolitical Tool:** Replacing energy sales from adversaries (like
  Russia and Iran) with US production directly impacts their ability to fund conflicts,
  linking energy exports to **peace abroad and prosperity at home.**

  *   **Tech CAPEX Shift:** The traditional tech model of low capital expenditure
  is obsolete; major tech firms are now showing up at energy conferences with massive
  CAPEX plans, signaling a fundamental shift in investment focus toward power generation.

  *   **Regulatory Barrier to Capital:** Current regulatory regimes make it nearly
  impossible for new baseload fossil fuel projects to secure permits, which subsequently
  blocks access to capital and insurance, stifling necessary energy expansion.


  **4. Notable Companies/People:**

  *   **Doug Burgum:** Secretary of the Interior and Chair of the National Energy
  Dominance Council. His background as a tech entrepreneur (Great Plains Software,
  acquired by Microsoft) and Governor of North Dakota heavily informs his policy views.

  *   **Cheniere Energy:** The host company, operating the largest LNG export facility
  in the US, showcasing the success of the shale revolution.

  *   **China:** Identified as the primary competitor in the AI arms race, rapidly
  adding the equivalent of five new "Americas" in electricity production capacity,
  largely through coal.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  *   Burgum frames the Biden administration''s policies as a **"war on extraction"**
  (oil, gas, coal, minerals) driven by "climate ideology," which he argues was effectively
  an attempt to eliminate US fossil fuels rather than reduce global demand.

  *   The administration''s regulatory actions are cited as the primary reason for
  the US grid''s inability to add capacity efficiently over the last 35 years.

  *   The **National Energy Dominance Council** is tasked with breaking through regulatory
  logjams to unlock US energy potential to meet the AI-driven demand curve.


  **6. Future Implications:**

  The conversation suggests the US is at a critical inflection point where **losing
  the AI arms race due to insufficient power capacity is a greater existential threat
  than incremental climate change.** The future requires a "Manhattan Project-style"
  mobilization to rapidly deploy all forms of energy—including fossil fuels, nuclear,
  and renewables—to meet exploding demand, while betting on long-term innovation to
  solve future environmental challenges.


  **7. Target Audience:**

  This episode is highly valuable for **Energy Sector Professionals, Technology Executives
  (especially those involved in AI/Data Centers), Policy Analysts, and Investors**
  focused on infrastructure, commodities, and geopolitical risk.'
