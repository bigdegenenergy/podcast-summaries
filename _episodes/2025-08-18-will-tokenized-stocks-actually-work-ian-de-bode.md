    tokenized assets: maintaining price parity (the peg) with the underlying asset.'

    we can immediately execute off-chain if we're the same amount and mint the asset
    so that there's clear connectivity between the off-chain liquidity pools and on-chain
    liquidity pools. Our assets will not be de-pegged.

    stance favoring on-chain innovation to maintain global financial dominance, contrasting
    with previous administrations.

  text: Under the previous administration, I would have said, yes, you are correct
    [regulators won't let you do this]. Luckily, this administration has taken a different
    approach and has clearly taken the view that the US should lead in on-chain innovation
    and really solidify the position of the US dollar in the on-chain economy.

    solving for 24/7 redemption liquidity back into stablecoins is non-negotiable
    for user adoption.'

    the redemption liquidity in particular. People want to be able to invest in a
    tokenized Treasury asset, park their cash, but then immediately be able to transfer
    back into stablecoins.

    accounts to money market funds in TradFi, predicting a similar migration from
    non-yielding stablecoins to yield-bearing tokens in crypto.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think the real layers are quite fearful of that for good reason, but you
    start to see the same thing happen in traditional banking from checking to money
    market funds. I think the same thing is going to play out with stablecoins where
    over time you're going to see migration from stablecoins into these yield coins.

    poor User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) and the complexity of non-custodial
    asset management compared to familiar Web2 platforms.'
  relevance_score: 10

  text: If 10 years from now tokenization doesn't happen, what's the most likely reason
    it didn't happen? ... the key thing that the space wasn't able to figure out is
    just the UI/UX, the holding of the assets in non-custodial accounts and the like,
    just an inability to provide for a better experience ultimately than the traditional
    version.

    accessibility and DeFi integration/collateralization.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We believe tokenization is also for two things. Number one is enabling global
    access to an asset that people want but historically have struggled to get access
    to. The second reason is tokenization enables you to put something on-chain. Why
    do people want their asset on-chain? Because they can also use it in DeFi, primarily
    as collateral.

- impact_reason: 'Presents a strong investment thesis: tokenizing access to high-performing
    US markets will be a major engine for global wealth redistribution.'
  relevance_score: 9

    most other, almost any other capital market out there. So, giving access to US
    capital markets to a global audience is, we believe, a real driver of global wealth
    creation in the future.

    of a direct, real-time link between centralized exchange liquidity and on-chain
    DEX liquidity pools.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The 420 price really is set on these centralized exchanges like NASDAQ and
    the like, because that's where the trading happens. But then you've got these
    on-chain assets that in some models out there rely on different liquidity pools...
    There's no connection between the two. And so, as a result, the price that happens
    on-chain... can drift up.

    crucial challenge of building robust, connected liquidity infrastructure.

    to OUSG... but we wanted to structure USDY in a way that it had the best bankruptcy
    investor protections and bankruptcy remoteness, and we wanted it to be easier

    and potential upgrade path.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We pay 4.29% out on a daily basis to everyone who holds it [USDY]. So, in
    that sense, I would say it is a superior product to a stablecoin in this sense
    that it still has better investor protections and it pays out yield on a daily
    basis.

    yield-bearing, protected assets distributed to users are superior to non-yielding
    alternatives.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I do believe fundamentally that a yield coin probably is a better form of

    even for sophisticated US investors by unifying fragmented brokerage environments,
    similar to how stablecoins improved cash movement.

  text: Even in the US, the landscape is very fragmented. Brokerage looks different

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Will Tokenized Stocks Actually Work? | Ian De Bode (Ondo
  Finance)


  This 31-minute episode features a deep dive with Ian De Bode, Chief Strategy Officer
  at Ondo Finance, exploring the viability, technical challenges, and market potential
  of tokenizing traditional assets, specifically focusing on stocks and ETFs. The
  host plays the role of a skeptical devil''s advocate to extract the "cold, hard
  truth" about the technology.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**:

  The primary focus is **Web3/Crypto infrastructure applied to TradFi**, specifically
  the tokenization of traditional securities (stocks and ETFs). Key themes include
  asset programmability, global market access, DeFi integration, and the critical
  technical hurdle of maintaining price pegging between on-chain tokens and off-chain
  assets.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Programmability & Utility:** Tokenization''s core value is enabling **programmability**
  and **24/7 movement** of assets on-chain, making them a "better version" of the
  traditional asset, particularly for use as collateral in DeFi.

  *   **The Pegging Problem:** The biggest technical failure point for current tokenized
  stocks is **de-pegging**. This occurs due to a disconnect between on-chain liquidity
  pools (like DEXs) and the centralized off-chain exchanges (like NASDAQ) where the
  true price is set, necessitating robust, real-time arbitrage/mint/burn connectivity.

  *   **Treasury Fund Evolution:** Ondo''s journey from permissioned tokenized Treasuries
  (OUSG) to permissionless, yield-bearing stablecoins (USDY) provided crucial learnings
  on managing redemption liquidity and integrating assets into broader DeFi protocols,
  which are now being applied to equities.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Global Access Driver:** Tokenization is positioned as a major driver for **global
  wealth creation** by granting international investors easy access to the superior
  returns of US capital markets, bypassing local currency risks and capital controls.

  *   **Enhanced US Investor Utility:** Even for US investors, tokenization offers
  significant improvements over fragmented brokerage accounts, enabling **interoperability**
  between platforms and easier access to dynamic margin shopping across DeFi ecosystems
  24/7.

  *   **Uncertainty in Use Cases:** The market structure is TBD; it is unclear whether
  tokenized assets will primarily be used for conservative buy-and-hold strategies
  or more aggressive, on-chain-native activities like trading perpetuals on volatile
  assets (e.g., MicroStrategy).


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Ian De Bode (Ondo Finance):** CSO, leading the development and strategy for
  tokenizing assets, including their successful USDY stablecoin and upcoming equity
  tokenization efforts.

  *   **Robinhood, Coinbase, Kraken:** Mentioned as major players signaling growing
  institutional interest in the tokenized stock space.

  *   **BlackRock:** Mentioned as the current leader in tokenized Treasury products
  (Biddle fund), whose structure was partially mirrored by Ondo''s earlier OUSG product.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   **US Regulatory Stance:** The current US administration is viewed as being more
  favorable toward on-chain innovation, seeing it as a way to **solidify the dominance
  of the US dollar and US capital markets** globally, similar to the push for stablecoin
  legislation.

  *   **Investor Protection Focus:** Regulators remain highly concerned with investor
  protection, requiring tokenized assets to be designed to be **bankruptcy remote**
  and ensuring clear redemption pathways.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  The conversation suggests that tokenization, if the pegging problem is solved, will
  lead to a **superior, interoperable version of traditional brokerage accounts**.
  Furthermore, yield-bearing stablecoins (like USDY) are seen as a potentially superior
  product to non-yielding stablecoins, mirroring the growth of money market funds
  over traditional checking accounts in the US banking system.


  **7. Target Audience**:

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto/Web3 professionals, TradFi innovators,
  asset managers, and institutional investors** interested in the practical implementation
  and market structure of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization.'
