    persona that we can build products around? And I''m going after that market. In

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Building the Internet of Agents with Vijoy Pandey -
  #737


  This episode features Vijoy Pandey, SVP and GM of Outshift by Cisco, discussing
  the concept of the **Internet of Agents** as the necessary platform for future agent-to-agent
  collaboration, moving beyond current siloed LLM applications.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **Internet of Agents (IoA)**: defining it as an open, interoperable,
  and quantum-safe platform for enabling complex, multi-agent workflows within the
  enterprise. The discussion centers on the transition from deterministic computing
  (traditional APIs/SaaS) to **probabilistic computing** driven by agentic systems,
  and the challenges and opportunities this presents for enterprise integration and
  IT operations.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Agentic Abstraction Layer:** The shift from cloud computing to agentic computing
  represents a higher level of abstraction, aiming to offload human toil (decision-making,
  data parsing, code generation) to autonomous agents.

  *   **Four Phases of Agent Collaboration:** The IoA platform must address four critical
  stages: **Discovery & Identity** (finding agents and verifying trust), **Composability**
  (stitching agents into workflows), **Deployment** (scaling the workflow), and **Evaluation**
  (measuring the probabilistic outcomes and governance).

  *   **Semantic vs. Syntactic Communication:** A major technical gap is the lack
  of standards for the **semantic layer** (defining what terms like "best" or "90%
  confidence" mean across different vendor agents), which is more critical than the
  current focus on syntactic communication protocols (like A2A, MCP, ACP).


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Cisco''s Strategic Entry Point:** Outshift positions Cisco to enter high-risk,
  emerging markets like agent platforms, reducing overall organizational risk by incubating
  these ventures internally before broader adoption.

  *   **Eliminating IT Toil:** Agentic systems promise massive efficiency gains. The
  "SRE Jarvis" example showed eliminating the work of three full-time engineers in
  support and reducing the time for complex configuration tasks (e.g., setting up
  new LLMs or EC2 instances) from days to minutes for 30% of tasks.

  *   **Market Fragmentation Challenge:** As major SaaS providers (Salesforce, Workday,
  ServiceNow) become agentic, the enterprise faces the complex problem of stitching
  together disparate, vendor-specific agents that speak different "languages" (frameworks
  and semantics).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Vijoy Pandey (Cisco Outshift):** The central voice, outlining the vision for
  the Internet of Agents and the role of Outshift as an internal incubator for Cisco.

  *   **Cisco:** Positioning itself as a key player, leveraging its networking expertise
  to handle the high-speed, multimodal state exchanges required by real-time agent
  collaboration.

  *   **Agency:** Mentioned as the open-source manifestation/project designed to make
  the Internet of Agents concepts concrete.

  *   **SRE Jarvis:** A concrete internal multi-agent system built by Outshift to
  automate Site Reliability Engineering tasks, accessing tools like Kubernetes, PagerDuty,
  and AWS.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a future where complex business processes are solved
  by ensembles of specialized agents, mirroring human SME teams. This requires a foundational,
  standardized platform (the IoA) to manage discovery, trust, orchestration, and evaluation
  across vendor boundaries. The pain of this transition will mirror the early days
  of cloud adoption, requiring organizations to adapt to probabilistic workflows.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Enterprise Architects, AI/ML Strategy Leaders,
  CTOs, and Product Leaders** focused on operationalizing AI, managing complex IT
  integration, and understanding the next evolution of enterprise software infrastructure
  beyond current LLM deployments.'
