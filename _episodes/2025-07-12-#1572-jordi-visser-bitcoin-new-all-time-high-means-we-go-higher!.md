    tech towards physical/infrastructure/AI-related growth, which historically correlates
    strongly with Bitcoin and Altcoin performance via rising PMIs.'
  relevance_score: 10

    winners and into more of the AI trade that is relative to construction, infrastructure,

    when PMIs around the globe start going higher.'
  topic: Investment/Strategy

    purely a liquidity play (like the Mag 7 during the pandemic) to benefiting from
    tangible global growth indicators (PMIs), signaling a durable shift.

    asset.

    trade is Bitcoin.
  topic: Investment Thesis/Adoption
- impact_reason: 'Establishes a clear causal chain: Momentum shift -> PMI bottoming
    -> Bitcoin rally. This connects stock market rotation dynamics directly to crypto
    market performance.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Historically, that momentum shift where momentum starts to break down, that's
    usually an inflection point involving the PMIs, and it's usually a bottom in the
    PMIs. And that's what feeds back into bottoms. And PMIs usually lead to a rally
    in Bitcoin.
  topic: Investment/Adoption
- impact_reason: 'Outlines an extremely bullish macroeconomic setup for Bitcoin: rising
    growth (PMIs), easing monetary policy (rate cuts), and favorable liquidity conditions,
    calling it the ''most powerful situation'' for BTC.'

  text: I can envision a scenario where the economy PMIs are going up and the Fed
    is cutting rates, and that's what I expect to happen in the second half of the

    already happened—liquidity that's already gone higher, positive stuff from the
    government, and then the Fed joining the party while the PMIs are going up.

  text: 'Core, the leading Bitcoin scaling solution, will reward you for not selling
    your Bitcoin. It''s not magic. Here''s how it works: Core is a protocol secured

    simply locking up your Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. No bridging, no lending,
    and just holding. When your validator secures Core, it earns rewards fueled by
    network activity and passes them back to you as yield.'

- impact_reason: Provides a specific, technical reason (options expiration/supply
    dynamics) for the recent Bitcoin breakout, which is valuable for traders analyzing
    market structure.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Once options expiration passed, I think a lot of the supply in Bitcoin started

    selling future production.

  topic: Technology/DeFi

    suggesting it is entering a new phase of market maturity/momentum, challenging
    the perception of it being slow-moving.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: When Bitcoin moves, it really moves. And what we've seen over the last even
    48, 72 hours is Bitcoin pretty much went from $108,000 to $118,000. I mean, that
    is not just a direction of move, but it's the severity of a move. You just don't
    see that often for a multi-trillion-dollar asset.
  topic: Investment/Market Analysis
- impact_reason: A direct prediction based on historical pattern recognition (range
    breakout leading to short squeeze), forecasting significant upside momentum for
    the current month.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: historically, when Bitcoin range trades, like you did last summer before the
    election, when it breaks out of that range, there tend to be a lot of shorts that
    have built up. And so, it just tends to go. So, I'm expecting a lot, a lot bigger
    move than what's already happened in July.
  topic: Investment/Market Analysis
- impact_reason: Connects Bitcoin's price action to broader macroeconomic indicators
    (Global M2 and dollar weakness), arguing that Bitcoin is currently undervalued
    relative to global liquidity expansion.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Global M2 has gone sharply higher. So, Bitcoin has kind of underperformed
    what would be normal. And just to give you an idea, so a lot of this is because
    of the dollar weakening. But again, the dollar weakening is good for global growth,
    it's good for assets, it's good for liquidity.
  topic: Investment/Macro
- impact_reason: Points to Bitcoin's recent decoupling from traditional risk assets
    (stocks) as evidence of its increasing strength and its ability to compel skeptical
    institutional investors to pay attention.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: the ability for Bitcoin to distance itself from stocks during the liberation
    day and actually get back to the all-time high way before the stocks did, I think
    this year has been one where Bitcoin has started to—I want to say—force anyone
    who doubts it.
  topic: Adoption/Market Analysis
- impact_reason: Illustrates the shift in institutional interest from pure Bitcoin
    focus to considering Ethereum/Alts, driven by the macroeconomic expectation that
    rising PMIs favor growth-oriented assets over pure digital gold.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I'm getting reached out. I had one yesterday on why Ethereum over Bitcoin
    right now. And it's not that I believe Ethereum is long-term a better investment
    than Bitcoin, but sometimes when you reach points where, again, if the PMI is
    going higher, historically, the Alts have done better than Bitcoin because this
    is a growth thing, this is an ec[onomic growth play].
  topic: Investment/Strategy
- impact_reason: Clearly defines the role of stablecoins as the critical bridge between
    traditional finance and crypto, and connects the AI infrastructure buildout (CoreWeave/Core
    Scientific) directly to the energy needs underpinning the digital economy.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If I think of stablecoins as the bridge between the fiat money system and
    the crypto money system, if I think about CoreWeave and Core Scientific, I think
    about this is the power side of the fiat system, which has been the AI and the
    power and energy needs of crypto.
  topic: Technology/Adoption
- impact_reason: A direct prediction on how the rise of autonomous AI agents will
    translate into tangible on-chain activity, specifically boosting stablecoin usage.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: AI agents mean higher volumes and mean higher transactions with stablecoins.
  topic: Adoption/Technology
- impact_reason: Highlights the massive, underestimated energy requirements of the
    AI buildout, using the nuclear energy executive order as evidence of the scale
    of required infrastructure investment.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The build-out for that [AI] is much bigger. Nuclear EO was signed surprisingly
    with three times the nuclear energy that we're going to need—three times the nuclear
    energy. Everyone has seen the electricity numbers in the US. The build-out of
    power and data centers is going to be a driving force.
  topic: Technology/Business
- impact_reason: Articulates the 'HODL' mentality as a structural feature of Bitcoin's
    market dynamics, suggesting that capital entering Bitcoin is sticky, unlike capital
    in other asset classes.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Bitcoin to me actually feels like it is the final home of all capital, which
    means that it is not coming back out. Like most Bitcoiners, both at the institutional
    level and the individual level, are like, 'I'm buying the Bitcoin, I'm never selling
    the Bitcoin.'
  topic: Adoption/Investment
- impact_reason: Provides a sophisticated framework for valuing Bitcoin by blending
    commodity/cyclical characteristics with high-growth innovation stock attributes,
    reinforcing the AI thesis.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Bitcoin has a little of both [cyclicality of energy, innovation of software].
    So, it has a cyclicality to it, but then it also is an innovation stock. And if
    you believe that AI is going to accelerate, I think you should be in Bitcoin.
  topic: Investment Thesis
- impact_reason: A strong prediction of continued monetary expansion ('more printing,'

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #1572 Jordi Visser | BITCOIN NEW ALL-TIME HIGH
  MEANS WE GO HIGHER!


  This 45-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast features Anthony Pompliano (Pomp) interviewing
  Jordy Visser, a 30-year Wall Street expert, to analyze the recent Bitcoin all-time
  high, its drivers, and its implications for the broader macro and equity markets,
  particularly in relation to AI infrastructure build-out.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics**, specifically
  analyzing the drivers behind the recent price breakout, the role of derivatives
  (options expiration), the growing influence of Traditional Finance (TradFi), and
  the emerging relationship between crypto, global liquidity (Global M2), and the
  structural build-out of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure**. Secondary
  focus areas include macroeconomics (tariffs, PMIs) and the rotation within the equity
  markets.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Post-Expiration Supply Reduction:** The passing of options expiration removed
  significant selling pressure and supply overhang, particularly shorts built up around
  prior all-time highs ($110k–$120k range).

  *   **Volatility Normalization:** Current 3% daily moves are considered "normal"
  for a multi-trillion-dollar asset like Bitcoin, especially with implied volatility
  remaining relatively low (under 40), suggesting these sharp moves are likely to
  continue.

  *   **Ethereum Technical Trigger:** Visser notes that Ethereum hitting and sustaining
  above $2,700 for two weeks was a technical signal that preceded its move toward
  $3,000, suggesting the start of "altcoin season."


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Sustained Momentum:** Visser is highly bullish, expecting a "very large short-covering
  squeeze" and predicting that Bitcoin could surprise to the upside significantly
  before the end of July, driven by momentum breaking out of range trading.

  *   **Liquidity Lag:** Global M2 (US, Europe, China) has increased by over $5 trillion
  this year, suggesting Bitcoin has *underperformed* relative to historical liquidity
  trends, implying significant room for further upside.

  *   **Bitcoin as the Purest AI Trade:** Visser argues that the massive infrastructure
  build-out required for AI (power, copper, data centers) is a structural growth story.
  He posits that **Bitcoin is the purest way to play this structural growth**, even
  more so than traditional tech or commodity plays.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordy Visser & Anthony Pompliano (Pomp):** The primary analysts driving the
  discussion.

  *   **Tom Lee:** Mentioned for championing the "Ethereum corporate Treasury balance
  sheet strategy," linking stablecoins and network effects.

  *   **Circle:** Its recent actions (potentially related to an IPO or regulatory
  clarity) are seen as a "ChatGPT moment" for crypto, forcing TradFi participants
  to conduct necessary research.

  *   **Core Scientific & CoreWeave:** Their partnership is highlighted as a physical
  manifestation of the link between crypto mining/power needs and the compute side
  of the AI economy.

  *   **Nvidia (Mag 7):** Used as a benchmark for high volatility and noted that the
  Mag 7 stocks have been relatively flat year-to-date, suggesting a market rotation
  is underway.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Positive Policy Impact:** Visser suggests that any positive news from Washington,
  such as progress on the **Clarity Act** or favorable stablecoin legislation (like
  the Stablecoin Act), would act as an accelerant to the current momentum.

  *   **China Trade Dynamics:** The shift in US policy towards China—moving from aggressive
  tariffs to a realization of mutual necessity (US needing rare earth minerals, China
  needing chips/software)—is creating certainty that supports higher global PMIs.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation points toward a significant **structural shift in capital allocation**:

  1.  **Rotation from Software to Infrastructure/Value:** The market is expected to
  rotate away from overvalued software/Mag 7 names toward economically sensitive sectors
  (materials, energy, commodities) that benefit from rising PMIs and the AI build-out.

  2.  **Bitcoin as the Final Home:** Bitcoin is increasingly viewed by sophisticated
  investors not just as a speculative vehicle but as a destination for capital seeking
  growth uncorrelated with traditional tech cycles, potentially acting as the "final
  home of capital."

  3.  **PMI Bottoming:** Visser predicts that global Purchasing Managers'' Index (PMI)
  data, which has been depressed for three years, is bottoming and turning up, which
  historically precedes strong rallies in Bitcoin and altcoins.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto Investors, Macro Hedge Fund Managers,
  and Institutional Analysts** who need to connect Bitcoin''s price action with broader
  macroeconomic indicators (liquidity, PMIs) and structural technology trends (AI
  infrastructure).'
