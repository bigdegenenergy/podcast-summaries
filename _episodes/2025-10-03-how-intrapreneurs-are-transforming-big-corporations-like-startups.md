summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - Intrapreneurs are innovators working inside established large organizations.
  - The goal of supporting intrapreneurs is to bring the company forward through new
    initiatives.
  - 'Successful intrapreneurship requires providing specific resources: tools, space,
    and support.'
  - This internal support gives employees the 'wings' needed to execute their innovative
    ideas.
  - The concept is historically validated, citing Steve Jobs' creation of the Macintosh
    team as an early example.
  - Intrapreneurial teams are often given dedicated, isolated spaces (like a garage)
    to foster new development.
  overview: Intrapreneurs are internal innovators within large corporations who drive
    significant organizational progress through new ideas and projects. The concept
    involves providing these individuals with the necessary tools, resources, space,
    and support to execute their visions, mirroring the agility of a startup environment.
    This approach is not new, as evidenced by historical examples like the original
    Macintosh team, which operated as an early form of intrapreneurship.
