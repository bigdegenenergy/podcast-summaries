summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Altcoin Surge in July! (My Picks to Make You
  RICH!)


  This 5-minute podcast episode focuses on identifying specific altcoin investment
  opportunities predicated on historical market timing and anticipated political developments
  favorable to the cryptocurrency industry, particularly under a potential Donald
  Trump administration.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Cryptocurrency Investment Strategy**, specifically targeting
  **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** altcoins based on perceived political alignment
  and historical market bottoms.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Historical Market Bottoms:** The speaker suggests that June has historically
  marked the bottom preceding major altcoin rallies (citing 2020 and 2021 data), implying
  that the current period (July) is an opportune buying window.

  *   **MVRV Z-Score Analysis:** The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-score
  is used as a technical indicator to argue that the bull market is *not* over. The
  score is currently far below the historical "danger zone" (above 7 or 9), which
  typically coincides with major market tops, suggesting smart money accumulation
  is still appropriate.

  *   **DeFi Sector Focus:** The investment thesis centers on the DeFi category (ranked
  #13 on CoinGecko) due to its connection with banking infrastructure, which the speaker
  anticipates will be protected by favorable political action.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Political Catalysts:** The central investment thesis is tied to Donald Trump''s
  perceived pro-crypto stance, including the consideration of an executive order to
  end banking discrimination against crypto firms.

  *   **Discounted Assets:** The speaker highlights that the selected altcoins (Chainlink,
  Ando, Aave) are significantly down (50% to 75%) from their previous cycle highs,
  presenting a high upside potential if a new bull run materializes.

  *   **Dry Powder Strategy:** The speaker advises maintaining "dry powder" to continue
  buying dips, reinforcing the belief that the current market consolidation is not
  the end of the bull cycle.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump:** Central figure whose potential policies (ending crypto banking
  discrimination) are the primary investment driver.

  *   **Sergey Nazarov (Chainlink Co-founder):** Mentioned for attending a Trump crypto
  summit, establishing a direct political link.

  *   **Ando:** Noted because the project allegedly donated to Trump''s inauguration,
  and the Trump family''s crypto entity reportedly holds a significant amount of the
  token.

  *   **Aave:** Selected because it is allegedly used as the infrastructure backbone
  for "World Liberty DeFi," a crypto company run by Trump''s sons.

  *   **Crypto Billionaires (Winklevoss twins, Brian Armstrong, CZ, Michael Saylor,
  Justin Sun):** Mentioned generally to establish the deep existing ties between major
  crypto figures and the traditional banking sector, which Trump’s policies are expected
  to support.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The key policy discussion revolves around Donald Trump potentially issuing an **Executive
  Order to end banking discrimination against crypto companies**. This is framed as
  a major positive catalyst that will protect and legitimize crypto firms, making
  DeFi projects highly attractive.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly predicts a continuation of the bull market, driven by
  political tailwinds that will legitimize and integrate the crypto sector more deeply
  into traditional finance. The immediate future suggests a strong buying opportunity
  in undervalued DeFi assets that have political connections.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This content is highly valuable for **Active Cryptocurrency Traders and Investors**
  who follow political developments closely and are looking for specific, high-conviction
  altcoin picks within the DeFi sector based on speculative political alignment.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast episode, "Altcoin Surge in July! (My Picks to Make You RICH!)," presents
  a highly speculative, yet data-backed, investment thesis centered on buying specific
  Decentralized Finance (DeFi) altcoins during the current market consolidation phase.


  The main narrative arc begins by establishing **historical timing**, asserting that
  June/July often marks the bottom before major rallies, suggesting now is the time
  to accumulate. This timing argument is immediately coupled with a **political catalyst**:
  the anticipation that Donald Trump will enact policies favorable to crypto, specifically
  an executive order to stop banking discrimination against crypto firms. The speaker
  argues that crypto billionaires already have deep ties to banking, and favorable
  regulation will directly benefit projects connected to this ecosystem.


  The core of the episode details the selection of **three specific DeFi tokens**
  that the host, DZ, has recently purchased: **Chainlink (LINK), Ando (ANDO), and
  Aave (AAVE)**. The rationale for each selection is explicitly tied to political
  connections: Chainlink’s co-founder attended a Trump crypto summit; Ando allegedly
  donated to Trump’s inauguration and is held by the Trump family’s crypto entity
  ("World Liberty DeFi"); and Aave serves as the infrastructure backbone for World
  Liberty DeFi.


  To counter the argument that the bull run is over, the host utilizes the **MVRV
  Z-score**, explaining that this metric shows market participants are far from the
  profit-taking levels seen at previous cycle tops. This technical analysis supports
  the host’s conviction that there is significant upside remaining, justifying the
  strategy of buying dips and saving dry powder.


  The episode is framed as actionable advice for investors looking to capitalize on
  political shifts within the crypto space, emphasizing that the selected tokens are
  deeply discounted (down 50-75%) from their previous peaks. The discussion concludes
  with a strong affirmation that the bull run is not finished, positioning these politically
  aligned DeFi assets as the primary vehicles for future gains. The episode also includes
  brief, unrelated advertisements for SpinQuest.com and'
