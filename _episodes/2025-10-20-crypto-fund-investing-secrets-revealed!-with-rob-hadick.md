summary: '## Crypto Fund Investing Secrets Revealed! with Rob Hadick - Comprehensive
  Summary


  This 44-minute podcast episode features Tony Edward of Thinking Crypto interviewing
  **Rob Hadick, General Partner at Dragonfly**, a cross-border crypto venture fund.
  The discussion centers on Rob’s transition from traditional finance (TradFi) at
  Goldman Sachs into full-time crypto venture capital, the evolution of institutional
  views on blockchain technology, and the future landscape of corporate adoption of
  tokenization and custom blockchain infrastructure.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Crypto Venture Investing and the Institutional Adoption of
  Blockchain Technology**. Key themes include the shift from private/permissioned
  blockchains to embracing public, open networks, the role of token incentives, and
  the emerging trend of major corporations launching their own customized Layer 2
  solutions or subnets.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Incentive Mechanisms of Tokens:** The conversation highlights that the value
  proposition of tokens is now understood to be tied to network effects, active liquidity,
  and the openness of the network, moving beyond early skepticism about their utility.

  *   **Infrastructure Readiness:** The initial vision for reinventing financial market
  infrastructure via smart contracts is finally being realized because the necessary
  infrastructure layer (scalability, speed, finality) has matured significantly since
  the early 2010s.

  *   **Hybrid Execution Environments:** Companies are increasingly opting to build
  customized execution environments (like their own L2s or subnets) that leverage
  the security and interoperability of major public chains (like Ethereum) while maintaining
  control over validator sets, sequencing, and economic sharing (e.g., MEV).


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **The "Blockchain, Not Bitcoin" Flip:** The industry has moved past the initial
  Wall Street narrative that favored private DLTs while dismissing public tokens (like
  Bitcoin). Institutions now recognize the exponential value accrual potential of
  open, permissionless networks.

  *   **Corporate Tokenization Future:** Hadick strongly believes that by 2030-2035,
  the majority of major brands will have their own L2s or specialized tokens to enhance
  brand affinity, customer engagement, and retention.

  *   **Tokenized Loyalty vs. Equity:** While tokenized equities are expected, the
  more immediate and clear application is **tokenized loyalty programs**. These tokens
  (potentially stablecoin-pegged points) offer clear balance sheet uplift for companies
  by converting deferred liabilities into actively used assets, though companies will
  likely control the interoperability between these loyalty ecosystems.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Rob Hadick (Dragonfly):** General Partner whose background spans Goldman Sachs
  (early crypto discussions, DLT exploration) and traditional asset management before
  moving fully into crypto VC.

  *   **Blythe Masters (Digital Asset Holdings/R3):** Mentioned as a key figure in
  the early "Blockchain, Not Bitcoin" movement, championing permissioned private blockchains.

  *   **Larry Fink (BlackRock):** Cited as an example of a TradFi leader who initially
  dismissed Bitcoin but has since capitulated due to market evolution.

  *   **Robinhood, Circle, Stripe:** Mentioned as examples of major players launching
  their own L2s or integrating crypto services in a way that optimizes their specific
  business needs while plugging into public chains.

  *   **VeChain:** Featured as a sponsor, noted for its enterprise adoption (Walmart
  China, BMW, UFC partnership) and its focus on being a secure, scalable L1.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  While the conversation acknowledges the importance of regulatory clarity (mentioning
  the **Clarity Act** and the **Digital Asset Markets Consumer Freedom Act**), Hadick
  suggests that many corporate decisions regarding custom L2s are currently driven
  more by **business optimization and control** (e.g., controlling sequencing, MEV,
  and validator sets) than by immediate regulatory fear. However, regulatory clarity
  is seen as a catalyst that will encourage boards to finalize their Web3 strategies.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward a highly modular and interconnected system where
  large enterprises operate their own execution environments (L2s/subnets) for specific
  business functions (like loyalty or supply chain) but rely on the security and liquidity
  of foundational public blockchains (like Ethereum) for interoperability. This signals
  a maturation where blockchain technology is treated as essential, customizable enterprise
  software.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Venture Capitalists, Fintech Professionals,
  Corporate Strategy Executives, and Institutional Investors** looking to understand
  the strategic rationale behind corporate blockchain adoption and the current investment
  thesis driving infrastructure development in the space.'
