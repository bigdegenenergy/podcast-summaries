  text: We've entered the golden age of crypto building where we finally have the
    tools and now it's about entrepreneurs coming in and saying how do we use these
    tools to make 10X impact for businesses or to build new consumer experiences that
    were previously completely impossible and the moment is now to break through because
    we've done the infrastructure work.

    3.0) as a complete, ground-up rewrite of the financial system using programmable
    software.

    start from the ground up and say, how do we make the financial system work better
    for everyone by building it on top of the programmable software platform that
    includes money and is crypto.

    with the readiness of the underlying technology, positioning it as the ideal time
    for builders to capture market share.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The thing that's powerful about that is that that's the best time for us to
    be building and the best time for YC entrepreneurs to be trying to break through
    and the moment is now to break through. Because we've done the infrastructure
    work, the tools are in place, the stablecoins, the chain, and now it's about putting
    it together into that magical experience that grows like wildfire across the world.
  topic: investment

    that prevented consumer application development, setting up the context for recent
    L2/scaling breakthroughs.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The problem that we had with the chains five years ago was you could do that,
    but it was slow and expensive. And so when you were trying to build an application
    and you wanted to maybe send a stablecoin or you wanted to enable someone to create
    something, you'd have them try and send $5 and it would cost $5.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Quantifies the impact of scaling solutions, showing the dramatic
    cost reduction necessary for mainstream consumer applications.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And the thing that has shifted over the last few years is that those costs
    have come massively down. And whether that's with base or Solana, we actually
    have this scaling that's happening where now you can build those applications
    and instead of it costing $5 to do something, it costs 5/10 of a cent or 500 of
    a cent.

    and the internet's transition from dial-up to broadband, suggesting a massive
    inflection point for crypto applications.

  text: I think this is like the classic criticism of crypto years ago was just, hey,
    like, okay, like it turns cool, but actually it's like, it's like cheaper to send
    a wire transfer than like the gas fees on like certain chains when they congested
    100%. And we think about this as the broadband moment for crypto where when we
    were in dial-up of the internet, you couldn't have the applications that exist
    today.

    and censorship resistance, which is the foundational security layer.'

  text: Layer one blockchain... they all play this role, I think, as a base layer
    of being maximally decentralized and trying to make it so that they are a global
    platform that's a piece of infrastructure that anyone can build on without being,
    you know, fearful of being censored.
  topic: technology

    using the HOV lane analogy) and how it achieves scalability without sacrificing
    L1 security/decentralization.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Layer two blockchains... build on top of it to scale while preserving decentralization
    as a core characteristic. And this is exactly what base does. So what base does
    is you can kind of think about it like an HOV lane. We sit on top of Ethereum,
    we take millions and millions of transactions, we compress them, and we publish
    them to Ethereum.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Articulates the massive, innovation-stifling overhead caused by regulatory
    uncertainty, showing how it directly contradicts the lean, customer-focused ethos
    of successful startups.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So many early stage builders and late stage builders ended up spending like
    equivalent or more money on lawyers than they were on engineers... If you have
    to spend more money on lawyers than engineers, how can you apply the YC principles
    of being customer-centric and doing things that don't scale? Literally you're
    being forced to do things that much bigger companies should be doing instead.
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: Identifies regulatory clarity and the maturation of stablecoins as
    two of the four key pillars enabling the current 'golden age' of building, alongside
    scaling and better wallets.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think the regulatory unlock is another huge part of it that's changed. I
    think stablecoins maturing is a third huge part of it that's changed, where you
    now have programmable money that's, you know, the money that we're all used to,
    that we can all use.

- impact_reason: 'This succinctly captures the fundamental shift enabled by blockchain
    technology: programmable, instantaneous global value transfer, which was previously
    impossible.'

    of pure trading, specifically in emerging markets via neo-banking applications.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The AI companies definitely get lots of attention, but we have some of these
    like Dollar App in Latam, Aspora in India. These are essentially neo-bank services
    that are really built around stablecoins, and their growth rates are incredible.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: 'Defines the core utility of stablecoins: bridging existing finance
    with programmable, global access to a stable unit of account (the dollar).'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Now, I think the thing that stablecoins unlock, which has been the primary
    thing that's driving this, is they enable programmable money to come into the
    existing financial system and give in particular programmable dollars to anyone
    in the world.
  topic: defi
- impact_reason: Emphasizes the massive financial inclusion aspect of stablecoins,
    providing access to the global reserve currency with low friction.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And so I think the first big unlock that stablecoins has done is basically
    said, okay, now everyone in the world can access dollars, and not just can they
    access it, they can build with dollars, and they can build with dollars on this
    new programmable platform, where there's dollars can move instantly, globally,
    and basically, for free.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: Identifies a critical tension in global crypto adoption—the desire
    for dollar stability versus the need to preserve local economic sovereignty—and
    points to local stablecoins as the solution.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: At the same time, when I talk to those folks, I think that there is an intuitive
    feeling of, oh man, we have our own local economy, and we don't want that economy
    to be dollarized... I think to me, that is one of the most exciting opportunities
    to lean into [building local stablecoins].

- impact_reason: 'Foreshadows the next wave of stablecoin innovation: local currency
    stablecoins that inherit the technological benefits of DeFi/crypto rails.'

  text: So you have a Brazilian Real currency, you have a Nigerian Naira currency,
    you have an Indonesian Rupiah currency, you have a stablecoin for every country,
    and what that means is that you can take all of the innovation that has kind of
    been built on top of dollar stablecoins... and apply them to your local economy.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Highlights the composability and flexibility of the underlying blockchain
    infrastructure, allowing builders to easily pivot or support multiple stablecoins
    without massive re-engineering.

  text: If you build around one stablecoin, and then another stablecoin starts growing
    really quickly... it's not going to be that hard or that expensive to say, okay,
    great, now let's support that other one too. Because again, they're all running
    in the same computer, and they're all programmable...
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: 'This is a clear investment thesis: the current infrastructure (chains,
    stablecoins, UX) is mature enough to begin the wholesale digitization and optimization
    of legacy finance via smart contracts.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Now that we have the fast chains, we have the scaled stablecoins, we have
    the mature regulatory environment, we have the easy-to-use wallets. I think the
    opportunity is basically looking at every single part of the financial system
    that exists today and figuring out how do we turn that from legacy systems that
    in many cases are 50 to 100 years old into programmable smart contracts that live
    on chain.
  topic: investment

    massive efficiency gains (1M lines of COBOL vs. 1K lines of Solidity) achievable
    by moving complex business logic on-chain.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And that smart contract ended up being about a thousand lines of code. So
    literally, like stuff that previously was a million-plus lines of code, now a
    thousand lines of code because it's a thousand lines of code running in this open
    platform computer where you have money built in, you have stablecoins built in...
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: 'Provides a nuanced view on decentralization: it''s crucial for the
    base layer (platform security/access), but not necessarily required for every
    application layer built on top (where business efficiency matters more).'

  text: From where I sit, the place where decentralization is really, really important
    is at the very bottom of the stack, right? You need decentralization at the Ethereum
    layer, at base because what that enables is it enables this global platform that
    everyone can come and participate on.

summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - The current era is defined by the availability of mature crypto tools, shifting
    the focus from infrastructure development to building magical, scalable user experiences.
  - FinTech 3.0 means rewriting financial systems from the ground up using programmable
    software platforms, contrasting with FinTech 2.0's reliance on legacy infrastructure.
  - Massive cost reductions in transaction fees, enabled by Layer 2 scaling solutions
    like BASE on top of Ethereum, have made consumer applications feasible.
  - Regulatory clarity, though still early, is a crucial unlock, reducing the need
    for startups to spend disproportionately on legal counsel and allowing them to
    focus on product development.
  - Stablecoins, particularly USD-pegged ones, have become a killer use case by providing
    programmable dollars globally, enabling instant, low-cost access to dollar-based
    finance for underserved populations.
  - A significant opportunity exists in creating local currency stablecoins to empower
    national economies without risking dollar dominance, applying existing DeFi innovations
    to local contexts.
  - Founders should look to translate existing, complex financial logic (like escrow,
    taxes, and refunds in commerce) from millions of lines of legacy code into efficient,
    few-hundred-line smart contracts.
  overview: The crypto space has entered a 'golden age of building' because the necessary
    infrastructure—matured chains, low-cost scaling via Layer 2s, and stablecoins—is
    finally in place. This moment is ideal for entrepreneurs to build transformative
    consumer and business experiences by rewriting legacy financial systems (FinTech
    3.0) rather than just improving them (FinTech 2.0). The convergence of scaling
    breakthroughs and increasing regulatory clarity is lowering barriers to entry
    and unlocking massive innovation potential.
  themes:
  - The Golden Age of Crypto Building and Infrastructure Maturity
  - The Evolution of FinTech (1.0, 2.0, and 3.0)
