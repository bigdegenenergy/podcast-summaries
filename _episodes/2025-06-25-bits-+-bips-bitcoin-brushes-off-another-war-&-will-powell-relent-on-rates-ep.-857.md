    over traditional government metrics, implying that legacy measurement systems
    are lagging or inaccurate.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I would encourage everybody here to look at trueflation.com. And Trueflation
    is an aggregator that's taking cash register data from retail. It's taking service

    are lower than the way the Fed is calibrating the number.
  topic: Technology/Data/Monetary Policy

    passing, may be intentionally structured by incumbent banking interests to stifle
    true decentralized, trustless blockchain innovation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I'm not super in love with the legislation. If you actually really read the
    legislation, it's a top-line win, but the lobbyist for the American Banking Association
    wrote a lot of that legislation. It's going to curb and make it a little bit difficult
    to get the true blockchain, trustless third-party transfers going that we would
    all like.
  topic: Regulation/Technology

    tech players (Meta, Amazon, Walmart) into the stablecoin issuance space, preserving
    the role of regulated financial entities.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: One thing that surprised me was something that prohibits any non-financial
    company from issuing stablecoins. This means Meta is going to have a hard time
    doing so. Walmart and Amazon were reportedly looking into issuing stablecoins.
    They're going to have a hard time doing so because the wording was changed at
    the last minute to prevent a tech company from becoming like a financial company...
  topic: Regulation/Adoption
- impact_reason: Identifies the prohibition on paying interest as the most critical
    regulatory hurdle, as it removes the primary competitive advantage stablecoin
    issuers could have over traditional fractional reserve banking.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Well, isn't that the big one? Yeah, that's the one for me. So that's the,
    so if they could pay interest, you're putting them in direct competition with
    the banks and you're giving the client a 100% match, non-fractional bank.
  topic: Regulation/DeFi

  text: The view from people who trade crude in size was basically there was a real,
    very real possibility of the Strait of Hormuz being shut down this time for the

    was crude oil just picked up to 72. And there is, if nothing happens, it's going
    to fall back down five to six dollars. And if they do close it, we go in straight
    back up, straight up to 100.
  topic: Investment/Market Analysis

    market participants should focus on subtle shifts in official tone rather than
    formal projections.

  text: The Fed's dot plot is generally wrong. I mean, generally they get it wrong,

    theoretically justified lower long bond yield (3.90%), providing a data-driven
    argument for immediate rate cuts.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you go to Trueflation, Trueflation is at 2.14% right now. So that would
    put the long bond, let's split the difference and say it's one and a half. Okay,
    that would put the long bond at 3.90 right now down from 4.80.
  topic: Investment/Market Trends

    from lagging indicators to forecasting—which is a major win for market transparency.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: He has gone from being data-dependent to forward-looking, which is something

  topic: Strategy/Regulation
- impact_reason: Explains the delayed and accelerating effect of tariffs on consumer
    prices, reinforcing why waiting for official CPI data might be too late to react
    to tariff impacts.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Inflation could truly spike very fast in the next two months, and we don't
    really know that because we don't know exactly what's being passed through. And
    it happens with tariffs that at the beginning, the importers are absorbing most
    of the price effect. And with the passing of time, the pass-through to the consumers
    increases dramatically.
  topic: Regulation/Adoption

    negative consequences of tariffs on complex, globalized supply chains, especially
    for high-tech manufacturing.

- impact_reason: Powerful anecdote illustrating the dramatic shift in institutional
    sentiment regarding Bitcoin, marked by the transformation of key figures like
    Larry Fink.

  text: The way BlackRock was gun-shy of Bitcoin four years ago... Then Larry Fink
    told me in the lobby at the Four Seasons Hotel in Abu Dhabi that he hated Bitcoin.
    That was November of 2021. Fast forward to January of 2024, he's launching the
    most successful, most successful Bitcoin ETF.
  topic: Adoption/Investment
- impact_reason: A bearish outlook on Circle's long-term competitive position, predicting
    that regulatory clarity will invite significant competition, compressing margins.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Circle's monopoly can only get weakened from here, certainly not going to
    get stronger.
  topic: Business/Investment
- impact_reason: 'Explains the mechanics behind the high valuation and volatility:
    low float and lock-up periods create artificial scarcity, overriding fundamental
    valuation.'

  text: So Circle has ultra-tight free float. This is about 15% of the shares, and
    it's very little is going to hit the market. I mean, there's really nothing hidden

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Bits + Bips: Bitcoin Brushes Off Another War & Will
  Powell Relent on Rates? - Ep. 857


  This episode of Bits + Bips, recorded live before the announcement of the Israel-Iran
  ceasefire, dives deep into the intersection of escalating geopolitical tensions,
  their immediate impact on financial markets (especially oil and Bitcoin), and the
  ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve''s interest rate path. The discussion
  features host James Safer alongside Alex Kruger, Noel Atterson, and special guest
  Anthony Scaramucci.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus areas were:

  1. **Geopolitical Risk & Markets:** Analyzing the immediate and potential longer-term
  financial fallout from the recent escalation between Israel and Iran, particularly
  concerning oil prices and Bitcoin''s role as a macro asset.

  2. **Federal Reserve Policy:** Debating the market''s expectation for Fed rate cuts
  versus the Fed''s current "dot plot" projections, and interpreting recent shifts
  in Fed officials'' rhetoric.

  3. **US Stablecoin/ETF Regulation:** A planned, though briefly touched upon, discussion
  regarding the timeline and specifics of potential US stablecoin and Bitcoin ETF
  approvals.

  4. **Domestic Politics:** A significant tangent on New York City politics, specifically
  the potential impact of Eric Adams'' policies versus a hypothetical shift toward
  more socialist-leaning governance.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  * **Market Pricing of Geopolitical Risk:** The market''s reaction to the Iran-Israel
  conflict was characterized as a near-perfect replay of a previous 2024 event, where
  initial panic gave way to relief after a highly telegraphed, low-damage counterattack
  by Iran. This suggests markets are pricing in a probabilistic, rather than binary,
  escalation scenario.

  * **Oil Market Sensitivity to Strait of Hormuz:** Trading houses viewed the potential
  closure of the Strait of Hormuz as the critical kinetic event that would send crude
  oil prices straight to \$100, fundamentally changing the inflation and geopolitical
  landscape.

  * **Trueflation Data:** The discussion highlighted the use of real-time data aggregators
  like Trueflation (using cash register and service data) as a potentially more accurate
  measure of current inflation than official government statistics, suggesting inflation
  may be stickier than the Fed anticipates.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  * **Bitcoin as a Macro Hedge:** Bitcoin demonstrated its function as a global macro
  asset, trading actively while other traditional markets were closed during the peak
  uncertainty of the weekend attacks.

  * **Oil Price Volatility:** Oil spiked significantly in anticipation of worst-case
  scenarios (Strait closure) but rapidly retreated upon confirmation of de-escalation,
  illustrating how quickly risk premiums are priced and repriced.

  * **Fed Rate Cut Discrepancy:** Markets are pricing in significantly more rate cuts
  (around 50bps this year, more next year) than the Fed''s current dot plot suggests
  (closer to 25bps or less this year), creating a divergence that traders are betting
  against the Fed on.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  * **Anthony Scaramucci (Baron of Skybridge House):** Provided geopolitical context,
  suggesting the US strikes were partly intended to help Netanyahu domestically and
  that the overall de-escalation messaging from the US was positive. He also offered
  strong opinions on NYC politics.

  * **Alex Kruger (Kruger Macro):** Analyzed the conflict''s structure as a "perfect
  replay" of past events, leading to market relief.

  * **Ira Jersey (Bloomberg Fed Rate Strategist):** Mentioned as being in the camp
  predicting two cuts (50bps) this year, contrasting with the Fed''s median projection.

  * **Bitwise/Matt Hogan:** Mentioned via sponsorship for their CIO Memo summarizing
  crypto market movements.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  * **US Surveillance and Crypto:** Scaramucci argued that concerns about secure communication
  (Signal, WhatsApp) are largely moot in the context of US surveillance capabilities,
  implying that if the government is tracking terror cells, they have access to most
  private digital communications.

  * **NYC Governance:** A strong critique was leveled against the policies of Mayor
  Adams and figures like AOC, arguing that while well-intended, they exacerbate economic
  desperation by failing to foster equal opportunity, leading to business flight and
  declining city services.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that while the immediate kinetic threat in the Middle
  East appears to have subsided, the underlying geopolitical shifts (like the non-attendance
  of key Asian allies at the NATO summit) signal long-term structural changes that
  markets are currently complacent about. Regarding the Fed, the increasing dovishness
  among some officials suggests a potential pivot is coming, possibly driven by real-time
  inflation data suggesting the current policy stance is too restrictive.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto and Macro Investment Professionals**
  (traders, analysts, portfolio managers) who need to synthesize geopolitical events
  with monetary policy expectations to inform their asset allocation decisions.'
