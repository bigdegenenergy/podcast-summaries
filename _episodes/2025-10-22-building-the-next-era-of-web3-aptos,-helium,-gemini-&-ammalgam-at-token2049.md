summary: '## Podcast Summary: Building the Next Era of Web3: Aptos, Helium, Gemini
  & Ammalgam at Token2049


  This 65-minute episode of "The Edge of Show," recorded live at Token2049 in Singapore,
  featured deep dives into the infrastructure and application layers of Web3, focusing
  heavily on the technological advancements of **Aptos** and the decentralized physical
  infrastructure (DePIN) evolution of **Helium**.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centered on **Blockchain Infrastructure, Scalability, Institutional
  Adoption, Programmable Money (Stablecoins), AI integration in DeFi, and Decentralized
  Physical Networks (DePIN)**. The narrative arc moved from the foundational technology
  of Aptos (derived from Meta''s Diem project) to the real-world utility of Helium''s
  decentralized wireless networks, all framed within the context of driving mass consumer
  adoption.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Aptos and Move Language:** Aptos leverages technology developed from Meta’s
  Diem project, specifically the **Move language**, which is designed as a safer,
  more intuitive way to program smart contracts, focusing on asset safety and resource
  management.

  *   **Dual-Purpose DeFi Pools:** A novel concept introduced involves asset pools
  designed for dual functionality—serving purposes similar to both Uniswap (liquidity
  provision) and Aave (lending/borrowing), maximizing capital efficiency.

  *   **Helium''s Infrastructure Shift:** Helium successfully scaled its initial IoT
  network (reaching 1 million hotspots) but faced significant L1 blockchain scaling
  challenges running the chain on low-compute hotspots. This led to the migration
  of the core blockchain functionality to a more robust L1 architecture, allowing
  the network to focus on scaling physical infrastructure deployment (IoT and Mobile).


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Institutional Confidence in Aptos:** Major financial institutions like BlackRock
  and Franklin Templeton are showing confidence in Aptos due to its focus on **high-assurance
  security** and the proven background of its team from high-stakes environments like
  Meta.

  *   **Stablecoin Utility as Mass Adoption Driver:** The rapid onboarding of major
  stablecoins (USDT, USDC, PYUSD, etc.) onto Aptos signals that programmable money
  and stablecoin utility are currently the most viable paths toward mass consumer
  adoption, proving out the business model.

  *   **Cloud Infrastructure Disruption:** A significant untapped market identified
  is the **$300 billion cloud infrastructure industry**, which Aptos is targeting
  for disruption via decentralized compute and storage systems (e.g., the "Shelby"
  project with Jump Crypto) to support next-gen AI models.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Aptos Labs:** Represented by the CEO and Co-founder (interviewed), detailing
  the journey from Diem/Move development to the current L1.

  *   **Helium/Nova Labs:** Represented by Frank Mongles (COO), discussing the evolution
  from IoT coverage to the consumer-facing **Helium Mobile** 5G/wireless network.

  *   **Financial Giants:** BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, and Apollo were cited as
  institutions actively building or exploring infrastructure on Aptos.

  *   **AI Agents in DeFi:** The conversation heavily featured the potential for **AI
  agents** to manage personalized investment portfolios on-chain, dynamically rebalancing
  based on user risk parameters and asset availability.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  While not a central focus, the discussion implicitly touches on regulatory comfort
  through **institutional adoption**. The confidence shown by firms like BlackRock
  suggests that the infrastructure being built (especially around tokenization and
  stablecoins) is meeting the necessary security and compliance thresholds required
  for traditional finance integration.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward:

  1.  **Hyper-Efficient Programmable Money:** Where users seamlessly transact across
  different stablecoins without manual swapping, driven by low transaction costs (Aptos
  boasts fractions of a cent).

  2.  **AI-Driven Finance:** The evolution of DeFi from speculative spot markets to
  sophisticated, automated investment platforms managed by AI agents tailored to individual
  risk profiles.

  3.  **DePIN Utility Expansion:** Decentralized networks are moving beyond niche
  crypto applications (like IoT tracking) into essential consumer services, exemplified
  by Helium Mobile offering free phone plans by leveraging network contributions.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Web3 Infrastructure Developers, Blockchain
  Investors (VCs and Institutional), DeFi Strategists, and Enterprise Technology Leaders**
  interested in the convergence of blockchain, AI, and real-world asset tokenization.'
