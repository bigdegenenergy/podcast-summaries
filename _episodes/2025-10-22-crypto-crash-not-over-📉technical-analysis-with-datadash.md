    spot ETF that is live. So we've got that going on. You also look at in general,
    their ETF now is paying a six to 7% yield to holder. So this changes the dream,

  text: Personally, it's a pass on to me just because I don't love if again, if I'm
    deploying brand new capital today, I don't love to chase something that's basically
    breaking out into new all-time highs.
  topic: Investment/Strategy
- impact_reason: Provides a counter-argument to the previous point, acknowledging
    that chasing breakouts is often necessary to capture momentum-driven moves in
    strong assets like BTC or Gold.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The only thing about that is a lot of times that is what gains the momentum,
    though, right? You know, you could argue the same thing against gold and Bitcoin
    recently where if you didn't buy it at the breakout, just because it was the highest
    thing on the market that day, you're still lost out on that move.

    a bullish outlook for Bitcoin into 2026, suggesting a divergence in future performance.

    And then Bitcoin, I think is going to make that next move up in 26 as well.

    ultimate $5000) based on impulse extension analysis.

    mean, that's a, that's a no-brainer at this point. But the way I look at this
    too is I would just take a simple extension right here from that last impulse
    move and take it to our high. Let's assume we get a bounce off of this 382, around
    4,000 dollars. And then the next two that I could see... push up to 46 and then
    ultimately 5,000 I think is a really big number for gold in the future there.

  text: 196 was a crucial level to hold above. And we were discussing how the spot
    ETF and some of the volume that was coming into Solana really added to the idea
    here that we would see that next jaunt up. Because as long as we were holding
    above 196, I imagined that we would push up probability-wise to 274 and 323.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Crypto Crash Not Over? 📉 Technical Analysis with DataDash


  This 38-minute episode focused heavily on the current macroeconomic headwinds impacting
  the crypto market, juxtaposed with technical analysis of Bitcoin, and significant
  regulatory developments affecting stablecoins. The discussion featured host commentary
  and detailed technical breakdowns from guest Paul (DataDash).


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus was the **intersection of macroeconomic instability (US government
  shutdown, potential interest rate impacts) and the technical positioning of Bitcoin
  (BTC)**. A major secondary focus was the **regulatory landscape surrounding stablecoins
  and digital asset custody**, specifically concerning proposed "skinny master accounts"
  and the implications for yield-bearing stablecoin products.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin''s Current Range and Bearish Setup:** The analyst suggested that Bitcoin
  likely put in a short-term top at $126k and is currently in a cooling-off or range-bound
  phase. A specific harmonic pattern (Gartley) suggested a potential short-term push
  toward $120k, but the overall near-term expectation is a move down toward the **$94k–$97k
  support zone** before any potential continuation to new all-time highs in 2026.

  *   **Gold/Bitcoin Rotation:** A significant, rare (sigma-level) 6% one-day drop
  in gold prices coincided with a brief spike in Bitcoin, suggesting a momentary rotation
  of liquidity, though BTC quickly gave back those gains. The technical analysis suggests
  gold is due for a healthy pullback to the 38.2% retracement level (around $4,000)
  before potentially targeting $4,400 and $5,000 long-term.

  *   **Solana (SOL) Technicals:** Despite positive news (Hong Kong ETF approval,
  6-7% yield), SOL lost a crucial technical support level at **$196**. The immediate
  buy zone suggested was around $150, with the long-term expectation remaining a push
  toward $274 and $323 by year-end.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Macro Over Crypto Sentiment:** The immediate market pressure on BTC is being
  driven more by the **US government shutdown and rising unemployment claims** than
  by typical crypto catalysts (like ETF news).

  *   **Fear & Greed Disconnect:** Despite BTC trading near $108k–$109k, market sentiment
  metrics remain in **"Extreme Fear,"** which historically suggests the market is
  not yet topping out.

  *   **Divergent Expert Views:** The episode contrasted the extremely bullish S&P
  500 call by **Tom Lee ($7,000 target)** with the more cautious, range-bound view
  from **Mike Novogratz**, who sees BTC needing to break $125k to accelerate further.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Fed Governor Waller:** His comments strongly suggested that the Federal Reserve
  views payment accounts (even those holding stablecoins) as transactional, not investment
  vehicles, and is resistant to allowing them to bear yield, which could complicate
  stablecoin regulation.

  *   **Brian Armstrong (Coinbase):** Mentioned as being in D.C. lobbying for clarity
  alongside other figures regarding pending legislation like the Clarity Act.

  *   **Mike Novogratz (Galaxy Digital):** Provided a more measured outlook, suggesting
  BTC is likely range-bound between $100k and $125k unless major external catalysts
  (like premature Fed action or bill passage) occur.

  *   **Tom Lee (Fundstrat):** Highlighted for his highly aggressive, contrarian bullish
  stance on both the S&P 500 and crypto.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The core regulatory discussion centered on **"skinny master accounts"** being debated
  in relation to the **Genius Act**. The concern is that if stablecoin issuers cannot
  legally offer yield on reserves (as suggested by Waller), it could significantly
  hinder the adoption and utility of stablecoins, potentially forcing them into the
  DeFi space or limiting their appeal compared to traditional bank deposits.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is heading toward a period of **consolidation
  and regulatory uncertainty**. While long-term bullish projections for BTC (to $200k+
  by 2026) remain, the short-to-medium term is expected to be choppy, range-bound,
  and heavily influenced by traditional macro factors (interest rates, government
  stability). Positive developments for Ethereum (Shopify, Stripe, ETF news) are noted,
  but technical analysis suggests price action often lags major news events.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Investors and Traders (Intermediate to Advanced)** who rely on technical
  analysis (Fibonacci retracements, harmonic patterns) and need to understand how
  macroeconomic events and evolving US regulatory frameworks (especially regarding
  stablecoins) are shaping near-term market direction.'
