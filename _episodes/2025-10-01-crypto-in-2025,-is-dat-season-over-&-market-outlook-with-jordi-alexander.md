    going to try to force projects to have a higher float and avoid this. I think
    people have forgotten all about that, and now we're in like low-float, low-float
    season part two.
  topic: regulation/tokenomics

    people are going to have to learn their lesson just through going through these
    downturns once eventually tokens unlock.

summary: '## Comprehensive Summary of "Crypto In 2025, Is DAT Season Over & Market
  Outlook With Jordi Alexander"


  This podcast episode, featuring Felix from Ford Guidance interviewing Jordi Alexander,
  founder of Selini Capital, provides a candid assessment of the current crypto market
  structure, recent volatility, and emerging narratives, recorded at the Origin Summit
  in Seoul.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centered on the **current state of the crypto markets**, focusing
  heavily on **Perpetual DEXs (Perp DEXs)**, the **diminishing relevance of the four-year
  halving cycle**, the **decline of the DAO narrative**, and the potential resurgence
  of **AI in Web3**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Perp DEX Mechanics:** The conversation highlighted the complex balancing act
  required by new Perp DEXs (like Hyperliquid, Lighter, and Aster) between attracting
  users via large airdrops (emissions) and maintaining token price stability, noting
  that excessive airdrops can lead to significant selling pressure.

  *   **Low-Float Token Structures:** The speakers observed a resurgence of low-float,
  high Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) token structures, despite past complaints and
  promises from exchanges like Binance to curb this practice. This structure favors
  short-term price spikes but leads to poor long-term token performance upon unlocks.

  *   **Web2/Web3 Integration:** A key technical/product focus is on applications
  that successfully bridge Web2 functionality with Web3 rails (e.g., tokenized video
  generation via Everland), suggesting these "breaching" apps could be the next major
  growth vectors.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Market Cycle Skepticism:** Jordi Alexander explicitly stated he does not believe
  in the traditional four-year halving cycle anymore, attributing this to the current
  macro environment where the Fed can easily manage dips due to high national debt,
  making a true bear market unlikely.

  *   **Current Market Phase:** The market is characterized by confusing dispersion:
  strong macro indicators (gold soaring, equities up) are not translating to broad
  Bitcoin strength. Liquidity is currently concentrated in short-lived, rotating narratives
  (like the Perp DEX war). The recent liquidation cascade suggests a necessary "flush
  out" or reset is underway, but the expectation is a resumption upward rather than
  a bear market.

  *   **DAO Narrative Over:** The DAO season is largely considered "over" due to low
  retail appetite for non-BTC native tokens, compressing margins for market makers,
  and the realization that many DAOs are stuck with unsellable treasury assets, reducing
  the perceived value of holding their tokens.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordi Alexander (Selini Capital):** The expert guest providing market analysis
  and investment perspectives.

  *   **Hyperliquid:** Highlighted as the dominant winner in the Perp DEX space so
  far, setting the benchmark for the current narrative.

  *   **Lighter:** Mentioned as a strong competitor in the Perp DEX war, noted for
  its zero-fee structure and focus on retail user flow (Jordi is an angel investor).

  *   **Story Protocol & Pudgy Penguins:** Mentioned as examples of projects successfully
  bridging Web3 concepts (programmable IP, digital collectibles) into broader ecosystems.

  *   **Guy at Athena:** Referenced for admitting mistakes in early tokenomics structure,
  underscoring the difficulty in designing sustainable token models.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  While no specific regulatory actions were detailed, the discussion implicitly touched
  on policy by noting that **governments are increasingly engaging with crypto infrastructure**
  (e.g., mining and DeFi), suggesting that a complete regulatory crackdown or sustained
  bear market is less likely given this institutional adoption.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is moving toward:

  1.  **Consolidation in Derivatives:** The Perp DEX war will likely see consolidation,
  but the category remains large enough for secondary players to capture significant
  volume.

  2.  **AI Resurgence:** An AI-themed season is anticipated, potentially in Q4 or
  Q1, driven by killer applications that effectively use crypto rails.

  3.  **Operational Evolution of DAOs:** Successful DAOs will need to evolve into
  cash-flow-generating operating companies or "public discretionary hedge funds" rather
  than just treasury management entities to maintain relevance.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto/DeFi Professionals, Hedge Fund Managers, and Sophisticated Retail Investors**
  who need high-level, nuanced views on market structure, emerging narratives (Perp
  DEXs, AI), and the strategic implications of token design (tokenomics, float).'
