    focused ecosystems (like Elixir/Hex) as a security advantage against larger, more
    targeted ecosystems (like NPM).

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So there is this kind of obvious truth that if you're using Elixir and Hex,
    the probability of being hacked by this package dependency problem is genuinely
    lower compared to NPM. You're pulling in less software. It's from a smaller group
    of trusted people.

  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Programmers are turning away from all these public expressions of interest
    rather than flip through a book or search a website like Stack Exchange for answers

  text: I just think of anything where people are using agents and wanting to interact
    with the web page because things like OpenAI and Anthropic, they have a web service,
    a web tool that you could use. But that's actually kind of expensive in terms
    of how many tokens it uses and the cost of doing a web search versus, hey, I'm
    already running this on my own hardware. I have my own network. I can make this

    and contrasts the current crisis in NPM with the relative security posture of
    the Elixir/Hex ecosystem.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: At the same time, right now, everyone's watching NPM be this dumpster fire
    from a security point of view. There was this security worm, which of course could
    happen in Elixir. The Hex team is fantastic, but this is a problem inherent to
    all package managers.
  topic: security/supply chain

    choices (using Elixir instead of Java) provided effective, albeit technically

    we're going to get happy to be tracked down all the servers in that environment.
    We didn't have any Java running exposed to the public internet and we're safe.
    And yeah, you can say, oh, well, technically, that's not, you know, you're doing
    security through obscurity by using Elixir, but it worked.

    reduced boilerplate and direct coercion/parsing capabilities, suggesting a more
    efficient workflow for handling web input.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So you don't have to, you know, do the embedded schema, for example, go through
    changesets and then do the apply action. Like you don't do that, like you would
    with Ecto. And said, with Zoe, you define your types, your shape, whatever it
    needs to be. And then you throw in the params right into it and it can do things
    for you as well to coerce into that shape, to parse, you know, into datetimes,
    for example.

    if this is true, if this condition is true, and that's where the code comes in,
    right? Like if this condition is true, it goes over here. And if this condition
    is false, so does this. It's just really neat, you know, because now you have
    like this nice security diagram of this is how our security access policy is implemented
    with logic that's pulled, you know, you could just regenerate it from the current
    snapshot of your application.

    work done by stewards significantly lowers the barrier to entry for businesses
    wanting to adopt specific technologies in regulated markets (like the EU).'

    disk storage overhead, offering flexibility for derived data (like extracting
    timestamps from UUIDv7s or JSONB fields).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Another one, virtual columns. This is pretty nice. Virtual columns can now
    be computed at query time. Yay. So Postgres had a limitation... you can now generate
    that column and not let it be materialized in the database, materialized in the
    sense that it's actually storing it on the disk. So it will now compute that at
    time of query.

    it does is it explores that web page, executes JS, interacts with it, and converts
    it all to markdown so that it can be used for an LLM.

  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Postgres 18 can now do index skip scans. What does that mean? That means your

    you couldn't use that index... And so now Postgres 18 will now automatically use
    that efficient index, even if it is multi-column, but then skip the part that

summary: '## Podcast Summary: 273: Does the Language Really Matter?


  This episode of Thinking Elixir focuses heavily on recent developments within the
  Elixir/BEAM ecosystem, particularly around tooling, security posture, and database
  advancements, while also touching upon broader AI industry trends. The central theme,
  as suggested by the title, seems to be less about the language itself and more about
  the robust, evolving tooling and community efforts that make the language viable
  and secure for professional use.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus areas are **Elixir/BEAM Ecosystem Tooling and Security**, **Database
  Technology (PostgreSQL)**, and **Generative AI/LLM Tooling**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Web Interaction Tooling for LLM Agents:** Chris McCord released a public Go-lang
  tool that converts web page content (including JS execution and interaction) into
  Markdown for LLM consumption, offering a potentially cheaper, self-hosted alternative
  to expensive proprietary web search APIs from OpenAI/Anthropic.

  *   **PostgreSQL 18 Performance & Flexibility:** Major updates include **index skip
  scans** for multi-column indexes (improving query efficiency when only a subset
  of indexed columns is needed) and the introduction of **virtual columns** computed
  at query time, allowing for dynamic data extraction (e.g., from JSONB or UUIDs)
  without materializing storage.

  *   **Zoe Schema Validation:** A new Elixir library, inspired by TypeScript''s Zod,
  offers a simple, flexible, and less tedious way to define and validate/coerce incoming
  data (like web input) compared to relying solely on Ecto Changesets.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Security as a Competitive Advantage:** The discussion highlights that the
  BEAM ecosystem''s smaller attack surface (compared to NPM/JavaScript) and proactive
  security planning (Aegis Initiative) provide a genuine, albeit often overlooked,
  security benefit that can influence enterprise adoption, especially given upcoming
  regulations like the EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA).

  *   **Tooling Maturity:** The immediate usability of new tools like Zoe and Ash
  Diagrams suggests the Elixir ecosystem is rapidly filling necessary gaps, making
  it more attractive for production systems that require strong data validation and
  clear architectural visualization.

  *   **LLM Cost Optimization:** The open-sourcing of web scraping/parsing tools for
  agents points to a market trend where developers seek to reduce reliance on expensive,
  token-heavy proprietary LLM tools for basic web interaction tasks.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Chris McCord:** Released the public web-scraping CLI tool derived from his
  `fly.io` agent work.

  *   **Michael Lubis (Paraxial.io):** Discussed the nuances of "security through
  obscurity."

  *   **Jonathan Manchin:** Creator of **Ash Diagrams**, noted for his active role
  in the EEF security working group.

  *   **Anthropic:** Released **Claude 3.5** and **Claude Code 2.0**, continuing the
  rapid pace of LLM competition.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA):** This legislation is driving significant security
  improvements within the BEAM ecosystem. The Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (EEF) is
  actively preparing by implementing the **Aegis Initiative** to meet requirements
  for open-source software stewards.

  *   **EEF Aegis Initiative:** This plan includes webhooks for publishers, trusted
  publishing via SLSA provenance, registry scanning, and transparency logs, aiming
  to secure the software supply chain and make Elixir/OTP compliant for EU deployment.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward **highly secure, verifiable software supply chains**,
  driven by legislation like the CRA. For Elixir, this means formalizing vulnerability
  reporting (CNA/CVE integration) and ensuring critical libraries are financially
  supported. In AI, the rapid iteration cycle suggests that specialized models (like
  Claude''s coding capabilities) will continue to trade leadership positions, emphasizing
  the need for developers to benchmark tools against specific language needs (Elixir
  scored well in recent LLM coding benchmarks).


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Elixir/BEAM developers, architects, and engineering
  leaders** concerned with application security, database performance optimization,
  and staying current with ecosystem tooling maturity. It is also relevant for **AI/ML
  practitioners** integrating LLMs into development workflows.'
