    the chart in Hood, we look at the weekly chart, is not in Hood, in Coinbase, is
    a very, very, very big inverse head and shoulders. And this chart pattern is a
    monster. You know, something, something around here, we break, we break that previous

    There was that spike, but generally it was like this inverse head and shoulders,

    need to go a bit lower first.

  topic: market analysis
- impact_reason: Outlines a specific macro scenario (sideways/strong dollar correction)
    that leads to lower interest rates and a final, highly speculative market frenzy—a
    classic setup for major asset price spikes.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If it continues to trend sideways or a little bit stronger [the dollar], that
    would be a corrective phase when everyone starts thinking it's all over, we'll
    give up now. Then we should get Phase 3, which is the final leg in the dollar,
    potentially a leg lower in rates, and the more speculative frenzy that comes at
    the last part of this.
  topic: strategy/market analysis
- impact_reason: This is a strong bullish sentiment disguised as short-term caution.
    The speaker explicitly states they are unconcerned about crypto fundamentals despite
    current sideways movement ('chopping around'), anticipating a 'next leg' up after
    digestion.

    Bitcoin) but immediately contextualizes it against macro factors (draining liquidity,
    peaking economic surprises), suggesting caution despite the signal.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I do see a 13 daily on Bitcoin. The only problem I have with this is if we
    look here, you know, kind of December time, liquidity was draining, and city economic
    surprises had peaked.
  topic: investment/technology
- impact_reason: Contrasts current overbought conditions with previous cycles, noting
    that current market structure (implied rising liquidity) suggests continuation
    rather than immediate reversal, which is crucial for risk assessment.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Yes, equities are also overbought. But again, the last two times we triggered
    overbought readings, this was the boring zone... In both of these situations,
    liquidity was draining. And here, here's an RSI overbought reading in the market,
    just went higher. It feels much more like this than either of these two events.
  topic: investment/market analysis
- impact_reason: Downplays the significance of recent bond market volatility on the
    long-term weekly chart, suggesting that the market's fear regarding yields is
    currently overblown relative to the macro structure.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The other one is 10-year yields. 10-year yields on the weekly have gone nowhere.
    So everyone's all the fretting and screaming and shouting to make yields and the
    world's going to wear. Nothing has happened.
  topic: regulation/market analysis
- impact_reason: Compares the current 10-year yield situation to 2017, suggesting
    a period of range-bound trading for yields, which is generally favorable for risk
    assets like crypto and equities.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: When I look at the daily, we've got a chance that yields are going to, we've
    got this 13 and this 9. But we haven't seen there, whether we come back down,
    it just doesn't, it feels like more like 2017 where yields actually don't go anywhere.
  topic: market analysis/strategy
- impact_reason: Confirms a critical technical retest on the Bitcoin Dominance chart,
    suggesting a potential inflection point for capital rotation out of BTC and into
    altcoins.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think that there's no, no, we kind of had a trend line here. Well, if that
    was, if that's right, we just, yeah, we just retested and and and we're slower.
    That's right. So that's that's one that's interesting to me. [Referring to Bitcoin
    Dominance chart]
  topic: technology/investment
- impact_reason: This draws a historical parallel (2017) for current market digestion,
    suggesting that massive prior moves are followed by consolidation before the next
    major trend. While applied to yields/dollar index here, it's a key strategic insight
    for asset management.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: if we go back to that chart you were saying of 2017, it's kind of suggesting
    that these corrected patterns eventually fall away. The market digests the huge
    move that we had. It's a monstrous move. And then we go to another leg lower where
    we think it probably goes to somewhere between 95 and 90.

summary: '## Real Vision Alpha SNEAK PEEK: Shooting the Sh!t with Raoul Pal & Julien
  Bittel - Comprehensive Summary


  This 36-minute episode is a "sneak peek" into the premium, informal "Raoul and Julian
  Shooting the Sh!t" segment of Real Vision, offering listeners a behind-the-scenes
  look at Raoul Pal and Julian Bittel''s market analysis process, focusing heavily
  on macro indicators, crypto technicals, and their current investment theses.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the intersection of **Macroeconomics (especially inflation
  and growth momentum)**, **Financial Conditions**, and **Cryptocurrency Market Technical
  Analysis**. A significant portion is dedicated to validating their prior expectations
  regarding the ISM (Purchasing Managers'' Index) rebound and analyzing the implications
  for global liquidity (M2) and the US Dollar.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **ISM Rebound Confirmation:** Their long-held thesis that the expected recession/ISM
  collapse was incorrect is being validated by recent regional PMI data showing significantly
  stronger growth momentum than consensus expected. This forces a "reprice" of growth
  expectations.

  *   **Financial Conditions vs. M2:** Financial conditions (a composite of yields,
  dollar, commodities) are shown to lead Global M2. The recent easing in financial
  conditions suggests a potential bottoming/reversal in M2, which is crucial for predicting
  the next major market phase.

  *   **Bitcoin/Altcoin Setups:** Several major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Solana,
  Coinbase, Ethereum) are exhibiting classic bullish continuation patterns, primarily
  **Inverse Head and Shoulders formations**, suggesting potential for significant
  upside once current corrective chop resolves.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Timing the Correction:** The expected corrective phase in markets (potentially
  August/September) is heavily tied to the US Dollar''s next move. If the Dollar moves
  higher toward 104 (as DeMark counts suggest), it would unlock this corrective period.

  *   **Anticipating Phase 3:** Pal suggests that after the current sideways/minor
  correction (Phase 2), the market is setting up for **Phase 3: the final speculative
  frenzy**, characterized by a final leg lower in the Dollar, potentially lower rates,
  and a speculative climax.

  *   **Crypto Strength Indicators:** Low Solana levels (below 50) are highlighted
  as historical precursors to massive rallies (10x moves), suggesting current weakness
  might be an accumulation opportunity. Bitcoin dominance falling below 61.5% is flagged
  as the true start of a major altseason.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Raoul Pal & Julian Bittel:** The hosts, providing their proprietary analytical
  frameworks (GMI financial conditions model, DeMark counts, wave counting).

  *   **Bitwise Investments:** Heavily promoted as the "best crypto asset manager,"
  highlighting their ETF offerings, private alpha strategies, and institutional Ethereum
  staking services.

  *   **FIGA & Ledn:** Sponsors offering crypto-backed lending solutions, emphasizing
  the ability to access liquidity without selling Bitcoin.

  *   **Tesla, Coinbase (COIN), Rocket Lab (RKLB):** Mentioned as high-conviction
  stock/asset trades showing strong technical setups (especially inverse H&S patterns).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  There was **no substantive discussion** on specific regulatory frameworks or policy
  changes within this segment, as the focus remained strictly on market structure
  and technical analysis.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly implies that the current market environment is transitioning
  from a period of uncertainty (the "boring zone") into a more defined, potentially
  explosive growth phase, particularly within crypto (altseason). The key is correctly
  timing the Dollar''s peak to position for the final speculative leg (Phase 3) before
  2030''s "economic singularity."


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **experienced crypto traders, macro investors,
  and existing Real Vision subscribers** who are familiar with Pal''s proprietary
  terminology (GMI, DeMark counts, Phase 1/2/3 cycles) and are looking for actionable,
  high-conviction trade ideas derived from top-down analysis.

  ### Comprehensive Narrative Summary


  The podcast opens with Raoul Pal framing this segment as a privileged look behind
  the Real Vision paywall, showcasing the casual yet alpha-rich discussions he has
  with Julian Bittel.


  The core of the discussion immediately dives into **macro validation**. Pal confirms
  that recent economic data (PMIs) is beating expectations, validating their prior
  contrarian view that a deep recession was unlikely. This stronger growth momentum
  requires them to **reprice** their models, shifting focus from recession fears to
  managing stronger growth expectations.


  A critical technical link is established between **Financial Conditions** (Pal''s
  proprietary index) and **Global M2**. They observe that financial conditions are
  leading M2 lower, suggesting a corrective phase is imminent, likely centered around
  August/September, heavily dependent on the US Dollar''s trajectory. Pal presents
  DeMark wave counts suggesting the Dollar could rally to 104, which would trigger
  this correction. However, he maintains that the medium-term trend for the Dollar
  is lower, setting the stage for **Phase 3**—the final, most speculative leg of the
  cycle.


  The conversation pivots sharply to **crypto technicals**. Despite minor recent chop,
  the underlying charts for Bitcoin, Solana, and Coinbase are overwhelmingly bullish,
  displaying textbook Inverse Head and Shoulders patterns. Solana''s low levels are
  specifically flagged as a historical signal for massive upside. They contrast the
  current environment (rising liquidity, strong growth repricing) with previous overbought
  readings where liquidity was draining, concluding that the current market structure
  supports further upside rather than an immediate reversal.'
