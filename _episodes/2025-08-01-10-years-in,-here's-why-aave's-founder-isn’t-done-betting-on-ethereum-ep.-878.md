summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: 10 Years In, Here''s Why Aave''s Founder Isn’t
  Done Betting on Ethereum - Ep. 878


  This 75-minute episode features an in-depth conversation between host Laura Shin
  and Stani Kulechov, founder of the DeFi lending giant Aave, reflecting on the 10th
  anniversary of the Ethereum network and the future trajectory of decentralized finance.
  Kulechov expresses **unwavering bullishness on Ethereum (ETH)**, viewing it as the
  superior foundation for building resilient, large-scale financial infrastructure,
  even amidst recent market skepticism and the rise of competing Layer 1s (Alt-L1s).


  The discussion charts Ethereum’s evolution from its early days (pre-DeFi) to its
  current state, highlighting its remarkable resilience (zero downtime) and the maturation
  of its developer tooling. Kulechov contrasts the early, experimental nature of DeFi
  building (like EthLend) with the current robust ecosystem, emphasizing the shift
  from peer-to-peer models to the **pooled liquidity model** that underpins modern
  DeFi success.


  A major theme is the **convergence of Traditional Finance (TradFi) and DeFi**. Kulechov
  envisions a future where banks and FinTechs utilize DeFi protocols like Aave as
  decentralized, trustworthy backend infrastructure—a concept he terms **"DeFi-walled"**—while
  maintaining centralized front-ends and distribution. This is being actively pursued
  through Aave’s **Horizon platform**, which focuses on onboarding Real-World Assets
  (RWAs) as collateral for stablecoin borrowing. Kulechov stresses that tokenization
  only gains value when paired with practical use cases like lending.


  Kulechov also offered a preview of **Aave V4**, signaling a major step toward making
  the infrastructure more seamless, particularly for institutional adoption. He also
  noted that some new treasury management companies are currently leveraging Aave
  to gain "free leverage" by borrowing at rates lower than their yield.


  Regarding scaling strategy, Kulechov supports Ethereum''s current direction: scaling
  the L1 while allowing specialized Alt-L1s (like Solana) to handle specific use cases,
  noting that Aave’s largest growth remains on the Ethereum mainnet. He also shared
  his past criticisms of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) for not sufficiently prioritizing
  and signaling support for DeFi, a flagship use case, especially following the chaos
  of 2022 (FTX, Celsius collapses), which drove significant user migration to non-custodial
  alternatives.

  ### Key Insights Breakdown:


  **1. Focus Area**: Cryptocurrency and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), specifically
  focusing on the long-term viability of the Ethereum blockchain, the evolution of
  lending protocols, and the integration of TradFi via tokenization.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   The shift in DeFi lending from early peer-to-peer models to the **pooled liquidity
  model** (inspired by Uniswap) as the foundation for network effects and scale.

  *   The maturation of Ethereum’s developer tooling, which significantly simplifies
  building and testing complex financial applications compared to 2017/2018.

  *   Aave is doubling down on L1 success while acknowledging the role of specialized
  Alt-L1s for specific scaling needs.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   Strong conviction that **"On-chain does it better,"** suggesting decentralized
  infrastructure will eventually become conventional wisdom for financial services.

  *   The **"DeFi-walled"** model presents a major opportunity for FinTechs and banks
  to adopt DeFi infrastructure (e.g., automated risk management via smart contracts)
  without fully decentralizing their customer-facing operations.

  *   Tokenization of RWAs is only valuable when integrated with DeFi use cases, such
  as borrowing stablecoins against those assets (via Aave Horizon).


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Stani Kulechov (Aave Founder)**: Central figure, highly bullish on ETH and
  DeFi infrastructure.

  *   **Aave**: The largest lending protocol, currently focused on L1 scaling and
  RWA integration.

  *   **Ethereum Foundation (EF)**: Discussed in the context of its evolving role
  and Kulechov''s past critique regarding its under-involvement in promoting DeFi.

  *   **Horizon**: Aave’s platform specifically designed to bridge TradFi and DeFi
  by onboarding RWAs.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   Implied that the resilience of decentralized systems (proven during 2022 collapses)
  offers a superior, more trustworthy alternative to opaque centralized entities,
  which may influence future regulatory acceptance of DeFi rails.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  *   The future of finance involves centralized entities (banks, FinTechs) using
  decentralized, automated, and transparent DeFi protocols as their core operational
  infrastructure.

  *   Aave V4 is expected to further streamline this infrastructure for institutional
  use.


  **7. Target Audience**: Crypto/DeFi professionals, blockchain developers, institutional
  investors looking at RWA tokenization, and long-term Ethereum ecosystem participants.'
