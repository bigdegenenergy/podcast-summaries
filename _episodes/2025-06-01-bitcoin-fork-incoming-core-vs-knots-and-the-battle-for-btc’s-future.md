summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Bitcoin Fork Incoming? Core vs Knots and the
  Battle for BTC’s Future


  This 23-minute podcast episode explores the current tensions within the Bitcoin
  community, focusing on a controversial proposal regarding the `OP_RETURN` function,
  the philosophical divide between Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots implementations,
  and the looming, existential threat of quantum computing. The host, Guy, assesses
  the likelihood of a hard fork resulting from these issues.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Bitcoin protocol governance, technical policy changes,
  and long-term security risks**. Key themes include the debate over on-chain data
  storage (Ordinals/Inscriptions), the historical context of Bitcoin block size wars,
  and the potential impact of quantum computing on cryptographic security.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **OP\_RETURN Policy Change:** Bitcoin Core developers plan to remove the 80-byte
  limit on the `OP_RETURN` function (used for attaching small, unspendable data to
  transactions). They opted for complete removal (Option C) over raising the cap (Option
  B) to align default policy with existing network workarounds and simplify relay
  paths, arguing the existing cap is ineffective.

  *   **Standardness vs. Consensus Rules:** The removal of the `OP_RETURN` cap is
  a **standardness rule** adjustment, governing transaction relay, not a **consensus
  rule**, which defines block validity. This means the change does not technically
  require network-wide consensus to be implemented by Core nodes, fueling community
  friction.

  *   **Quantum Threat Mechanics:** Quantum computers threaten Bitcoin via their ability
  to exponentially increase computational power using **qubits** (which can be 1 and
  0 simultaneously). Cracking Bitcoin''s SHA256 encryption is theoretically possible
  with around 8,000 logical qubits, a threshold that is not yet met but is considered
  an eventual inevitability.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Fork Likelihood & Impact:** The current OP\_RETURN dispute between Core and
  Knots is deemed unlikely to cause a hard fork because the disagreement is policy-based,
  and both clients will still validate the same chain. A resulting fork would likely
  be a "flop."

  *   **Quantum Risk to Supply:** Approximately **3.8 million BTC** are potentially
  vulnerable to theft by future quantum computers because they reside in legacy wallets
  whose keys cannot be easily upgraded to post-quantum cryptography. This potential
  dump could severely crash BTC''s price and confidence.

  *   **Cost Efficiency of Data Storage:** Workarounds for storing data larger than
  80 bytes (like Marathon’s controversial Slipstream service) are reportedly four
  times cheaper than using the `OP_RETURN` function, suggesting that even if the cap
  is removed, high-volume data spam is financially disincentivized.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Bitcoin Core Developers:** The primary group pushing for the removal of the
  `OP_RETURN` limit, arguing for modernization and discouraging harmful workarounds.

  *   **Bitcoin Knots (Luke Dashjr):** An alternative node implementation maintained
  independently, which opposes the `OP_RETURN` change, viewing it as inviting spam
  and deviating from Bitcoin’s monetary purpose.

  *   **Casey Rodarmor:** Creator of the Ordinals and Inscriptions protocols, whose
  innovations spurred the current debate over on-chain data usage.

  *   **Satoshi Nakamoto:** Mentioned historically regarding the initial 1MB block
  size limit and his early alignment with "small blockers."


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion highlights the inherent governance challenge in decentralized systems:
  how to implement necessary technical upgrades (like quantum resistance) without
  consensus. The potential solution—a hard fork mandating migration to quantum-proof
  wallets—raises profound policy questions about **immutability vs. security**, potentially
  requiring the community to choose between destroying core principles (e.g., reclaiming
  lost BTC) or accepting catastrophic loss.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests two diverging paths:

  1.  **Short-Term Stability:** The immediate governance conflict (Core vs. Knots)
  will likely resolve peacefully, reinforcing the dominance of Bitcoin Core policy
  despite ideological opposition.

  2.  **Long-Term Existential Threat:** The industry faces an inevitable choice regarding
  quantum computing: either accept the theft of millions of BTC or implement a hard
  fork that fundamentally alters Bitcoin’s core ethos of self-sovereignty and immutability.
  The host leans toward accepting the theft as the "lesser of two evils."


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **experienced cryptocurrency investors, Bitcoin
  maximalists, blockchain developers, and industry analysts** interested in protocol
  governance, security implications, and the long-term philosophical direction of
  the Bitcoin network.'
