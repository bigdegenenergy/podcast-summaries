    of liquid staking, which was nonexistent on Solana then, but I knew the concept

  topic: DeFi/Technology
- impact_reason: Shows the necessary pivot from a retail-focused DeFi product (mSOL)
    to building institutional-grade security and compliance layers.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The other one is that the whole institutional part of Marinade was truly something
    that we started to incubate, if you will, because mSOL, the first liquid staking
    token out there on Solana, has been there for a while, and people know especially
    that part. But about a year ago, we started on this journey towards institutional
    and trying to make sure that Marinade is safe and secure also for institutions.

    adoption: perceived smart contract risk vs. the convenience of native, delegated
    staking.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And we got great answers. We got that look, there is a smart contract risk,
    there is delegation built already in the protocol. I can click a button and I
    delegate my Solana as little as one SOL to any of those 1,000 running validators.
    So I don't need to do it myself. And there are up to two days at the cooldown
    period. It wasn't that bad.

  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Marinade introduced a second product called Marinade Native. It completely
    eliminated the smart contract risk. So the Marinade Native just sits on top of
    classic Solana staking in the sense that it only diversifies staking to multiple
    validators, but at no point can touch the underlying Solana because there is separation
    of powers.

    used to monetize the native staking product by charging validators, not stakers.
  relevance_score: 10

    to make sure that this upside is shared back to stakers through this open market.

    reduces the necessity and competitive advantage of LSDs compared to chains like
    Ethereum.

  topic: DeFi/Risk Perception
- impact_reason: Quantifies the hidden cost of staking via validators who capture
    priority fees/MEV, revealing a significant, previously opaque yield drag for stakers.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The priority fees that are 100% captured by the validator, they were equivalent
    to 1% to 2% annualized yield on the staking rewards. So as a staker, you were
    missing on 1% to 2% staking rewards and you were just not aware because no one
    was really talking about it.

    all those asset managers and ETFs. That's first. So compliance, security comes
    first. And then yield only.

    solving the priority fee distribution problem for delegators, showcasing DeFi
    solutions to infrastructure limitations.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: You capture the priority fees, which cannot be captured by staking in a native
    way unless you stake with Marinade because we did this stake auction marketplace
    that allows to share the priority fees to stakers.

    that plagued early Ethereum DeFi, directly motivating the search for alternatives

    non-US crypto teams needing to engage with US institutional capital and ecosystem

  text: One was that most of the Marinade contributors would be based out of Europe,

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: The Future of Staking On Solana | Michael Repetný
  (Marinade Labs)


  This 65-minute episode features an in-depth conversation with Michael Repetný, CEO
  of Marinade Labs, focusing on the evolution, strategy, and future of staking infrastructure
  on the Solana blockchain, particularly contrasting liquid staking with native staking
  solutions.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Solana Staking Infrastructure and Decentralized Finance
  (DeFi)**. Key topics include the origin and evolution of Marinade, the mechanics
  of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) like mSOL, the development of native staking solutions
  (Marinade Native), validator economics, and the strategic pivot toward institutional
  adoption.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Marinade Native Architecture:** This product was specifically designed to
  eliminate smart contract risk associated with LSTs by diversifying stake across
  numerous validators while maintaining separation of power, ensuring Marinade itself
  cannot touch the underlying SOL.

  *   **Stake Auction Marketplace Mechanics:** Marinade introduced a system where
  validators bid for stake delegation. Marinade takes a cut from the flow of these
  bids (which represent shared upside like priority fees or MEV capture), allowing
  validators to compete for stake by sharing value back with stakers, thus maximizing
  staker yield.

  *   **MEV/Priority Fee Capture Awareness:** The conversation highlighted that validators
  were capturing significant value (equivalent to 1-2% annualized yield) through priority
  fees without stakers being aware, which motivated Marinade to create mechanisms
  to bring this value back to the staker pool.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Native Staking Dominance on Solana:** Despite the theoretical advantages of
  liquid staking, 90% of staked SOL remains in native staking, indicating a strong
  market preference for avoiding smart contract risk, especially among institutional
  players.

  *   **LST Saturation vs. Native Opportunity:** The liquid staking market on Solana
  is highly crowded (with many LSTs), capturing only about 10% of the total staked
  supply. Marinade sees significantly more growth potential in the native staking
  segment.

  *   **Institutional Adoption Hurdles:** Attracting institutions requires extensive
  effort, including SOC2 audits, compliance checks, legal structuring, and long-term
  relationship building, which is vastly different from the self-service retail DeFi
  model.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Marinade Labs/Michael Repetný:** The core focus, detailing their journey from
  a hackathon project to a major Solana staking provider.

  *   **Solana Foundation/Serum Foundation:** Provided early critical funding ($80k
  grant) that allowed Marinade to bootstrap post-hackathon.

  *   **Triton (Marco):** One of the current co-founders of Triton (an RPC provider)
  was an early core contributor to Marinade via a merger with another hackathon project,
  Smartpool.

  *   **Lido:** Mentioned as the primary playbook/competitor for liquid staking that
  Marinade initially sought to emulate.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched upon compliance as a major factor for institutional adoption.
  Institutions face hurdles related to **tax triggers** associated with converting
  SOL to LSDs and concerns over **pooling assets** with unknown participants, making
  native staking often preferable from a compliance standpoint.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the Solana staking future will be characterized by a **bifurcation**:

  1.  **Liquid Staking (mSOL):** Will continue to serve users prioritizing immediate
  DeFi composability, though the market is saturated.

  2.  **Native Staking (Marinade Native):** Is expected to capture the majority of
  future growth, driven by institutions and risk-averse users who prioritize security
  and maximizing yield through diversified, non-custodial delegation.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Solana ecosystem participants, DeFi infrastructure
  developers, staking service providers, institutional crypto investors, and product
  managers** focused on decentralized finance and asset security.'
