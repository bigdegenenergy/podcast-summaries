summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Trump''s Plan Will Crush Bitcoin (Why Crypto
  Will DUMP)


  This 57-minute episode, hosted by Dezi and Josh, focused heavily on the immediate
  bearish technical signals in the cryptocurrency market, attributing potential downturns
  to geopolitical uncertainty linked to former President Donald Trump''s foreign policy
  stance, alongside broader macro factors. The central narrative was that Bitcoin
  dominance is currently absorbing liquidity, leaving altcoins vulnerable, and that
  significant macro events could trigger a sharp correction.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus was **Cryptocurrency Market Analysis**, specifically:

  *   **Bitcoin (BTC) Price Action:** Analyzing recent sharp pump-and-dump cycles,
  dominance shifts, and key support/resistance levels.

  *   **Altcoin Performance:** Discussing the stagnation of Ethereum (ETH) relative
  to BTC and the performance of specific DeFi/L2 projects.

  *   **Macroeconomic Influence:** Deep dive into how geopolitical events (Iran/Israel
  conflict) and potential policy shifts under a Trump presidency are driving market
  uncertainty and impacting risk assets.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin Dominance Absorption:** Bitcoin is currently absorbing liquidity from
  altcoins, indicating institutional preference for BTC until market certainty returns,
  suggesting altseason is delayed.

  *   **Key BTC Price Levels:** The market is currently split 50/50 between a potential
  drop to **$94,000** (near realized price/futures gaps) and a rise to **$114,000**.
  Futures gaps at $96K and $91.8K are noted as potential short-term targets if selling
  pressure continues.

  *   **Holiday Volatility Warning:** Historical data suggests that the Fourth of
  July weekend often coincides with low liquidity and high volatility/red candles,
  making the current geopolitical uncertainty particularly dangerous.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Portfolio Strategy:** Hosts strongly reiterated the necessity of maintaining
  a **50/25/25 portfolio** (implied BTC/ETH/Alts) for resilience in the current Bitcoin-dominated,
  uncertain market.

  *   **Trading Focus:** The current environment favors low-leverage trading on consistent
  assets like BTC and ETH rather than speculative altcoin accumulation, which is currently
  "bleeding."

  *   **ETF Impact:** BlackRock ETFs now hold 6.12% of the total Bitcoin supply, indicating
  significant institutional accumulation, though recent ETF flows have slowed by 60%
  since April.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump:** Central to the title; his reported two-week timeline for deciding
  on escalating US involvement in the Middle East conflict is cited as a major source
  of near-term market uncertainty.

  *   **Vitalik Buterin:** Mentioned humorously for his non-committal response (dancing)
  when asked about the state of Ethereum, reflecting ETH''s current stagnant price
  action against BTC.

  *   **MicroStrategy:** Mentioned in the context of a misleading news report regarding
  a 16 billion email credential leak, which was clarified as old, aggregated data,
  not a new hack.

  *   **AeroDrome:** Discussed as a high-potential DeFi project, noted as the "liquidity
  hub for Coinbase," with hosts maintaining a bullish long-term outlook despite short-term
  pullbacks.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Geopolitical Policy Risk:** The primary policy concern is the potential for
  US military intervention in the Middle East, which, if enacted within the next two
  weeks, is expected to spike oil prices, increase inflation fears, and negatively
  impact risk assets like crypto (similar to how trade war discussions affected Fed
  rate cut expectations).

  *   **Tariffs:** The potential for Trump to extend tariffs (possibly around July
  4th) is noted as another macro lever that can shift expectations for Federal Reserve
  policy (e.g., rate cuts).


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the immediate future of crypto is highly dependent on
  **macro events**, specifically geopolitical de-escalation or escalation over the
  next two weeks. Until this uncertainty clears, Bitcoin dominance will likely remain
  high, and altcoins will struggle. The hosts remain cautious about an immediate "altseason"
  during the summer months, contingent on macro stability.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Active Crypto Traders and Professional Investors**
  who need detailed technical analysis, an understanding of on-chain metrics (like
  transaction size dominance), and insight into how geopolitical risk factors are
  being priced into digital assets.'
