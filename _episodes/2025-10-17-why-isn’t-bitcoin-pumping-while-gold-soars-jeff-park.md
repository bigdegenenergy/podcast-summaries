    government uses Bitcoin as collateral, leading potentially to a ''Central Bank

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So to draw an equivalence of that in Bitcoin terms, the same would be if the
    US government actually acquired a bunch of Bitcoin, but eventually needs to borrow
    more than it can and needs to start pledging Bitcoin somewhere to borrow that
    money. And then the debt actually then becomes kind of larger than anything that
    it can be paid back for. And then it becomes kind of like nationalized in the
    construct of like the role of that asset.
  topic: adoption/strategy

    the Treasury's function. But the central bank is on the other side of it. And
    it's so obvious to anyone who's understood history that those two things and functions
    are absolutely related, which is why I think this notion of Fed dependence, we
    need to kind of move beyond it.
  topic: Regulation/Strategy

    peer into it, they don't like what they see. Oh, you mean all the tribalism and
    battling and, you know, like when Bitcoiners fight other Bitcoiners about like
    the spam filter, for example, even if it's coming from a good place, it exposes

    between the fiscal (Treasury) and monetary (Central Bank) arms, contrasting with
    modern narratives of strict independence.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why Isn’t Bitcoin Pumping While Gold Soars?
  | Jeff Park


  This 41-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast features Anthony Pompliano (Pomp) interviewing
  Jeff Park, CIO of ProCAP BTC, for a macro world tour focusing on global financial
  instability, the role of the US Dollar, and the divergent performance of Gold versus
  Bitcoin.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Global Macroeconomics and Digital Assets**. Key themes
  include the mechanics of the dollarized global economy (swap lines, FX intervention),
  geopolitical risks (Argentina, China), the historical role of reserve assets (Gold
  vs. SDRs), and the current market puzzle of Gold outperforming Bitcoin despite favorable
  conditions for risk assets.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **SDRs as a Precursor to Bitcoin:** Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), the IMF''s
  basket currency, are discussed as a historical attempt at a neutral reserve asset,
  drawing parallels to Bitcoin''s potential role as a superior, non-fiat-backed collateral
  asset for international plumbing.

  *   **Swap Lines Mechanics:** The conversation detailed the function of central
  bank swap lines—cross-currency swaps used to provide dollar liquidity during systemic
  fractures, highlighting the US Treasury''s Exchange Stabilization Facility (ESF)
  which primarily holds SDRs.

  *   **Bitcoin as Pristine Collateral:** Park suggests Bitcoin’s future utility at
  the nation-state level might be as *pristine collateral* that can be pledged, lent,
  and borrowed, moving beyond its current perception as merely a store of value.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Gold''s Current Dominance:** Gold is currently sucking market attention due
  to its perceived certainty and role as a psychological safe haven amidst global
  chaos (Argentina, China). Central bank involvement (e.g., Shanghai Futures Exchange
  accumulation) is seen as a major, long-lasting driver for gold flows.

  *   **Bitcoin Laggard Status:** Despite expected rate cuts and strong global liquidity,
  Bitcoin is lagging, which Park finds disappointing but suggests may be due to the
  market prioritizing Gold''s established history as a reserve asset over Bitcoin''s
  potential.

  *   **Liquidity and Risk Assets:** Generally, increased credit creation and liquidity
  (seen in China''s regional stimulus) remain positive drivers for risk assets, including
  Bitcoin, assuming fiscal dominance continues.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jeff Park (ProCAP BTC):** The guest, providing the CIO perspective on macro
  trends and asset allocation.

  *   **Javier Milei:** Mentioned as the Argentine President whose rapid, painful
  devaluation policies have yet to deliver a convincing long-term growth story, leading
  to renewed populist pressure.

  *   **Janet Yellen (US Treasury Secretary):** Referenced regarding the Treasury''s
  use of the ESF and SDRs to intervene in the Argentine Peso market.

  *   **Bank of England:** Used as a historical case study to illustrate the arc of
  a central bank evolving from a private, gold-backed entity to a nationalized apparatus
  when government debt (250% Debt-to-GDP) becomes unmanageable.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **FX Intervention and Taxpayer Risk:** The discussion touched on the controversial
  nature of the US Treasury using taxpayer funds (via the ESF) to buy the failing
  Argentine Peso, questioning the political and financial wisdom of intervening in
  foreign fiat markets over domestic crypto adoption.

  *   **Capital vs. Current Account Wars:** Geopolitical trade disputes (US/China)
  are evolving into "capital wars," where nations negotiate terms related to capital
  flows and investment access, tying into the necessity of stable reserve assets.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that the plumbing of the global dollarized economy is
  being tested, forcing nations to look beyond the dollar and the SDR. Bitcoin''s
  future utility may be realized first at the **B2B or nation-state level** as a liquid,
  transactional currency and collateral, rather than immediate retail adoption for
  coffee purchases. The historical precedent of Gold suggests that central bank adoption
  is the most critical catalyst for an asset''s long-term success as a reserve.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto/Digital Asset Investors, Macro Hedge Fund Managers, and Financial Professionals**
  interested in the intersection of global monetary policy, geopolitical risk, and
  asset performance divergence.'
