    since the GPT-5 release.
  topic: business
- impact_reason: Highlights a significant practical improvement in AI agent/connector
    functionality, moving from theoretical capability ('deep research only') to real-time
    utility ('instant updates').
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Gmail and Google Calendar on autopilot as connectors. So previously these
    had to be deep research only, which wasn't really useful, but now you can get
    instant updates from your Gmail and Google Calendar once you've connected it.
  topic: technical

    ''Personality'' feature: mitigating the ''yes-man'' problem (over-compliance)
    observed in previous models.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think these personalities were actually ways to address some of the mounting
    pressures of the sometimes-too-compliant GPT-4, right? So there was a period—they
    corrected it a little bit—but GPT-4 essentially got to the point where it's just
    agreeing with you, right? Regardless of what you say, it's just your hype man,
    and it's not it wasn't always helpful, right?
  topic: safety
- impact_reason: Actionable advice on using system prompts/custom instructions specifically
    for mitigating hallucinations by demanding metacognitive output (confidence scores).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The only custom instructions I've ever used are essentially a set of like
    zero fabrication instructions, right? So try to cut down on hallucinations, to
    keep the answers clean, and then to also force with every single answer to force
    ChatGPT to give me a confidence score and a reason for it...
  topic: Safety/Practical Lessons
- impact_reason: 'Critical technical limitation discovered: Advanced voice mode within
    Custom GPTs currently fails to utilize internal tooling (like code interpreters
    or file access), relying only on basic web retrieval.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: However, I was doing a lot of testing on the voice mode inside of custom GPTs,
    and it doesn't work how you might want it to. That's because aside from web retrieval,
    most of GPT-5's custom tooling—so all the fun scaffolding—doesn't work.
  topic: Technical Limitations/Product Flaws
- impact_reason: 'A severe warning about a specific failure mode: voice mode in custom
    GPTs will confidently lie about accessing uploaded files, presenting a major safety/reliability
    issue for users relying on file context.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Downside is it doesn't know that, and it will hallucinate hard. This is one
    of the most blatant hallucination kind of problems that OpenAI probably—I would
    assume they don't know about it, otherwise they should have fixed it and patched
    it.

    the single most anticipated feature update, indicating its high strategic value
    for professional users.

    instructions: lack of scope control, forcing users to choose between applying
    rules everywhere or nowhere.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So one of the biggest problems with custom instructions was well, they applied
    unilaterally to every single chat. You couldn't turn them off or on on a different
    chat. It's well, you either use it for literally everything or literally nothing.
  topic: Technical Limitations
- impact_reason: Provides a critical, actionable warning about the non-editable nature
    of memory settings once a project is initialized, preventing user frustration.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So now there's custom instructions. It's a little tricky though. So you have
    to kind of do this the right way. So don't just go in and create a project and
    start chatting because once you start that, you cannot change the memory.
  topic: practical advice/product usage
- impact_reason: Gives specific, step-by-step instructions on how to access the hidden
    configuration (the gear icon) necessary for setting up scoped memory correctly.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So before you literally even create the project, go find the gear icon, and
    then you have to set the memory.
  topic: practical advice/product usage
- impact_reason: 'Clearly defines the two crucial memory scoping options: global access
    vs. isolated, private memory for the project, which is vital for data segregation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It says, "Project can access memories from outside chats and vice versa,"
    or "Project only." So it says, "The project can access only access its own memories.
    Its memories are hidden from outside chats."

    (like ChatGPT) and suggests that even expert users are missing key functionality
    due to noise.

  text: Even if you're a power user of ChatGPT, there have been a dozen or so extremely
    useful and powerful features that OpenAI has added over the last few weeks that
    I think almost everyone missed.

    a major release can completely overshadow positive product updates, impacting
    feature adoption.

    of previously stable models, which disrupts established workflows and user reliance.'

  text: And then they got rid of all of these old models that people really cared
    about and they relied on for their day-to-day use, such as GPT-4o.

    task completion (spending less time) to personalized, enhanced learning.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I use large language models to learn things in a better way and way more highly
    personalized, right? So obviously, you get to combine all the different powers
    and capabilities of ChatGPT to first of all pull in this information.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: Crucial clarification on the scope of the personality feature—it
    affects *style and tone*, not the underlying safety guardrails or capabilities.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Changing the personality does not affect what ChatGPT can or cannot do or
    the rules it follows for safety, right?

- impact_reason: Directly addresses user nostalgia for GPT-4o's conversational style
    by recommending the 'Listener' personality as a substitute for decision support.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Listener. So if you're missing the, you know, warmness on the back and forth
    of GPT-4o, maybe go try Listener. So this is warm, calm, and reflective with gentle
    clarifying questions. Great for decision support, planning, and when you want
    a thoughtful sounding board.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: Clarifies the interoperability between the new Personality settings
    and the existing Custom Instructions (system prompt), which is vital for advanced
    configuration.
  relevance_score: 9

    your custom instructions, so they can still work hand in hand.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: Illustrates the ongoing complexity and rapid iteration of LLM deployment
    modes (Auto, Instant, Thinking, etc.) and confirms that user control over verbosity/style
    is a key feature.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So if you've been using the new GPT-5, right, whether you're kind of regardless
    of what mode you're using—and yes, OpenAI keeps changing the mode names, so now
    you have Auto, Instant, Thinking, Mid-Thinking, and Pro—sometimes you're like,
    "This is way too wordy," or "This is too short," right? So these are great different
    personality modes that you can put in there.
  topic: AI Technology Trends
- impact_reason: 'Crucial insight into the layered configuration of LLM behavior:
    personalities and custom instructions are additive, not mutually exclusive.'
  relevance_score: 9

    you can still have your custom instructions, so they can still work hand in hand.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: EP 599: 5 New Overlooked ChatGPT Features You
  Should Be Using But Aren’t


  This episode of the Everyday AI Show, hosted by Jordan Wilson, focuses on five powerful,
  yet largely ignored, new features recently added to ChatGPT. The host argues that
  these crucial updates have been overshadowed by the intense media focus surrounding
  the launch of GPT-5 and subsequent competitive releases from Google. The goal is
  to highlight these practical, actionable features that can significantly enhance
  user productivity and personalization within the platform.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **new, underutilized features within the ChatGPT interface
  and ecosystem**, specifically covering personalization, learning tools, voice interaction,
  and integration capabilities.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Quiz GPT/Flashcard Generation:** A hidden or poorly documented feature allows
  users to prompt ChatGPT to create interactive, multiple-choice quizzes or flashcards
  based on provided context or general knowledge, functioning as an in-chat learning
  tool superior to current NotebookLM capabilities in interactivity.

  *   **Advanced Voice Mode Limitations in GPTs:** While Advanced Voice Mode is now
  available within Custom GPTs, a significant technical flaw exists: the voice mode
  currently **fails to access or utilize uploaded files** within the GPT, leading
  to severe hallucinations when users expect file-based information retrieval via
  voice.

  *   **Gmail/Calendar Connectors Shift:** The integration connectors for Google services
  have moved from requiring "Deep Research" mode (which incurred long wait times)
  to operating **instantly in Auto mode**, making them viable for real-time productivity
  tasks like email triage.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Personalization for Enterprise Adoption:** The introduction of customizable
  **Personalities** (Cynic, Robot, Listener, Nerd) addresses the common business complaint
  of overly compliant AI, allowing organizations to tailor the AI''s tone to match
  internal communication styles or specific project needs, potentially increasing
  adoption.

  *   **Productivity ROI via Integration:** The instant connectivity to Gmail and
  Calendar offers a direct path to ROI for knowledge workers struggling with email
  overload, allowing AI to instantly prioritize and draft responses, a capability
  previously forcing users toward competitors like Claude.

  *   **Structured Project Management:** The long-awaited ability to apply **Custom
  Instructions on a per-project basis** (via the Projects feature) solves a major
  workflow bottleneck, enabling users to maintain distinct system prompts for different
  clients or business units without manual toggling.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **OpenAI:** The developer responsible for the new features and the context of
  the GPT-5 launch backlash.

  *   **Google (Gemini Live):** Mentioned as the competitor currently dominating headlines,
  particularly in the voice interaction space.

  *   **NotebookLM:** Referenced as a popular Google tool lacking the interactive
  flashcard functionality now present in ChatGPT.

  *   **Claude:** Mentioned as a competitor whose superior Gmail/Calendar integration
  was a key reason users stuck with it until the recent ChatGPT update.

  *   **Jordan Wilson (Host):** The source of the actionable advice, emphasizing personalized
  learning over simple output generation with LLMs.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a move toward **deeper, more granular control over the
  LLM''s behavior and output style**, moving beyond simple prompt engineering to built-in
  system controls (Personalities, Project-specific Instructions). The industry is
  heading toward more integrated, personalized, and context-aware AI assistants, though
  interoperability issues (like the voice mode bug) remain a challenge.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **AI Power Users, Business Leaders, and Productivity
  Professionals** who already use ChatGPT daily but may have missed recent, subtle
  updates that offer significant workflow enhancements.

  ### Comprehensive Narrative Summary


  The podcast episode addresses the phenomenon of powerful new ChatGPT features being
  overlooked due to the chaotic rollout of GPT-5 and subsequent competitive noise
  from Google. Host Jordan Wilson details five specific updates that he believes users,
  even power users, are missing out on.


  The first feature discussed is **Flashcard/Quiz Generation (Quiz GPT)**, which creates
  interactive quizzes within the chat, a highly requested learning tool that surpasses
  competitors like NotebookLM in interactivity. Next, the host covers **Custom Personalities**
  (Cynic, Robot, Listener, Nerd), suggesting these were introduced to combat the overly
  agreeable nature of previous models by allowing users to enforce specific tones
  and behaviors, which can be layered with existing Custom Instructions.


  Feature number three is the **Advanced Voice Mode Updates**, noting its expanded
  access for free users and its integration into Custom GPTs. However, Wilson issues
  a critical warning: while the voice mode sounds more human and is faster, it currently
  suffers from a major technical flaw where it **cannot access uploaded files within
  a GPT**, leading to guaranteed hallucinations if relied upon for file-specific queries.


  The fourth overlooked feature is the **Instant Gmail and Google Calendar Connectors**.
  This is a major productivity shift because the connectors now work instantly in
  Auto mode, eliminating the need for the slow Deep Research mode previously required.
  This update allows ChatGPT to triage emails and calendar items in real-time, directly
  competing with features previously driving users to Claude.


  Finally, the number one most important overlooked feature is the long-awaited **Custom
  Instructions for Projects**. Previously, custom instructions applied universally,
  forcing users to choose between applying them everywhere or nowhere. Now, users
  can create distinct sets of system prompts (e.g., brand voice, citation requirements)
  that apply only to specific project folders, allowing for true multi-client or multi-business
  use without manual prompt overrides.


  The overall message is that while the industry focuses on headline model releases,
  OpenAI is quietly rolling out crucial interface and integration improvements that
  offer immediate, practical gains in personalization and workflow efficiency.'
