    AI (insight/prediction) and Agentic AI (insight + action/orchestration). Crucial
    for understanding the shift.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The best way to think about it is that we've implemented healthcare organizations
    that implemented AI, machine learning specifically in a variety of different ways...
    that AI has been great at informing you and providing you with insight. And the
    ability for AI to act on that insight is where agentic AI comes into play. And
    that's the big difference between the traditional AI and the agentic AI.

    for agentic AI, starting with the necessary infrastructure foundation.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We look at it from three layers of value essentially and the first layer is
    a foundational capability and that's your AI platform. That's where your data
    infrastructure, your cloud infrastructure, your machine learning operations, your
    APIs, your governance capabilities, your policy handling...

- impact_reason: 'Defines the crucial second layer: the Agentic AI Platform, emphasizing
    its modularity and cross-system orchestration capabilities.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: On top of that, there is this emerging area... We call that the agentic AI
    platform. This is where things get started, get interesting. Think of the agentic
    AI platform as a modular architecture that gives agents the ability not just to
    analyze, but then to add, recommend and add intelligently across systems and boundaries
    essentially.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: Uses a powerful analogy (brain/hands and legs) to explain the relationship
    between the core agent logic and external tools/APIs necessary for execution.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is really interesting where agents can essentially think of agents as
    a brain. But it needs hands and legs to do things. And the way to think about
    those hands and legs is that these are tools that can be attached to make the
    agent really more domain-centric.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: You want agents to be able to audit. You want to be able to audit agents as
    to how are they making those decisions, are recommendations that they are right?
    And the way to do that is to log everything they're doing so that you can then
    analyze that effectively. Number one.
  topic: safety/governance
- impact_reason: Provides a powerful, concise re-framing of AI agents' role—they don't
    just automate steps; they fundamentally change the structure and flow of work.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Think of agents as not just automation, they are simply workflow transformers.
  topic: business/strategy
- impact_reason: A concrete, high-impact use case demonstrating massive efficiency
    gains (45 min to 2-5 min) in healthcare coordination, illustrating the value proposition
    of agentic AI.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We've built an agent that prepares service plans for high-risk members. It
    reads the intake notes, pulls history from the EHR, compares the eligibility rules,
    checks against prior interventions, and then drafts a care plan that's been for
    review by the nurse. What's used to take 45 minutes per member can now be done
    in two to five minutes.
  topic: predictions/business
- impact_reason: 'A key strategic insight: the primary value of agents in complex
    fields like healthcare is reducing cognitive load and manual data integration
    for professionals, not replacing them.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: That's where I believe the agent is really shine, not in a place in clinicians,
    but in unburdening them from stitching systems together manually just to make
    them arrive at the right decisions.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: 'Offers a crucial starting strategy: prioritize high-impact, low-risk
    projects that avoid sensitive data (PII) initially to gain quick wins and avoid
    immediate foundational infrastructure hurdles.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The service client one doesn't need to include PII in the beginning, where
    you're just assisting your service plan coordinators, for example, in just being
    very efficient at creating a more accurate at creating service plans. And that
    doesn't have to include PII. So that's high impact. It's highly feasible because
    it doesn't require massive investment in any foundation layer, for example.
  topic: business/strategy

    built sequentially upon prior AI stages (deterministic -> generative). It suggests
    agentic capabilities can be deployed independently or earlier.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: this isn't a layer, no pun intended, on top of generative AI. You don't need
    to go through deterministic use cases to get to, and then generative AI use cases

    These are essentially those domain tools that you've been investing in. So imagine
    that you've got a predictive algorithm that is great at doing risk stratification...
    But AI agents can change that. So you can essentially say, hey, I have this model

    across multiple systems, contrasting sharply with brittle, rules-based automation
    in claims processing.

  text: A second example addresses pre-adjudication claims to be achieved. So here,
    instead of routing every claim into a manual queue, an agent pre-triage claims,
    checks for documentation gaps, it flags prior out mismatches, summarizes questionable
    items for the adjuster. And it does this by weaving through four or five systems
    using memory and reasoning, not hard-coded rules.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Building Readiness for AI Agents in Healthcare Systems


  This 33-minute episode of the AI and Business Podcast, featuring **Raheel Retiwalla,
  CSO of Productive Edge**, focused on defining **Agentic AI** in the context of enterprise
  healthcare and outlining the necessary infrastructure and strategic readiness required
  for its adoption. The core narrative shifted from traditional, insight-providing
  AI to autonomous, action-orchestrating AI agents.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centered on **Agentic AI in Enterprise Healthcare**, specifically
  differentiating it from traditional AI/ML, defining the architectural layers needed
  for deployment, and exploring practical use cases in payer and provider settings
  (e.g., care management, claims processing).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Agentic vs. Traditional AI:** Traditional AI excels at *informing* (e.g.,
  risk stratification alerts), whereas Agentic AI excels at *acting* and *orchestrating*
  the necessary steps based on that insight, significantly reducing manual handoffs
  across organizational silos.

  *   **Three Layers of Readiness:** Readiness requires a layered approach: 1) **Foundational
  Capability** (data/cloud infrastructure, MLOps, governance); 2) **Agentic AI Platform**
  (modular architecture featuring memory, tool use/API orchestration, and policy enforcement);
  and 3) **Healthcare Tools** (existing domain-specific models like risk stratification
  algorithms that agents can tap into).

  *   **Tool Use and Memory:** A critical component of the Agentic AI Platform is
  the ability for agents to possess **memory** (retaining past interactions) and **tool
  use** (connecting to domain-specific APIs, CRMs, or existing predictive models to
  execute tasks).


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Workflow Transformation:** Agentic AI is positioned as a "workflow transformer,"
  not just an automation tool, capable of fundamentally rethinking processes by handling
  complex, multi-step orchestration previously requiring significant human cognitive
  load.

  *   **ROI Through Throughput and Burnout Reduction:** Real-world examples showed
  massive time savings (e.g., care plan drafting reduced from 45 minutes to 2-5 minutes),
  directly impacting operational throughput and mitigating staff burnout.

  *   **Strategic Partnership for Readiness:** Business leaders are advised to partner
  with IT by identifying high-pain, high-manual-work operational use cases and quantifying
  their ROI potential before charting a technical roadmap.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Raheel Retiwalla (Productive Edge):** Provided the expert framework for agentic
  readiness and shared practical healthcare use cases.

  *   **Hyperscale Vendors (Microsoft, Google):** Mentioned as vendors already beginning
  to offer components of the modular Agentic AI Platform.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward AI systems that can autonomously manage complex, cross-system
  workflows. This shift necessitates a focus on **AI Governance**—extending traditional
  data governance to include auditing, instrumentation, observation of agent paths,
  and bias checking—to manage the increased autonomy of these systems.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This content is highly valuable for **Healthcare Technology Leaders (CIOs/CTOs),
  Healthcare Operations Executives (Payers and Providers), and AI Strategy Professionals**
  operating within regulated industries who need to move beyond conceptual generative
  AI to practical, actionable enterprise deployment.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast episode provided a deep dive into the strategic and technical requirements
  for adopting **Agentic AI** within complex healthcare systems, featuring Raheel
  Retiwalla of Productive Edge.


  **Narrative Arc:** The conversation began by establishing the fundamental difference
  between traditional AI (which *informs*) and Agentic AI (which *acts* and *orchestrates*).
  Retiwalla used the example of a high-risk patient alert: traditional AI stops at
  the alert, while an agentic system would automatically draft follow-up scripts,
  schedule appointments, and coordinate necessary actions across disparate systems.
  This capability is poised to "turn workflows on their heads."


  **Key Themes and Technical Concepts:** Retiwalla introduced a crucial **three-layer
  framework for enterprise readiness**:

  1.  **Foundational Capability:** The necessary base layer including robust data
  infrastructure, MLOps, security, and initial governance structures.

  2.  **Agentic AI Platform:** The core innovation layer, characterized by modular
  architecture, **memory** (retaining context), and **tool use** (the "hands and legs"
  that connect to external systems via APIs).

  3.  **Healthcare Tools:** Existing, domain-specific algorithms (e.g., quality coverage
  models) that agents can intelligently leverage.


  **Business Strategy and Governance:** The discussion stressed that agentic AI blurs
  the lines of traditional automation by handling higher-order thinking. For regulated
  industries like healthcare, this autonomy demands enhanced governance. This **AI
  Governance** must build upon existing data governance, focusing on the agent’s ability
  to be **audited**, **instrumented** (to record specific actions), and **observed**
  to ensure transparency and check for bias.


  **Practical Applications:** Several high-impact use cases were detailed:

  *   **Care Management:** Agents drafting comprehensive service plans for high-risk
  members by synthesizing intake notes, EHR history, and eligibility rules, reducing
  preparation time from 45 minutes to under five.

  *   **Claims Pre-Adjudication:** Agents intelligently pre-triaging claims by checking
  documentation gaps and flagging mismatches across multiple systems using reasoning,
  not just hard-coded rules.

  *   **Behavioral Health Follow-up:** Monitoring missed appointments and medication
  lapses, providing care managers with context-rich nudges (e.g., "Member has a refill
  in 12 days; noted mood decline").
