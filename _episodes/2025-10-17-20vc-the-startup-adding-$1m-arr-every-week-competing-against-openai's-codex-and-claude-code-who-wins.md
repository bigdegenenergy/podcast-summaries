    analogy like, oh, open AI takes the word open and apply it to open models.

    to matter is like how good are you getting context in from a company? How good

    like the early investors in OpenAI have got like $5 billion enterprise value right
    now, which is like a 25X for them, which don't get me wrong is amazing, but it's
    actually not like great SaaS businesses will give you 25X. Superbase's early investors
    will have a 25X. That's interesting. And it's because of the dilutive nature of
    the business being it's actually not been such a great venture investment.

    really tried not to replicate that. Like the way I did it with Warp was as I was
    developing the idea, I was talking to a few investors I knew who I'd known for
    a really long time, who just when I was like, I'm ready to do this idea, we're
    like, we love the idea. We want to invest.

summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Warp CEO on AI Coding, Market Dynamics, and Future
  of Engineering


  This 73-minute episode of 20VC features Harry Stabbings in conversation with **Zach
  Lloyd, Founder and CEO of Warp**, a next-generation developer terminal experiencing
  rapid growth, reportedly adding **$1M in net new ARR every week**. The discussion
  was wide-ranging, covering Zach’s experience rewriting Google Docs, the competitive
  landscape of coding AI models, the evolving role of the developer, and the critical
  importance of margins in the AI era.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **General Tech and AI Developer Tools**, specifically analyzing
  the competitive dynamics between major LLMs (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini) in the context
  of coding assistance, the product-market fit of agentic coding tools, and the business
  realities (like margins) of scaling AI-native SaaS companies.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **LLM Performance Hierarchy for Coding:** Internally at Warp, the two leading
  models for coding tasks are **GPT-5 and Claude**, with **Gemini** (currently on
  2.5) lagging behind. Claude is noted for being friendlier, while GPT-5 requires
  more thinking time but often yields high-quality results.

  *   **The Terminal as the Agentic Hub:** Warp has pivoted its focus, asserting that
  the **terminal form factor** is the preferred interface for agentic work, seamlessly
  blending the terminal and IDE experience for prompting, planning, reviewing, and
  shipping code.

  *   **Effective Prompting Requires Context and Understanding:** Successful use of
  AI coding tools in production environments requires developers to provide **specific
  engineering context** (i.e., *how* to build something), moving beyond vague, high-level
  prompts ("build me X"). This necessitates a sophisticated user.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **AI Tool Budget is Elastic:** The budget for developer productivity tools is
  expected to grow exponentially. While traditional tools cost small amounts per seat,
  businesses are willing to pay **orders of magnitude more** for tools that fundamentally
  increase the value of software creation, as every company is now a software company.

  *   **Agentic Tools: Early Enterprise PMF:** While prosumer tools show high usage,
  they suffer from high churn and price sensitivity. In the **enterprise market**,
  the most proven AI tool remains basic **autocomplete** (like Copilot). True agentic
  AI is still considered very early in achieving measurable, aggregate productivity
  gains across professional teams.

  *   **Margins Matter, Especially in Prosumer:** The cost structure of AI products
  is challenging. For prosumer/consumer segments, usage often increases costs, creating
  a perverse incentive where better product-market fit (more usage) worsens unit economics
  unless heavily subsidized as a marketing funnel expense.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Zach Lloyd (Warp):** Former Principal Engineer at Google (led Google Docs
  development), now leading Warp, which is benchmarked highly on SWE Bench and Terminal
  Bench.

  *   **Warp:** A next-generation terminal focused on AI integration, boasting 30X
  revenue growth this year and adoption by 56% of the Fortune 500 engineering teams.

  *   **Google/Gemini:** Criticized for being slow in AI execution despite inventing
  the Transformer architecture. The integration of Gemini into consumer products was
  deemed unimpressive.

  *   **Waymo:** Highlighted as one of the coolest and most impressive products currently
  being developed within Google/Alphabet.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No direct discussion on regulatory frameworks was held, but the conversation touched
  upon the **security implications** of feeding proprietary code into third-party
  AI builders, confirming this is a valid concern for companies handling sensitive
  codebases.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  *   **Fewer, More Senior Engineers:** The future of engineering teams will likely
  involve **fewer engineers overall**, consisting of highly senior, product-minded
  individuals who manage the output of numerous AI agents.

  *   **Role Evolution:** The role most suited to thrive in this AI-augmented future
  is the **product-oriented senior engineer**, as product managers and designers currently
  face a cap on what they can build to production using these tools alone.

  *   **Shift to Automation:** The developer tooling market will bifurcate into **interactive
  productivity tools** (prompting) and **automation tools** (auto-fixing crashes,
  generating PRs), with automation being the more valuable long-term market segment.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Venture Capitalists, Founders, CTOs, and Senior
  Software Engineers** interested in the practical realities, competitive positioning,
  and business viability of the current wave of AI-native developer tooling.'
