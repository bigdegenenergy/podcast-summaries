  text: Insane, insane. Everybody I spoke to was amazed because you get rumors about
    this sort of a thing happening. But to my knowledge, this is the first time I've
    seen it actually written out on a contract for the public to see that it's not
    just that people are shadily selling tokens behind the scenes, they're making
    deals.
  topic: Regulation/Adoption

    allow insiders to profit prematurely at the expense of the community/retail investors.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Movement Foundation... entered into a market-making agreement with a Chinese
    market-making firm called Web3Port, where the long of the short of it... essentially
    this agreement... incentivized what essentially looked like pumping and dumping
    of tokens, where insiders in the project, before a big airdrop, before the circulation
    was really high, would have been able to essentially cash out of their tokens
    early for a quick profit.
  topic: Investment/Adoption
- impact_reason: Details the specific, highly favorable profit-sharing mechanism that
    incentivized the market maker to push the price up to a specific threshold.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If the token reaches that price [FDV of $5 billion], then you, Web3Port, the
    market maker, are allowed to sell those tokens for a 50-50 split, where you give
    us the lender in this case, Rentech or Movement, it's complicated. And the other
    50% goes to Web3Port.
  topic: Investment/DeFi
- impact_reason: Directly labels the contractual incentive structure as market manipulation,
    based on expert consensus.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Experts... tell me this is very clear. It incentivizes price manipulation
    in their view, market manipulation, where there's an incentive to pump up the
    price of the token so that early insiders can dump those tokens at this really
    favorable price range for a 50-50 profit split.
  topic: Regulation
- impact_reason: Reveals a specific, highly problematic clause that attempts to legally
    coerce a project into exchange listings, demonstrating potential external control
    over core project decisions.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The deal looked different. They got rid of certain provisions where it was
    negotiated in part by people like Wassie lawyer... But the provisions they got
    rid of were some of the really striking ones where, for example, there was a provision
    that said, hey, if Movement doesn't list a token on this, or the move token doesn't
    get listed on XYZ exchange, then the person on the other side of this contract,
    the draft contract, Rentech in this case, is allowed to sue Movement for damages,
    which is just a crazy thing, because you're not even supposed to have power as
    a project to get your tokens listed.
  topic: Regulation/DeFi
- impact_reason: A concrete example of alleged market manipulation (dumping tokens
    immediately post-listing without providing liquidity/support), leading to regulatory/exchange
    action.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Binance banned it for was the day after the move token was listed, this wallet
    that got banned, this market maker, sold off $66 million tokens to the market
    for a $38 million profit without any buy orders, corresponding buy orders.
  topic: Investment/Regulation
- impact_reason: 'This is the core conflict: an alleged conflict of interest where
    the Foundation''s General Counsel (YK Pac) is claimed to be the GC for the parent
    company of the deal''s counterparty (Rentech/Autonomy), leading to intense blame-shifting.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Galen says, no, Wassie lawyer, YK, you are the general counsel for Autonomy.
    So of course, I haven't seen any evidence that makes it clear that he knew this.
    But people are clearly trying to distance themselves from this deal.
  topic: Regulation/Legal
- impact_reason: A strong critique of market manipulation tactics (like circumventing
    vesting cliffs and misrepresenting circulating supply/floats) that undermine investor
    trust and fairness in token launches.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: cliffs are there for a reason. And investors don't know these games are being
    played. It's the same with the fake floats, which make the token seem much bigger.
  topic: Investment/Adoption
- impact_reason: This summarizes the core alleged financial engineering—a structure
    allowing insiders/affiliated entities to realize significant, favorable profits,
    raising serious governance and fairness questions.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: All we know is that this was a vehicle that deliberately or not set up a structure
    by which an entity who had Web3Port was able to sell tokens for a 50-50 profit
    split at a favorable valuation at a $5 billion valuation.
  topic: DeFi/Strategy
- impact_reason: Coinbase suspending an asset due to contract review is a significant
    regulatory/custodial signal, suggesting the underlying issues were severe enough
    to warrant immediate risk mitigation.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's a big deal. I mean, it's very rare that in response to anything an asset
    issuer will suspend that asset.
  topic: Regulation/Adoption
- impact_reason: Explicitly states that the contract structure created an incentive
    for market manipulation, which is a universally recognized legal red flag, even
    within the often-gray area of crypto law.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: those contracts to the experts that I spoke to showed at least an incentive
    for market manipulation, which is a big no-no, just legally, even in crypto.

    signed... But there was another agreement that was already signed, that predated
    the December 8th agreement... where Rentech in this contract has entered into
    a separate agreement with Web3Port.
  topic: Technology/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Exposes the inherent structural conflict in many crypto projects:
    the blurring of lines between the development entity (Labs) and the token governance
    entity (Foundation), often done to avoid securities classification.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Movement Labs, again, separate from the token-holding foundation, Rushi...
    is really engaged in discussions and circulated the initial contract for the market-making.
    So he basically was a part of the foundation's deal-making, which is a complicated
    thing.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: How MOVE’s Contracts Put a Pump and Dump Into
  a Legal Agreement - Ep. 828


  This episode of Unchained, hosted by Laura Shin, features Sam Kessler, Deputy Managing
  Editor for Tech and Protocols at CoinDesk, discussing his investigative report on
  the controversial **Movement (MOVE) token launch** and the underlying market-making
  agreements that appear to incentivize market manipulation.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Crypto/Web3**, specifically focusing on token distribution
  mechanisms, market-making agreements, potential market manipulation, corporate governance
  structures within decentralized projects (Labs vs. Foundation), and the immediate
  regulatory fallout following investigative journalism.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Market-Making Abuse:** The core issue revolves around a contract that allegedly
  turned standard market-making into a mechanism for insiders to profit from price
  pumps, undermining standard market integrity.

  *   **Token Vesting Circumvention:** The agreement appears to bypass typical token
  lock-up/vesting schedules designed to prevent early insider dumping, allowing for
  immediate, large-scale liquidation.

  *   **Complex Entity Structure:** The scandal highlights the deliberate complexity
  in crypto project structures (Movement Labs vs. Movement Foundation) often used
  to manage regulatory risk, which in this case, may have obscured accountability.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Real-World Impact of Reporting:** Kessler’s reporting immediately led to significant
  market consequences, including **Coinbase suspending the MOVE token** and Binance
  banning the involved market maker.

  *   **Investor Scrutiny:** The involvement of high-profile, crypto-native VCs (Polychain
  Capital, Coin Fund, Placeholder, etc.) raises questions about due diligence when
  complex, potentially manipulative agreements are signed.

  *   **Incentivized Manipulation:** A specific contract clause incentivized pumping
  the token price to a \$5 billion FDV, after which the market maker could liquidate
  tokens for a 50/50 profit split with the insider entity, a clear red flag for investors.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Movement Foundation/Movement Labs:** The entities behind the MOVE token and
  development, now under internal and external investigation.

  *   **Web3Port:** The Chinese market-making firm Movement *thought* they were contracting
  with.

  *   **Rentech:** The entity that actually signed the market-making contract, allegedly
  representing itself as a Web3Port subsidiary.

  *   **Galen Lachoon:** Stated he is the person behind Rentech (via his company Autonomy)
  and claims the Foundation’s general counsel knew about Rentech’s structure.

  *   **YK Pak (Wassie Lawyer):** General Counsel for the Movement Foundation, who
  initially deemed the draft contract "possibly the worst agreement I have ever seen"
  but ultimately signed a version of the deal.

  *   **Rushi Monshay & Cooper Scanlan:** Co-founders of Movement Labs, with Rushi
  implicated in circulating the initial deal internally.

  *   **Sam Tapoli:** Described as a "shadow co-founder" who linked Movement to investors
  and was CC''d on relevant communications.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The entire situation underscores the legal risks associated with opaque financial
  agreements in crypto. The structure involving separate Labs and Foundation entities
  is noted as a common tactic to avoid securities regulations. The explicit incentive
  structure within the contract raises serious concerns regarding **market manipulation
  laws**, even if the project operates outside traditional finance.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a growing trend where investigative journalism is having
  immediate, tangible effects on token viability (delistings, bans). It also highlights
  the need for greater transparency and clearer separation of duties within crypto
  organizations, especially when dealing with large token allocations and market support
  agreements, to prevent these types of contractual loopholes from being exploited.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto Professionals, Legal Counsel in Web3,
  Investment Analysts, and Journalists** covering the blockchain space, as it dissects
  a complex, high-stakes corporate governance and financial scandal.'
