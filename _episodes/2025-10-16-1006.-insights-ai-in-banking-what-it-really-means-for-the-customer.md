    in financial services, there's not much to see, at least not yet, or at least
    not that we've seen.
  topic: predictions/strategy
- impact_reason: 'This is a key technical/risk insight: the probabilistic nature of
    generative AI necessitates far more rigorous testing than traditional deterministic
    software before customer release.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's just when it comes to launching kind of AI customer experiences, given
    that they are kind of more probabilistic than they are deterministic, there's
    just a huge amount of testing that needs to go into place before they're launched
    into the hands of customers.
  topic: technical/safety
- impact_reason: A strong statement on the current limitations of AI safety and reliability
    when applied to high-stakes financial control (agentic systems).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We're not 100% ready yet or even close to 100% ready yet to let some of these
    things control our finances, which is I guess where the agentic component comes
    in.
  topic: safety
- impact_reason: 'Crucial UX/customer insight: users accept AI for efficiency (self-service)
    but reject it for autonomy (decision-making), highlighting a trust barrier.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Customers are actually at the moment preferring AI tools that allow them to
    self-serve. So, they're comfortable with automation. But when AI starts making
    decisions on their behalf, they feel like they're losing a bit of that control.
  topic: safety/business

    enabling price reductions (8x cheaper) and opening services to previously unaffordable
    customer segments.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Through working with us, they've actually made it possible. It's kind of ended
    up almost like an eighth of the price point of the original price point of their
    service offering or proposition, albeit through all of these kind of automation
    and kind of productivity enhancements and making that available and that is a
    total game-changer for some of these firms now and opening up the service of advice
    to what we hope will be millions more customers.
  topic: business/predictions
- impact_reason: 'Provides a strong technical argument for model specialization: using
    smaller, fine-tuned models for simple tasks (like date extraction) instead of
    costly frontier models.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Throwing that at a frontier model is just a waste. There's kind of there's
    kind of no point. So in fact, what we want to do there is have patterns where
    we can say, okay, this is good for a fine-tuned model and we can fine-tune and
    we can get really good at date extraction in fine-tuning, for example.

    ensuring the teams building the technology are deeply connected to the underlying
    business problems they are meant to solve.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: How do you avoid falling into a shiny object situation? ... It means that
    the people who are doing the work are aware of the business problems and they're
    focusing on that. Okay, and they understand the tech. They understand what it's
    for. But the tech is not the thing solving the problems, the thing, and they see
    that and they feel that.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: 'A critical reality check for tech builders: the difficulty of scaling
    and productionizing AI solutions (the last 90%) far outweighs the initial MVP
    build.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I know what my engineers and I'm sure Oscar will second this is building out
    an MVP is maybe 5-10% of really the challenge. Like to get into production is
    really quite difficult beyond that and takes a lot of rigor and everything else.
  topic: business/strategy
- impact_reason: A powerful case study on explainability in AI outputs. Users need
    actionable, decomposed insights ('what it means for them') over opaque, holistic
    scores.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: When we tested it with just the score itself, it didn't test very well. Customers
    didn't really understand what the score was showing them and why they were being
    showed this score. But when we broke the score down into components and we gave
    the most score out of 10 for each measure and they then tested better because
    customers want to understand not necessarily exactly how the AI is working, but
    what it means for them.
  topic: technical/business
- impact_reason: Articulates a core limitation of text-based interfaces (typing speed
    vs. thought speed) and makes a strong case for voice interfaces when systems can
    accurately capture meaning and intent.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The thing that frustrates me is that I can't type fast enough for my thoughts.
    . . actually talking just makes the thoughts come out easier. And if we can build
    technical systems that can respond to meaning and intent, then voice, I think,
    is a natural modality for this.
  topic: technical/predictions
- impact_reason: Posits that unstructured voice interaction is ideal for brainstorming
    and exploring vague ideas, but raises the crucial open question of whether AI
    can replicate the trust required for this level of interaction.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Voice makes sense because it's unstructured. I don't necessarily know actually
    what I'm talking about. I just have a few ideas and I want to bounce some ideas
    off of someone. So that works. And to what extent then will that then work when
    I'm speaking to an AI no matter how eloquent that AI actually is?
  topic: technical/predictions

    emotional resonance (tone) will be the differentiator between leading and average
    AI products.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: there is that familiarity, there is that tone of voice aspect to it that I

    of language models in traditionally non-computational, deeply human fields like
    therapy and coaching.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We're now seeing AI therapists, AI coaches. These are such fun. There's no
    number crunching in there, right? These are fundamentally human services that
    are out there that are beginning to find some type of form factor in the digital
    world with with elements because there is an element of this technology which
    can understand language.

    sensitive sectors like banking lags behind the technology''s capability, primarily
    due to an existing trust deficit.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think when it comes to banking and using your banking app, I think that
    customers aren't quite there. They see banks need, banks, financial institutions
    need to build trust with their customers. And I don't think that they quite have
    that yet.

    deployed in customer-facing finance roles.

    gains AI is already providing in the back office (compliance, operations).

    outputs.

  text: The areas where firms are looking to kind of launch AI and get it kind of
    helping customers might be a bit more in the background, you know, where there

    human-supervised pilots to fully autonomous customer-facing systems is a massive
    leap.'

    Talk about scaling that up into some customer-facing use case. It's a completely

  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: Pinpoints the exact misalignment between bank ambitions (automation/decision-making)
    and customer desire (control/assistance).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: They don't want the AI to take over completely and make the decisions for
    them. So, we're seeing a bit of this mismatch between their attitudes towards
    AI and the products and their services that banks and financial institutions are
    trying to offer.
  topic: business

    be gradual, educational, and focused on earning user trust rather than immediate,
    disruptive deployment.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We don't just want to be like landing you with a load of AI in front of you
    and you're like, what's this? And are you going to take decisions for me? No,
    we've got to take you on the journey. We really got to establish the trust.
  topic: business/strategy
- impact_reason: Highlights the critical gap between deep technical understanding
    and public perception/trust regarding AI, emphasizing the need for earned trust
    before deploying advanced features.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think that it's an important component for us in building the trust with
    the public, right? Because I think it's worth remembering the sort of my perspective
    is as someone who's deeply into this tech thinking about this all day. I love
    it. I love thinking about the tech but the public is not necessarily there with
    me.
  topic: safety/strategy
- impact_reason: Offers concrete, high-impact examples of 'invisible' backend automation
    (transcription, note-taking, CRM updates, document generation) transforming professional
    service efficiency.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Having the, you know, the conversation transcribed, having notes automatically
    taken, having all the kind of information that's been collected updated in those
    core CRMs. All the way through to having, you know, follow-up emails, documents,
    you know, key documents generated on the back of the meeting makes such a huge
    difference to the effectiveness of the advice service.
  topic: business/predictions
- impact_reason: 'Crucial technical insight: effective AI deployment requires a ''mix
    and match'' strategy using various specialized models, rejecting the idea of a
    single monolithic solution.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So it's it's multi-modal. There's all sorts of different foundation-like models
    that you're using in different techniques. It's not a one-size-fits-all by any
    means.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: Connects technical model selection (using smaller models) directly
    to business benefits (cost savings) and sustainability (reduced energy consumption).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Also, truthfully, it saves us a bit of money. And then the other question
    that we want to think about here is it's better for the environment. Right. Like
    if we're using a smaller, less capable model for a task where it's more appropriate,
    well, then we're going to be burning fewer tokens and we're going to be chewing
    up less watts in a data center.
  topic: technical/business/strategy
- impact_reason: Argues that cheap execution (due to AI tools) shifts organizational
    focus from 'what to do' to 'how to enable execution,' highlighting the need for
    organizational structure to support rapid value delivery.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What that means is that you really need that empowerment because you're no
    longer trying to figure out what to do to as great a degree, right? You're now
    figuring out okay, like I've got this thing and I can make it happen. Am I able
    to move it forward? Are there structures in the organization that given that I'm
    able to do this work are going to enable me to bring that value towards my customers?

    privacy) are amplified by AI, rather than entirely new risk classes emerging.
    This frames regulatory and security efforts.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's not necessarily the case that whole new categories of risk or issue are
    emerging. Rather, the things that we already knew about are being amped up.
  topic: safety
- impact_reason: Provides a concrete, high-impact example of AI amplifying existing
    cybersecurity threats (phishing), emphasizing volume and sophistication over novelty.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What we're seeing is that people are using AI to craft really great phishing
    emails and send more of them. So, these are problems that we already knew about
    but we just have more of them. It's not a new category, it's an old category and
    a higher volume.
  topic: safety/technical
- impact_reason: 'Strong advice for AI product development: use regulatory sandboxes
    or early market testing to learn and iterate before attempting mass scaling.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think it's a really powerful way of putting your proposition into market
    and really, I think the key thing there is learning about it. Learning what's
    working, what's not working, what you perhaps need to build on top of it to make
    it work before you then go into scaling it.
  topic: business/strategy
- impact_reason: 'Identifies the deep psychological aspect of finance, suggesting
    a major future application for AI: self-understanding and behavioral change, moving
    beyond simple transactions.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think money is intensely psychological, right? In terms of how you conceptualize
    it, what it is to you. And so it seems to me that there's plenty of scope in the
    future to be thinking about using this kind of AI to help you understand your
    own relationship with money.
  topic: predictions/business
- impact_reason: Provides a specific anecdote illustrating that attempts to strip
    human characteristics (like gendered voice) from AI can backfire, suggesting familiarity
    trumps perceived neutrality in some contexts.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think it might have been Google who tried to make an AI seem not human-like.
    They tried to give it a non-gendered voice and customers felt very uneasy by this,
    and they actually preferred it to sound like a man or a woman because that's what's
    natural and familiar to us.
  topic: safety/strategy

    to share sensitive information (trust), a key consideration for financial AI.
  relevance_score: 9

summary: '## Podcast Summary: 1006. Insights: AI in banking: What it really means
  for the customer


  This 48-minute episode of *Fintech Insider Insights* cuts through the generative
  AI hype to examine the tangible, customer-facing applications of Artificial Intelligence
  currently being deployed, or held back, within the financial services industry.
  The core narrative explores the significant disconnect between the perceived potential
  of AI (especially GenAI) and the slow, cautious rollout of genuinely transformative
  customer experiences in banking.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **practical application and customer perception of
  AI in banking**, contrasting existing, often invisible, backend automation with
  the slow emergence of front-end, agentic customer experiences. Key themes include
  customer trust, the role of UX research in adoption, the technical realities of
  deployment (fine-tuning vs. foundational models), and the strategic importance of
  internal organizational culture in driving successful AI integration.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Model Mixing and Efficiency:** Successful deployment involves a multi-modal
  approach, strategically mixing foundational models with smaller, fine-tuned models
  for specific tasks (e.g., date extraction). This approach saves costs, reduces environmental
  impact (fewer tokens/watts), and optimizes performance based on task complexity.

  *   **Backend Automation Revolutionizing Advice:** AI is significantly impacting
  the quality and speed of financial advice by automating administrative tasks for
  advisors, such as real-time transcription, automated note-taking, CRM updates, and
  rapid document generation, drastically reducing fulfillment time from weeks to hours/days.

  *   **The MVP Trap:** While building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) with new AI
  tools is quick (5-10% of the challenge), the rigor required to move these solutions
  into secure, production-ready customer environments remains the primary technical
  and operational hurdle.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Advice Accessibility as a Game Changer:** Automation driven by AI is enabling
  firms to offer sophisticated advice services at significantly lower price points
  (in one example, reduced to one-eighth of the original cost), opening up previously
  underserved customer segments to professional advice.

  *   **Trust as the Primary Barrier to Agentic AI:** The biggest hurdle for customer-facing
  AI is not technological capability but earning public trust. Financial institutions
  must adopt a step-by-step approach, ensuring humans remain in the loop initially,
  to onboard customers to semi-autonomous behaviors.

  *   **Empowerment Over Execution:** As AI makes execution cheap and easy, organizational
  success hinges on structures that empower internal teams (close to tech, data, and
  business problems) to move validated ideas from prototype to production smoothly,
  avoiding "shiny object syndrome."


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Starling Bank (Oscar Barlow):** Highlighted for its internal culture of empowering
  tech teams and its practical application of AI via the **Spend Intelligence Tool**,
  which incorporates generative elements while focusing on building customer trust
  step-by-step.

  *   **Multiply AI (Vivek Medlani):** Focuses on helping firms launch scaled advice
  propositions, leveraging new AI developments to enhance advisor productivity and
  accessibility.

  *   **Bunk (Netherlands):** Cited as a positive example of a chatbot that feels
  human-like and maintains customer control through **reactive/revolving prompts**
  based on recent activity and actively soliciting customer feedback to shape the
  AI.

  *   **11FS (Rosie Lee):** Provided the crucial UX perspective, emphasizing that
  customers prefer AI tools for **self-service** but resist AI making decisions on
  their behalf, demanding control over the process.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is moving toward a hybrid model where AI
  handles high-volume, low-risk tasks in the background (KYC, process automation),
  while front-end customer experiences will evolve slowly, prioritizing **control
  and transparency**. The future success of advice propositions lies in leveraging
  AI to drastically reduce costs, democratizing access to personalized financial guidance.
  The persistence of off-channel AI use (e.g., customers using ChatGPT for financial
  queries) indicates a strong latent demand that regulated institutions must eventually
  meet responsibly.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Fintech Professionals, Banking Executives,
  Product Managers, AI/ML Strategy Leads, and UX/Customer Experience Strategists**
  operating within regulated financial services who need to move beyond the hype and
  understand the practical, trust-based roadmap for AI adoption.'
