  topic: technology/investment
- impact_reason: This quote perfectly encapsulates the micro-negotiations and trade-offs
    (like including or excluding key institutional investors like Fidelity) that determine
    the final IPO price, challenging the narrative that massive upside was 'left on
    the table' by ignoring hypothetical high bids.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The people who said, "Oh, three billion dollars on the table," the $98 price
    only happened because the IPO happened at $38. It's exactly what you said, Harry.
    The discussion they were having on the day was, let's call it the halogen discussion
    of, "Do I go two bucks more and exclude Fidelity, or two bucks less and take Fidelity?"
  topic: Investment/Business Strategy
- impact_reason: 'A crucial insight into IPO pricing mechanics: the initial price
    must be low enough to build a solid order book. Hypothetical high bids that don''t
    materialize at the initial pricing level are irrelevant; accessibility of capital
    at the set price is key.'

  text: And had someone walk in and said, "I know this IPO is going to price at $100
    a share to open tomorrow morning. Let's raise at $80." They wouldn't have had

  topic: Investment/Business Strategy
- impact_reason: Exposes the inherent conflict of interest between investment banks
    (who profit from hedge fund placements) and founders (who prefer stable, long-only
    investors) during allocation.

  text: And all of a sudden, like, "Oh, actually, we're across the table from you."
    And the first thing you're across the table from is they give you the book of
    all the people who want to buy your stock... Morgan Stanley wants that too. They
    want to keep them happy, but they also want their hedge fund buddies in there
    because they make a lot of money in there. So that's a negotiation trying to get
    all that, switch the hedge funds down and get the long-only up.
  topic: Investment/Business Strategy

  text: We wanted to go out to $25. Morgan Stanley said we should wear a $24. And
    the reason we're going to $24 is Fidelity has told us that they're in at $24.
    They're out at $25. And you really want Fidelity because Fidelity is just trillions
    of dollars and they could home, you know, they could be a massive anchor.
  topic: Investment

  text: You want Fidelity, you want T. Rowe, you want Wellington, you want Capital.
    There's like six big long-only funds you want in there. And they're pissed because
    they're not getting a big allocation. And so that created the demand environment
    that was a little tricky for them because they wanted to buy more shares. And
    that's what pushes the price way up.

    $35, $38, whatever it was. There was some at $38. There was some at $39. There
    was some at $40. No one was putting in an order at $98. So what happened? And
    this is kind of a bit existential, metaphysical, maybe go with it. The $98 price
    only happened because the IPO happened at $38.
  topic: Investment

    often have short-term internal price targets, suggesting that even a 'designed'
    pop might trigger selling pressure sooner than founders hope.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you have a 20% pop and you get in Fidelity at $25, they'll buy more at
    $32. Let me give you a really sad fact. And I didn't realize this at first. All
    those big buyers who came in at Figma at $38 before they buy, they have an internal
    process with a price target to exit. None of those price targets are going to
    be more than $110 a share.
  topic: Investment
- impact_reason: 'A critical insight into institutional investor behavior: long-term
    investors often have pre-set, conservative price targets, meaning massive immediate
    pops often trigger selling from the very investors founders hope will anchor the
    stock.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: None of those price targets are going to be more than $110 a share. So unfortunately,
    because you want to price it, because it's now trading at a price that's probably
    above the long-term price target of the long-term investors you want, most of
    them are selling those shares right now.

summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Figma''s Pop, Tech Earnings, and VC Shifts


  This 80-minute episode of 20VC, featuring Harry Stebbings and guests Jason Lampkin,
  Rory Driscoll, and special guest Brian Halligan (Founder of HubSpot), provided a
  deep dive into recent market events, focusing heavily on the mechanics and implications
  of high-profile IPOs, recent tech earnings, and shifts within the venture capital
  landscape.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus areas were **General Tech/Venture Capital**, specifically analyzing
  the mechanics of IPO pricing (using Figma as the prime example), dissecting blowout
  earnings from major tech players (Meta and Microsoft), and discussing significant
  recent private market valuations (Cognition and Ramp). A secondary but crucial theme
  was the internal dynamics and pressures faced by founders during the IPO process.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **IPO Pricing as a Negotiation of Access, Not Just Valuation:** The discussion
  highlighted that the final IPO price is often a micro-negotiation between founders,
  bankers, and anchor investors (like Fidelity). The goal is often to secure *desired
  long-only investors* at a slightly lower price point to ensure long-term stability,
  even if it leaves "money on the table" in the short term.

  *   **The "Controlled Pop" vs. Euphoria:** A standard, desired IPO pop (e.g., 15-20%)
  is engineered to make initial investors feel good and encourage holding. The massive
  250% pop seen by Figma is considered an anomaly or an "earthquake"—a natural phenomenon
  resulting from extreme supply/demand imbalance and market euphoria, which may not
  be solvable by alternative structures like Direct Listings.

  *   **Direct Listing Limitations:** While direct listings allow companies to raise
  capital, the analysis suggested they might not prevent massive initial pops if the
  underlying asset quality and market sentiment are exceptionally high, as the initial
  price discovery mechanism remains susceptible to retail/speculative rushes.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Figma Mispricing Debate:** The consensus was that the massive pop was *not*
  due to a fundamental, accessible mispricing (i.e., no one was willing to place large
  orders at $98 pre-market). Instead, the high price was driven by low supply, high
  demand from retail/speculative buyers, and the subsequent euphoria once the stock
  began trading.

  *   **Long-Only Investor Behavior:** A sobering insight was that even "long-only"
  institutional investors often have internal price targets. If a stock doubles or
  triples immediately, many are forced to sell significant portions to lock in gains,
  meaning the desired long-term stability might be undermined by extreme initial pops.

  *   **VC Downsizing Context:** The mention of CRV downsizing suggests a broader
  market correction where VCs are adjusting fund sizes and expectations, impacting
  future LP/GP relationships and potentially leading to more conservative deployment
  strategies.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Figma:** The central case study regarding the extreme IPO pop (pricing around
  $33, hitting ~$145).

  *   **HubSpot (Brian Halligan):** Provided firsthand experience of the IPO pricing
  night, detailing the pressure to choose between hedge funds and long-only investors,
  and the internal conflict with bankers over pricing points (e.g., Fidelity''s $24
  vs. $25 target).

  *   **Meta & Microsoft:** Mentioned for their blowout earnings, signaling strong
  performance in the core enterprise and advertising tech sectors.

  *   **Cognition & Ramp:** Noted for recent high-value private raises ($15BN and
  $22BN, respectively), indicating continued high-stakes funding in AI infrastructure
  and fintech.

  *   **Zendesk:** Used as a comparative example to HubSpot, illustrating how timing
  and securing a strong initial institutional investor base (long-onlys) can significantly
  impact a company''s trajectory post-IPO, especially when facing activist pressure
  later on.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched upon the **SEC amending rules to allow capital raising in
  direct listings**, making that structure more viable, though the practical impact
  on preventing massive pops was debated.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a market where **timing and investor selection are paramount**
  for successful public debuts. While the IPO process remains fraught with last-minute
  conflict and potential for massive mispricing, the underlying strength of top-tier
  assets (like Figma) will continue to attract speculative fervor. The industry is
  likely heading toward a period where founders must be acutely aware of the behavioral
  economics driving IPO pricing, recognizing that a "perfect" outcome is elusive.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Venture Capital professionals (GPs/LPs), Investment
  Bankers, Founders preparing for an IPO, and Senior Tech Executives** interested
  in market mechanics and strategic financing decisions.'
