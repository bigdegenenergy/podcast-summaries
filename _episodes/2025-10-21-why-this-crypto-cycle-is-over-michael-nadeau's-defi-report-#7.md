summary: '## Podcast Summary: Why This Crypto Cycle is Over | Michael Nadeau''s DeFi
  Report #7


  This 79-minute episode features Michael Nadeau of the DeFi Report discussing his
  conviction that the current crypto bull cycle is effectively over, leading him to
  adopt a highly risk-off stance. The conversation centers on analyzing on-chain data
  and historical cycle patterns to justify this significant shift in portfolio allocation.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area:**

  The primary focus is **Crypto Market Cycles and DeFi Investment Strategy**, specifically
  analyzing whether the current market phase represents the end of the bull run or
  a temporary dip before a melt-up. The discussion heavily relies on on-chain fundamentals,
  leverage metrics, and historical cycle symmetry.


  **2. Key Technical Insights:**

  *   **Extreme Leverage Unwinding:** ETH futures estimated leverage ratios reached
  near all-time highs (approaching 1:1 collateral to leverage), indicating the market
  was "over its skis" and highly susceptible to the massive liquidations observed
  during the recent flash crash.

  *   **Cycle Phase Identification:** Nadeau frames the cycle in four stages: Early
  Bull, Wealth Creation, Wealth Distribution, and Wealth Destruction. He argues the
  market has largely completed the **Wealth Creation** phase (Oct ''23 - Jan ''25,
  marked by ETF inflows) and is now deep into a prolonged **Wealth Distribution**
  phase, where early long-term holders are selling into high prices ($100K+ for BTC).

  *   **Diminishing Catalysts:** The primary buying catalyst (spot Bitcoin ETFs) has
  largely been absorbed, leading to a lack of clear fundamental drivers to push prices
  significantly higher from current levels to projected targets ($150K BTC).


  **3. Market/Investment Angle:**

  *   **Shift to Risk-Off:** Nadeau has moved his portfolio from 75-80% deployed to
  approximately **70% cash**, marking the first time he has been this risk-off since
  2022.

  *   **Late Cycle Confirmation:** The current market duration (over 1,065 days since
  the Nov 2022 trough) aligns closely with the length of previous cycles, suggesting
  the market is structurally late, despite the lack of a clear "blow-off top."

  *   **Contrarian Timing:** Nadeau executed the significant shift to risk-off *before*
  the major flash crash in mid-October, based on weakening underlying fundamentals
  (low volume, slowing ETF flows) despite high leverage.


  **4. Notable Companies/People:**

  *   **Michael Nadeau (DeFi Report):** The central figure, known for a disciplined,
  fundamental, Buffett-esque approach to crypto cycles, focusing on deploying capital
  during fear and exiting into greed.

  *   **Bit Digital:** Mentioned as a sponsor and an example of an institutional player
  that has pivoted its treasury entirely into staked Ethereum (ETH).

  *   **BlackRock/Fidelity:** Referenced as the price-agnostic ETF buyers whose initial
  massive inflows provided confidence for leveraged traders to pile into the market.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  While not a primary focus, the discussion touches on the impact of **ETF flows**
  as a major structural change this cycle, effectively acting as a massive, consistent
  buyer that influenced trader behavior and leverage accumulation. Geopolitics and
  tariffs were mentioned as external macro risks being monitored.


  **6. Future Implications:**

  Nadeau suggests the industry may be entering a **Wealth Destruction** phase, which
  typically follows prolonged distribution. If the market fails to hold key structural
  levels (like the 50-day moving average around $102K for BTC), a significant breakdown
  is likely. The cycle, if over, will have played out differently due to the ETF structure,
  potentially setting a higher base for the *next* bear market.


  **7. Target Audience:**

  **Crypto Portfolio Managers, Institutional Investors, and Sophisticated DeFi/On-Chain
  Analysts** who utilize cycle analysis and fundamental data to time market entry
  and exit points. It is less relevant for passive DCA investors.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  Michael Nadeau joins the podcast to present his strong conviction that the current
  crypto bull cycle is concluding, prompting his first major risk-off move since 2022,
  increasing his cash position to 70%. Nadeau’s investment philosophy emphasizes disciplined
  cycle trading: being greedy when others are fearful by accumulating assets during
  bear markets and rotating into cash during late-cycle euphoria.


  The core of his bearish thesis rests on **on-chain cycle analysis and market structure
  weakness**. He notes that the current expansion phase is historically long. He identifies
  the period following the ETF launch (Q4 2023 into Q1 2024) as the "Wealth Creation"
  phase, where the majority of new money and speculative activity occurred, culminating
  in early holders selling into prices near $100K Bitcoin. Since then, the market
  has been in a prolonged "Wealth Distribution" phase, characterized by long-term
  holders de-risking.


  Nadeau’s decision to shift aggressively to risk-off was made *before* the recent
  flash crash, based on observing a dangerous divergence: **extremely high leverage
  (especially in ETH)** coupled with **weakening underlying fundamentals** (slowing
  ETF flows, low spot volume). This lopsided structure suggested the market was vulnerable
  to a sudden unwind, which materialized.


  He challenges the notion of an imminent melt-up, questioning who the marginal buyer
  is now that the initial ETF demand surge has subsided. While acknowledging that
  the absolute bull market structure for Bitcoin hasn''t been definitively broken,
  the probability favors weakness, leading him to exit ahead of potential "Wealth
  Destruction." The conversation serves as a critical warning for investors still
  fully deployed, emphasizing the need to'
