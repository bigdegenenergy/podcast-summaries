    instead of needing to go find the people to replace, you're replacing those with
    robotics and AI agents and productivity, the margins should continue to improve.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: #1556 Jordi Visser | Are Bitcoin Bonds the Next Big
  Investment?


  This episode of the Pom Podcast features Anthony Pompliano in conversation with
  Jordy Visser, a veteran of Wall Street with 30 years of experience, to discuss major
  weekly developments impacting portfolios, focusing heavily on the intersection of
  traditional finance (TradFi) and Bitcoin/crypto innovation.


  The main narrative arc centered on the emerging financial structures bridging the
  fiat and digital economies, specifically **Bitcoin Bonds ("Bit Bonds")** and **asset
  tokenization**, alongside a discussion on recent US political and trade policy shifts.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion primarily focused on **Crypto/Web3 Finance and Investment Structures**,
  specifically:

  *   The practical implementation and implications of **Bitcoin-backed bonds (Bit
  Bonds)** for governments and municipalities.

  *   The future of **asset tokenization** (real estate, private equity) and its impact
  on market liquidity and accessibility.

  *   Macroeconomic policy debates concerning **tariffs, trade wars, and capital controls**.

  *   The role of corporate treasuries (like MicroStrategy) in pioneering new capital-raising
  instruments.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bit Bond Construction:** A Bit Bond structure can be synthesized by combining
  a low-coupon, principal-protected zero-coupon bond (often backed by US Treasuries)
  with the excess coupon yield being used to purchase **call options on Bitcoin**.
  This separates the principal guarantee from the upside potential tied to BTC performance.

  *   **Tokenization as Liquidity Enhancement:** Tokenization is viewed as a mechanism
  to dramatically increase the demand pool for traditionally illiquid assets (like
  private equity or real estate) by fractionalizing ownership and enabling retail
  participation, mirroring historical market structures like "perks" during the internet
  boom.

  *   **Bitcoin as a Hurdle Rate:** Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed not just
  as an asset, but as the **"hurdle rate for innovation"**—the benchmark return that
  new capital structures must offer to attract investment away from the traditional
  system.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Demand Migration:** Capital markets are naturally migrating toward areas of
  high demand; currently, any crypto-related fundraising is oversubscribed, indicating
  strong investor appetite for Bitcoin exposure with principal protection.

  *   **Institutional Adoption Proof:** Michael Saylor''s success with MicroStrategy''s
  convertible notes has proven the viability of these hybrid instruments, paving the
  way for governments (like NYC) to adopt Bit Bonds to tap into this demand while
  funding budget shortfalls at potentially lower effective interest rates.

  *   **Banks Will Follow:** Given the proven demand and profitability potential,
  it is inevitable that major financial institutions will develop and sell various
  forms of Bitcoin-debt structures.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordy Visser:** The guest, providing a TradFi perspective on the merging of
  capital structures.

  *   **Anthony Pompliano (Pom):** Host, emphasizing transparency (via Bitwise''s
  public wallets) and the need for Bitcoin open-source development funding.

  *   **Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy):** Highlighted as the pioneer who demonstrated
  the demand for Bitcoin-linked corporate debt instruments, effectively opening the
  door for municipal adoption.

  *   **Sandy (Franklin Templeton/formerly City):** Mentioned for her early, compelling
  vision of asset tokenization dating back to 2019.

  *   **Bitwise:** Mentioned as the first Bitcoin ETF provider to publish wallet addresses
  and donate 10% of ETF profits to open-source developers.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Tariff Uncertainty:** Recent conflicting court rulings regarding the legality
  of presidential tariffs have created volatility, suggesting the issue will likely
  be settled by the Supreme Court.

  *   **Capital Controls as the Next Frontier:** Visser argues that if trade tariffs
  are legally restricted, the administration may pivot toward **capital controls**
  as an alternative mechanism to manage trade imbalances and capital flows, especially
  concerning foreign investment in the US.

  *   **Government Spending Shift:** The recent debt ceiling bill is interpreted as
  signaling a shift away from cost-cutting mandates toward a focus on **economic growth**,
  potentially increasing the deficit regardless of political rhetoric, similar to
  how Elon Musk refocused on productivity after encountering government bureaucracy
  at Twitter.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where the fiat and Bitcoin economies are deeply
  intertwined through standardized financial products. Bit Bonds will likely become
  commonplace for corporate and sovereign debt issuance globally. Furthermore, tokenization
  is seen as a necessary decentralizing force that will democratize access to securities
  currently reserved for institutions and the wealthy.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Finance Professionals, Institutional Investors,
  and Crypto Strategists** who need to understand the practical application of digital
  assets within traditional capital markets and macro policy shifts.'
