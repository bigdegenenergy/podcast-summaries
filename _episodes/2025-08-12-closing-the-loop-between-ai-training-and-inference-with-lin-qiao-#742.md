  text: 'We thoughtâ€”I thoughtâ€”these two loops, as I just talked about: the ideation,
    fast ideation, experimentation loop, and the production loop, can be completely
    decoupled. [...] However, this conversion is taking forever because these two
    systems are not designed to be compatible with each other.'

    inference environments to enable instant scaling upon validation.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And the second is the inference system for experimentation needs to be the
    same as the inference system for large production. Because once you find product-market
    fit, the immediate thing the product team is going to do is, 'I did I route one
    percent of my traffic for doing A-B testing. It looks good. I want to ramp up,
    ramp it up quickly to 10%, 20%, 50%, 100%.' No time. I cannot wait.

    and AI evaluation (defining expectations/rewards), emphasizing that defining the
    goal must precede automated learning.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The challenge today is, first, in order for us to have that, people need to
    write what is the expectation for the model to grow into that expectation. Okay?
    It's like when if we want to test our code, we need to first write unit tests,
    right? And unit tests are basically, "I expect this piece of code to behave this
    way," right?

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: In this new wave of GenAI, the product development philosophy is also changing.
    As in many people, we are seeing there being building a great product with huge
    adoption over a small amount of time is they do not think of the model as a commodity
    or as just a utility you plug in as is. They think about the model as a critical
    part, a critical asset of their product.

    the gap between public training data and proprietary application data leads to
    performance degradation.'

    data silo is the next frontier for competitive advantage, requiring new tooling
    to access.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We firmly believe there is a huge void in that space to standardize and to
    bring more tools and a platform to close the loop, to close the loop because we
    believe a large portion of data is actually not on the internet. A large portion
    of data lives with the application itself.

    (verticalized data) is the true, non-sharable competitive asset, differentiating
    players beyond foundational model access.'

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: if all the labs essentially have access to the same amount of data, then the
    only difference is in the app space, they cannot have access to those application-specific

    the asset, that is the unique competitive edge, and no one will share outside.

  text: it's on the one hand, earlier, you expressed excitement about all this cool
    stuff coming out, but then you also articulated a bit that the underlying model

    that it becomes this asset.

    two phases, if not more. In the most simplistic way, the first bulk of developer

    lots of control, and validate your hypothesisâ€”what can work with me, what won't
    workâ€”and fail fast.

    to worry about latency to bring these interactive experiences of consumer-facing,

    from, options we need to pick and choose from, have a lot of components. Each

    to more than 100,000 different combinations. And then it becomes a search problem.

    by the system bottleneck, right? Some part of model execution is fully bottlenecked

summary: '## Comprehensive Summary: Closing the Loop Between AI Training and Inference
  with Lin Qiao - #742


  This podcast episode features Sam Charrington in conversation with **Lin Qiao**,
  CEO and co-founder of **Fireworks AI**, focusing on the critical need to unify the
  AI development lifecycle, particularly bridging the gap between model experimentation
  (training/tuning) and production deployment (inference). Lin draws heavily on his
  experience leading the PyTorch team at Meta to illustrate the inefficiencies caused
  by decoupling these two phases.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Enterprise Generative AI Infrastructure**, specifically
  addressing the **end-to-end developer platform** required for seamless iteration
  across the entire AI lifecycleâ€”from initial experimentation and fine-tuning to high-scale,
  cost-efficient production inference. A major theme is the necessity of **closing
  the loop** between training outcomes and real-world product performance via fast
  inference-based A/B testing.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Decoupling Failure:** The historical approach of completely separating training
  systems from production inference systems creates massive friction, primarily due
  to the time and precision loss incurred during model conversion (e.g., moving from
  research formats to optimized production formats).

  *   **Inference as the Foundation:** Inference is positioned as the foundational
  layer for modern GenAI workflows, even for post-training activities like Reinforcement
  Fine-Tuning (RFT), which inherently requires fast inference for rollouts and evaluation.

  *   **3D Optimization for Inference:** Fireworks AI focuses on a "3D optimizer"
  for inference, simultaneously optimizing across **Quality, Latency, and Cost**.
  This involves navigating a massive search space (over 100,000 combinations) of backend
  configurations, including disaggregated inference scaling, quantization techniques,
  and kernel selection based on context length and hardware.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Product Validation is Paramount:** Model investment is only meaningful if
  it "moves the needle for the product." Product A/B testing is identified as the
  ultimate judge of success, necessitating that the initial experimentation loop integrates
  fast inference.

  *   **Seamless Scaling is Essential:** Companies must avoid migration overhead.
  A platform that supports fast, low-fidelity experimentation *and* smooth, cost-optimized
  transition to high-volume production is crucial for surviving the transition from
  idea to viable business.

  *   **Virtuous Cycle of Customization:** Leaders in GenAI are mastering a cycle
  where initial powerful models are specialized using production data to create custom
  models that drive better user engagement, leading to more proprietary data for further
  refinement.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Lin Qiao (Fireworks AI):** Former head of PyTorch at Meta, whose experience
  highlighted the friction between research and production systems.

  *   **Fireworks AI:** A generalized platform aiming to abstract away infrastructure
  complexity for both experimentation and production inference, focusing on open models.

  *   **Meta/Google:** Mentioned as previous employers where Lin gained experience
  in building large-scale AI infrastructure (including PyTorch development).

  *   **OpenAI:** Their API standard is adopted as the initial abstraction layer for
  developers in the pre-product-market-fit stage.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a **unified, end-to-end developer platform** where
  the transition between development stages is frictionless. There is a strong push
  toward **standardization in application-specific tuning**, particularly around Reinforcement
  Fine-Tuning (RFT) evaluation, which Lin suggests will require open-sourcing tools
  to address the messy integration points for application-specific reward signals.
  The long-term vision points toward models constantly refining themselves based on
  real-time user feedback (online training/refinement).


  ### 6. Target Audience

  **AI/ML Engineers, Infrastructure Architects, CTOs, and Product Leaders** involved
  in deploying and scaling Generative AI applications. Professionals focused on MLOps,
  model optimization, and platform strategy will find the technical deep dive into
  inference optimization and the lifecycle management lessons highly valuable.'
