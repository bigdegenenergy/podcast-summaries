    due to regulatory clarity.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Instead of looking at chains and ecosystems, we need to shift our focus to
    launch pads. That's simply because the SEC has declared that most meme coins are
    not securities. So, this means that it's possible for launch pads to start doing
    things like meme coin pre-sales without violating any securities laws.

    as the primary differentiator for launch pad success, moving beyond mere technical
    execution.

    that launch pad has to other key players in the crypto industry, particularly
    to other key players associated with the launch pad or the blockchain it's on.

    meme coins becoming big after dog meme coins kind of makes sense in a weird way.

    meme coin seasons by using the historical precedent of repeated crypto market
    cycles.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Proponents of this idea claim that because investors lost money during the
    previous meme coin season, the chances of another meme coin season happening are
    slim. If that were true though, then the crypto market wouldn't have repeated
    cycles.
  topic: Adoption/Investment
- impact_reason: Uses historical cycle growth to debunk the 'saturation' theory, pointing
    to the continuous influx of new capital/investors as the driver for future cycles.

    than the 2017 cycle. This reveals the underlying idea behind the assumption that
    there will never be another meme coin season, and that's that all of the investors
    who could buy have already bought; there are no new investors coming.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: How to Find the Next 100x Memecoin in 2025:
  Full Tutorial


  This 20-minute podcast episode, hosted by Guy from Coin Bureau, provides an updated,
  comprehensive tutorial on identifying potential 100x meme coins, arguing that the
  market dynamics have fundamentally shifted since the previous meme coin season.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The episode focuses exclusively on **Cryptocurrency/Web3**, specifically analyzing
  the **meme coin market structure, investment strategies, and identifying emerging
  narratives** within the Solana, Sui, and Toncoin ecosystems.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Shift from Ecosystem to Launch Pad Focus:** The primary method for finding
  high-potential meme coins has shifted from tracking booming ecosystems (like Solana
  in 2024) to identifying high-quality **launch pads**. This is driven by the SEC''s
  stance that most meme coins are not securities, enabling launch pads to facilitate
  pre-sales with fewer regulatory hurdles.

  *   **Blockchain Selection Criteria:** The most viable blockchains for high-speed,
  low-latency meme coin launches are limited to those offering speed and low fees,
  specifically **Solana, Sui, and Toncoin** (due to Telegram integration). Layer 2s
  like Base are also noted due to easy access via established wallets (e.g., Phantom).

  *   **Wallet Superiority over Exchanges for Early Access:** User-friendly wallets
  like Phantom have surpassed centralized exchanges (CEXs) in accessibility for rapid
  token swaps, meaning CEX listings are less critical for early price discovery and
  initial massive pumps.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Regulatory Tailwind:** The SEC''s declaration that most meme coins are *not*
  securities significantly lowers regulatory risk for new launches, suggesting the
  next wave could be "even more insane" than the last.

  *   **Launch Pad Due Diligence:** The key to finding the next moonshots lies in
  vetting launch pads based on their **connections to key industry players** (founders,
  other successful launch pads, or blockchain developers).

  *   **Older vs. Newer Coins:** While new coins offer immediate vertical pumps, older,
  "sleeping" meme coins that have survived the initial crash phase and align with
  emerging narratives (e.g., cats, food) offer a potentially safer entry point for
  50x–100x gains by entering during the flatline phase.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Guy (Host):** From Coin Bureau, providing the analysis and tutorial.

  *   **SEC Officials/Chair:** Mentioned for their critical declaration classifying
  most meme coins as non-securities.

  *   **Pump.Fun:** Mentioned as the largest, yet controversial, meme coin launch
  pad.

  *   **Axium:** Highlighted as a necessary trading terminal on Solana for tracking
  launches across various popular launch pads.

  *   **Phantom Wallet:** Cited as a key driver of Solana''s success due to its superior
  user experience, even flipping Coinbase in app store rankings during peak hype.

  *   **Belive App & Moonshot:** Used as examples of launch pads potentially gaining
  traction due to founder connections within the ecosystem.

  *   **Maple Finance''s Syrup Token:** Mentioned as an example of the emerging "food"
  narrative in crypto, potentially spilling into meme coins.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The central regulatory discussion revolves around the **SEC''s non-security classification**
  for most meme coins. This effectively removes the threat of immediate regulatory
  intervention on new launches, allowing the market to operate with fewer upfront
  restrictions, though post-facto investigations into nefarious activity remain possible.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the meme coin market is maturing, moving from simple chain-based
  hype to a more sophisticated structure reliant on **launch pad infrastructure and
  narrative alignment**. The industry is heading toward cycles where retail participation
  will continue to grow, fueling subsequent meme coin seasons, challenging the notion
  that "all retail is already here."


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This content is highly valuable for **Crypto/Web3 Investors and Traders**, particularly
  those focused on high-risk, high-reward strategies within the speculative asset
  class of meme coins. It is aimed at professionals seeking actionable, updated methodologies
  beyond basic chain tracking.


  ---


  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast episode serves as an urgent update for investors aiming to capitalize
  on the anticipated next meme coin wave in 2025, detailing how the rules of engagement
  have changed since early 2024.


  The **main narrative arc** begins by establishing the regulatory shift: the SEC’s
  declaration that most meme coins are not securities has removed a major overhang,
  paving the way for potentially more intense speculative activity. This regulatory
  clarity fundamentally alters the investment focus. Previously, success hinged on
  identifying the hot blockchain ecosystem; now, the focus must shift to **launch
  pads**, as these platforms can now legally facilitate pre-sales and early access.


  Guy emphasizes the need for new tools, specifically recommending **Axium** as a
  trading terminal to monitor launches across various launch pads, moving beyond the
  reputationally tarnished Pump.Fun. The technical discussion confirms that **Solana
  remains dominant** due to its speed and low latency, supported by superior wallet
  UX (like Phantom), but **Sui and Toncoin** are identified as the next viable ecosystems
  to watch.


  A significant portion of the tutorial contrasts strategies for **new vs. established
  meme coins**. While new coins require intense, immediate action right at launch
  for potential 100x gains, older, "sleeping" coins offer a potentially more manageable
  path. The key to unlocking value in older coins is identifying **emerging narratives**—specifically
  cats and food themes—that could revitalize dormant communities. These older, smaller-cap'
