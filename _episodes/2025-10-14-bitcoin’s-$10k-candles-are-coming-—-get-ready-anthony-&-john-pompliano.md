  topic: adoption/technology
- impact_reason: 'Clarifies the dual nature of Bitcoin during crises: it''s a long-term

    asset. People go to it, but in moments of crisis, like not, or we're in a three-month
    crisis, right? Because that's when Bitcoin actually does pretty well. But in the
    reaction to news, Bitcoin is a very, very liquid market. And because Bitcoin is
    a very liquid market, people panic. News breaks, sell. What do you sell? What's
    liquid? What's open? Bitcoin's the only thing available to sell.

  text: I think with prediction markets, it actually gets farther out on that curve,

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Bitcoin’s $10K Candles Are Coming — Get Ready


  This 50-minute episode of the Pom Podcast, featuring Anthony Pompliano and John
  Pompliano, centered on analyzing recent market volatility, debunking crash narratives,
  and framing the current state of Bitcoin and the broader stock market within the
  context of persistent central bank intervention.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus was **Cryptocurrency (specifically Bitcoin)** and **Macroeconomics/Stock
  Market Analysis**, with a strong emphasis on how geopolitical events and Federal
  Reserve policy influence asset prices and investor behavior.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin Liquidity Event:** The recent $19 billion liquidation event, which
  saw Bitcoin drop significantly in a short period, effectively "wiped out all the
  excess leverage" from the market, suggesting a healthier foundation for future upward
  movement.

  *   **24/7 Market Advantage:** Geopolitical events occurring outside traditional
  stock market hours (like the Friday-to-Sunday window discussed) highlight Bitcoin''s
  24/7 trading availability, driving more users to crypto as they seek markets that
  can react instantly to global news.

  *   **Dollar vs. Percentage Moves:** The vernacular around Bitcoin is shifting from
  focusing on dollar movements (e.g., "$2,000 up") to percentage moves, even though
  the aggregate dollar value of daily moves is increasing significantly as the asset
  matures.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Pessimists are Wrong:** The hosts argue that the persistent calls for a market
  bubble or crash are unfounded, noting that respected figures like Howard Marks are
  now expressing bullishness, and the current bull market is only three years into
  an average 7-8 year cycle.

  *   **Fed Put/No Prolonged Bear Markets:** The core investment thesis is that the
  Federal Reserve will not allow any bear market or recession to last longer than
  12-18 months due to their playbook of deploying massive monetary stimulus (QE) to
  protect asset prices.

  *   **Efficiency Premium:** Companies like Palantir demonstrating high growth while
  simultaneously reducing headcount signals a new era of efficiency, justifying higher
  valuation multiples because they are delivering future profits faster with less
  overhead.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump:** Mentioned for his use of social media to influence market
  sentiment and negotiate geopolitically, demonstrating the power of the presidency
  to manipulate market openings.

  *   **Howard Marks (Oaktree):** Cited as a respected value investor whose current
  relative lack of concern signals a lack of true bubble conditions.

  *   **Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan):** Noted as another major financial figure acknowledging
  the current environment as a bull market.

  *   **Palantir:** Used as a prime example of a company achieving high growth with
  increased operational efficiency (revenue per employee).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Fed Manipulation:** The discussion heavily criticized the current monetary
  policy, arguing that the Fed is prioritizing asset price stability and avoiding
  prolonged recessions over maintaining the purchasing power of the US dollar (evidenced
  by significant dollar debasement).

  *   **Circuit Breakers:** The absence of circuit breakers in Bitcoin is contrasted
  with the stock market, where they are necessary tools to manage volatility caused
  by hours of operation and algorithmic trading.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  Bitcoin is currently in its "teenage years"—more mature than an infant but not yet
  an "adult" asset ($10 trillion market cap threshold). The industry is heading toward
  24/7, tokenized markets driven by the need for instant liquidity during macro events.
  In the stock market, the focus is shifting permanently toward efficiency and productivity
  gains over simple headcount expansion.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Investors, Institutional Analysts, and Macro-Focused Professionals.** This
  episode is highly valuable for those who need to understand the interplay between
  geopolitical noise, central bank policy, and asset allocation decisions in both
  traditional and digital markets.'
