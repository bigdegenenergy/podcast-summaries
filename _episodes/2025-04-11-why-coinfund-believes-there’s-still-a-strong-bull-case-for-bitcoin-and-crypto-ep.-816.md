    That's if it's earlier stage, it can be daily active users. And then also in addition
    to that fundamental growth, clear value capture in the token. So either buybacks
    or expectations for buybacks down the road where the team has been very clear
    that they want the token to accrue value.

    They're going to have to stimulate in order to so print money to fund those deficits

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Why CoinFund Believes There’s Still a Strong Bull Case
  for Bitcoin and Crypto - Ep. 816


  This episode of Unchained features Seth Gins, Managing Partner at CoinFund, discussing
  the recent market volatility driven by geopolitical trade policy (tariffs) and why,
  despite short-term macro headwinds, CoinFund maintains a strong long-term bullish
  outlook for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**:

  The discussion centers on the intersection of **macroeconomic policy (specifically
  US trade tariffs and potential stimulus)**, **crypto market dynamics (Bitcoin vs.
  Altcoins)**, and the **maturation of the crypto regulatory landscape** in the US.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Bitcoin''s Dual Nature**: Bitcoin currently trades with a dual identity: partly
  as a "digital gold" store of value, but significantly as a high-beta, risk-on asset
  tied to tech equities (like the Nasdaq). This explains why it gets dragged down
  by macro uncertainty affecting risk assets.

  *   **Altcoin Season Indicators**: The setup suggests a transition toward an environment
  where **Bitcoin dominance starts to fall**, signaling the beginning of a sustained
  altcoin season, driven by anticipated liquidity injections.

  *   **Maturation through Fundamentals**: Future outperformance among altcoins will
  increasingly depend on tangible fundamentals: revenue growth, daily active users
  (DAUs), and clear mechanisms for **token value capture** (e.g., buybacks).


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **The "Trump Put"**: The market is now factoring in a political backstop—a "Trump
  put"—where the administration is likely to intervene (via policy changes or stimulus)
  if market stress indicators, particularly in Treasury yields, become too volatile.

  *   **Stimulus is Coming**: The combination of global deficit spending and reactions
  to trade friction suggests that monetary stimulus (from China and eventually the
  Fed) is a near-term certainty, which historically acts as a tailwind for crypto.

  *   **Short-Term Caution, Long-Term Bullishness**: While the immediate setup suggests
  volatility, the underlying indicators (VIX, MOVE index) suggest positive forward
  returns over 30-90 days once the current uncertainty settles, leading to a strong
  medium-to-long-term outlook.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Seth Gins (CoinFund)**: The primary expert providing the investment thesis.

  *   **Arthur Hayes**: Mentioned in listener comments regarding his past predictions
  about market tops.

  *   **Paul Atkins**: Mentioned in the news recap as the newly confirmed SEC commissioner,
  signaling positive momentum for regulatory clarity.

  *   **Circle**: Mentioned in the news recap as potentially delaying its IPO due
  to market turbulence.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   **Positive Policy Momentum**: Despite macro chaos, the crypto industry has seen
  unexpectedly positive policy shifts this year, including momentum on a market structure
  bill, dropping cases against "good actors," and discussions around a **strategic
  Bitcoin reserve**.

  *   **Clarity on the Horizon**: The expectation is that the "rules of the road"
  for crypto in the US will be clarified within the next 12–18 months, creating a
  much more favorable environment for businesses and developers.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  The conversation suggests the industry is moving past a phase dominated solely by
  monetary easing (like 2020/2021) into a new phase where **policy clarity and fundamental
  token economics** will differentiate winners. The convergence of stimulus and regulatory
  acceptance points toward a significant medium-to-long-term growth cycle, likely
  including a robust altcoin season.


  **7. Target Audience**:

  **Crypto Investors, Portfolio Managers, and Web3 Strategists** who need to understand
  how current geopolitical risks are being weighed against long-term structural tailwinds
  (stimulus and regulation) in the digital asset space.'
