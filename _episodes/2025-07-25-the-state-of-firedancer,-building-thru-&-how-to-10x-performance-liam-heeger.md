    to client disagreement leading to potential chain halts, contrasting it implicitly
    with Ethereum's design values.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The technical downside... is that with and specifically on Solana, the consensus
    algorithm can really suffer if there is a disagreement about what the state of
    the chain is and that can happen just because there's a bug in one of the clients
    or the other.

  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The problem with that [Vitalik's RISC-V idea for EVM] is the way they wanted
    to do it would end up not actually helping with performance. It would help with
    things like maybe with proving the Ethereum virtual machine more efficiently with
    ZK and whatnot. But it actually would not help performance or it wouldn't necessarily
    actually make the developer experience better because it's still layered on top
    of the glut of history of EVM.

- impact_reason: Directly criticizes the single-leader model (like Solana's) for creating
    temporary monopolies over block space supply, which is inherently unfair.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So you see Proof of Stake out there and you see these single leader chains.
    So Solana, for example, a leader has a monopoly on all the block space for 1.6
    seconds. They can do whatever they want there. They control the supply, right?
    That's obviously not great.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: 'The core architectural decision for Threw: eliminating the leader

    accumulation can misalign validators from prioritizing network performance and
    user service.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Proof of Stake has this unique problem that it incentivizes people to accumulate
    capital. And I know, okay, now I'm sorry, it sounds like some sort of communist
    or something, but if they're accumulating capital, they're not as focused on the
    performance of the network.

    converted into increased voting power, directly linking immediate financial reward
    to long-term governance influence.'

  text: They get an opportunity to say, I want to turn this into more like we might
    call it more stake, right? I can take some of my money and turn that into that
    I just made and I can turn that into more power on the network, more voting power,
    right?

    directly into governance power ensures validators are financially motivated to
    maximize network throughput.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And so basically we can start to say like, hey, these validators, they can
    take money off the table and turn that into power on the network. And that is
    that incentive that gets profit aligned with profit aligned with the performance
    of the chain.

    allowing them to optimize block construction specifically for their users'' transactions.'

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: You could imagine like a DEX coming in, they capture all of their flows and
    they can actually build blocks for their users and actually build the best possible
    blocks. They can kind of push out all the sandwiching and capture all of those
    flows themselves, provide really low fees to their users.
  topic: defi/innovation
- impact_reason: Directly addresses the feasibility of zero-fee transactions by shifting
    the cost mechanism away from the end-user, which significantly improves UX.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: In fact, they can provide zero fees to their users and front all the costs
    for like by, you know, just say, I'll put the price in the block and I'll forward
    it on to the validator set for you. And so it's actually really powerful when
    you want to have like kind of either zero fee or very low fee transactions. It
    opens up a whole bunch of use cases.

    direction for the industry. I think that will be a huge benefit to us with the
    more regulatory clarity. It helps my co-founder and I can sleep at night about
    how we think about what we're doing and the value of it.
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: 'This is a critical distinction: because block producers are executing
    transactions on the L1, they must pay in the native token for execution resources,
    thereby avoiding the L2 value accrual problem where execution fees might be paid
    in a non-native token.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What they would do is they still have to maybe take some of their token, turn
    it back into native tokens and pay for the block space in the competitive environment
    that is going to be out there, right? So they still have to actually pay for the
    block space. And so, and it's not just data availability, right? This is actual
    execution, right? So that's not the same problem as the L2 conundrum that's currently
    rocking the Ethereum ecosystem.

    the VM performant and everybody can make their little VM performant... But I think
    we can all get to the same place on the VM. But expanding the developer pool isn't
    incredibly hard. But I wanted, I really wanted to set out to do this. That was

    who can take the most money off the table while also increasing their power within
    the network, right? And if they're all doing that and they're all competing in
    that kind of arena of who can be the best validator, then they can all, in theory,
    they're all actually, if they're all competing, then we'll have the, they will
    all also be focused on performance, on the performance of the network, on serving

  source: llm_enhanced

  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: One of the things that I think is very critical is that people say that Solana
    token exists to prevent spam. And I don't really, I don't believe that. And here's
    why. So the computers that are running Solana can filter things very efficiently,
    right? They look at the number, they say, oh, that's really low. That's not a
    price that's good enough for me to accept this transaction and they throw it away.
  topic: technology/scalability

    (unpredictability in transaction ordering/inclusion), suggesting that predictability
    solves the spam volume issue.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: They're spamming because the jitter, where they get in the block, is not easy
    to determine. It's not easy for them to kind of, it's not easy for those bots
    to kind of get where they need to be in the block. So they have to send a lot
    of transactions. So the jitter is high. And so that's a solved problem, I think.

    We could take in a whole bunch of blocks all at once and then kind of have a moment

    producers, right? So they can actually just capture the flows or they can actually
    participate in a community of participants, or it could be a blend, right? So
    there's also an opportunity for apps to make some money off of block production

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: The State Of Firedancer, Building Thru & How
  To 10x Performance | Liam Heeger


  This 47-minute episode features Jack Cubanek interviewing Liam Heeger, co-founder
  of **Unto Labs**, the team building the new Layer 1 blockchain **Threw**. The discussion
  centers on Heeger’s transition from a core engineer at **FireDancer** (Jump Crypto’s
  high-performance Solana client) to launching his own project, detailing the architectural
  philosophy behind Threw, and critiquing the limitations of existing high-throughput
  chains like Solana.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Blockchain Architecture and Performance Optimization**, specifically
  contrasting the single-leader model (Solana) with novel, leaderless consensus mechanisms.
  Key themes include Virtual Machine design (adopting **RISC-V**), incentive alignment
  for validators, and achieving high throughput without fixed block times, drawing
  parallels to traditional financial markets.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Threw VM based on RISC-V:** Threw is building a new Virtual Machine using
  the open-source **RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**. The main driver is
  not just performance, but maximizing developer optionality by supporting a wide
  range of existing languages (C, C++, Rust, Zig, etc.) directly.

  *   **Leaderless Consensus Mechanism:** Threw is designed to be completely **leaderless**,
  moving away from single-leader (Solana) or multiple-concurrent-leader (MCL) models.
  Block production is open to anyone (with a minimal token stake), while validators
  are separate and focus solely on voting and security.

  *   **Dynamic Block Finalization:** Threw rejects fixed block times (like Solana’s
  400ms slots). Instead, block finalization is determined by market dynamics—a continuous
  process where validators choose blocks based on the **price per resource (compute)**
  offered by the block producer, mirroring the bursty nature of traditional markets.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Demand Outstrips Supply:** Heeger emphasizes that the demand for high-throughput,
  on-chain products is rapidly increasing, creating a critical supply gap in block
  space that current L1s cannot adequately fill.

  *   **Incentive Alignment for Performance:** The design actively combats the PoS
  incentive mismatch where capital accumulation doesn''t necessarily align with network
  performance. Threw aims to align validator profit directly with network speed and
  user service quality.

  *   **Zero/Low Fee Transactions:** The architecture enables applications to offer
  near-zero fee transactions by allowing block producers (who can be the applications
  themselves) to front the small block production fee paid to validators.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Liam Heeger:** Co-founder of Unto Labs, ex-core engineer at FireDancer.

  *   **FireDancer (Jump Crypto):** Mentioned as a noble but difficult effort due
  to building against a constantly changing specification (a "moving target").

  *   **Vitalik Buterin:** Mentioned regarding the concept of Ethereum potentially
  moving to RISC-V, though Heeger notes their implementation focuses on native performance
  rather than layering on EVM history.

  *   **Max Resnick:** Mentioned in the context of supporting MCL solutions, which
  Heeger disagrees with as merely creating an oligopoly.

  *   **Temporal (Ben):** Mentioned as a source for insights regarding transaction
  spam and block jitter on existing chains.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No direct regulatory discussion occurred, but the context of increasing demand for
  on-chain products (referenced by a recent bill passing) underscores the growing
  importance of scalable infrastructure in the face of regulatory interest.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where high-performance blockchains move away
  from rigid, fixed-time slot mechanisms toward **event-driven, dynamic processing**
  that better reflects real-world market activity. The adoption of RISC-V could significantly
  broaden the developer ecosystem for new L1s beyond the current Rust/Solana or Solidity/EVM
  dominance.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Blockchain Engineers, Protocol Architects,
  Web3 Developers, and Crypto Investors/Analysts** focused on L1 scalability solutions,
  consensus mechanisms, and the technical trade-offs between different high-throughput
  designs.


  ---


  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast opens by framing Liam Heeger’s journey: leaving the high-profile **FireDancer**
  project at Jump Crypto to co-found **Unto Labs** and build the **Threw** blockchain,
  a move that resulted in a settled legal dispute over non-compete clauses. Heeger
  first addresses the challenges of building FireDancer, noting the extreme difficulty
  of engineering against a moving target (Solana’s evolving core code) and the inherent
  risks of client monoculture, even while acknowledging the positive impact FireDancer
  has had on Solana’s testing rigor.


  The central thesis is that **Solana is not performant enough** to meet escalating
  demand. Heeger argues that while Solana is fast, the fundamental architecture—specifically
  the **single-leader monopoly** over block space for 1.6 seconds—is inherently limiting.


  He then details the technical innovations of **Threw**. The core is the **Threw
  VM**, built from the ground up using the **RISC-V ISA**. This choice prioritizes
  broad developer accessibility by natively supporting languages like C++, Rust, and
  Zig, rather than focusing solely on micro-optimizations over the existing EVM structure.


  The most significant departure is in **consensus**. Threw is **completely leaderless**.
  Block producers can be anyone willing to post a small stake, and they compete to
