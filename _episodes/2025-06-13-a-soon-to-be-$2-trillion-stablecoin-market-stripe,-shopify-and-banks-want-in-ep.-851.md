    What I mean is right now everyone can bring a stablecoin... You have to deploy

    and Circle will be their top choice when they think about a stablecoin.

    AI commerce, emphasizing that true mainstream adoption requires abstracting away
    complex wallet management (self-custody UX).

  text: Even AI agents could use stablecoin USDC as a payment solution permissionlessly
    without any notice. That's where the mainstream adoption happens without much

    we store the recovery phrase or something like that.

    Bitcoin get more liquidity to make a yield for the Bitcoin holder. There are liquidity
    layers from the Bitcoin asset.
  topic: DeFi/Investment
- impact_reason: 'The core argument defending Circle against bank competition: USDC''s
    moat is its deep, established network effect across multiple blockchains and DeFi
    protocols, which banks cannot easily replicate.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The reason for that is the $60 billion in circulation Circle built is two
    parts. One is the liquidity comes in on all chains... And on top of that, all
    the decentralized exchanges or all the liquidity providers are using USDC in some
    kind of way to do the liquidity. So that's where it's the network effect. What's
    built is not easy to replace, right?
  topic: Technology/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Details the two pillars of USDC''s defensibility: 1) established
    on-chain network effect, and 2) superior off-ramp/on-ramp access and global user

    they can't replace that [USDC's network effect], right? And on the other side

    is actually a user experience problem and which central exchange will accept it.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: A Soon-to-Be $2 Trillion Stablecoin Market?
  Stripe, Shopify and Banks Want In - Ep. 851


  This episode of Unchained, hosted by Laura Shin, features **Vicky Foo**, Co-founder
  at Yala and former Engineering Director at Circle, discussing the rapidly evolving
  stablecoin landscape, catalyzed by recent major corporate moves and anticipated
  regulatory clarity. The central theme is the massive, underestimated infrastructure
  value being built around stablecoins, particularly USDC, moving them from niche
  crypto assets to foundational payment technology.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **stablecoin market infrastructure**, focusing on
  the strategic implications of the **Circle IPO**, the **Stripe acquisition of Privy**,
  the **Shopify/Coinbase/USDC integration**, the **Plasma ICO success**, and the potential
  impact of impending **US stablecoin legislation**. It frames stablecoins as the
  necessary upgrade for global payment technology, analogous to how AI agents are
  upgrading AI technology.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Circle''s Moat is Infrastructure, Not Just Revenue:** Circle’s true value
  lies in solving the "last-mile issue" of 24/7, real-time, global on/off-ramping
  for fiat into digital dollars, which required massive effort in securing bank relationships
  and maintaining complex three-way accounting (on-chain, online, bank).

  *   **Stablecoins as Settlement Vehicles:** Stablecoins, especially USDC, are becoming
  the underlying settlement vehicle for new payment networks, enabling cheaper, faster
  cross-border transactions, which traditional banking infrastructure struggles to
  match efficiently.

  *   **Network Effects in DeFi/Payments:** The established liquidity of USDC across
  numerous DeFi protocols and chains (e.g., its use in minting $1B USDC on Solana
  for the Trump token) creates a powerful, hard-to-replace network effect that new
  entrants struggle to replicate immediately.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Mispricing of Circle IPO:** The market fundamentally mispriced Circle by comparing
  its revenue model to Tether''s, ignoring its unique position as a regulated, North
  American-focused "digital dollar infrastructure with quasi-sovereign issuance rights."

  *   **Institutional Bullishness on Infrastructure:** The massive oversubscription
  of the Plasma ICO ($500M raised from ~1,000 wallets) signals strong institutional
  conviction in the need for dedicated, high-performance stablecoin infrastructure
  (like EVM-compatible sidechains).

  *   **Stablecoins as the Future of Money Movement:** The integration by giants like
  Stripe and Shopify validates the thesis that stablecoins offer superior efficiency
  for global commerce, potentially leading to a market valuation shift comparable
  to payment giants like Visa or PayPal, despite current lower revenue multiples.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Vicky Foo (Guest/Yala Co-founder):** Provided insider perspective on Circle’s
  strategic moat and the structural reasons for its IPO success.

  *   **Circle:** Highlighted for pioneering regulated stablecoin issuance and building
  critical global on/off-ramp infrastructure.

  *   **Stripe:** Signaled major commitment to stablecoin payments via the acquisition
  of **Privy** (a wallet with 75M accounts) and the prior acquisition of stablecoin
  infrastructure company **Bridge**.

  *   **Shopify & Coinbase:** Partnered to allow 2M+ Shopify merchants to accept USDC
  payments, including on the Base network.

  *   **Plasma:** Noted for its highly successful $500M ICO for a Bitcoin sidechain
  focused on stablecoin performance.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The impending passage of a **US stablecoin bill in the Senate** is seen as a major
  catalyst, signaling regulatory acceptance and encouraging further institutional
  adoption. This legislative clarity is expected to unlock significant investment
  and adoption, attracting major banks (like Société Générale) to launch their own
  dollar-pegged stablecoins.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward **mainstream adoption of stablecoin payments** facilitated
  by better user experience (UX) built by infrastructure players. This will happen
  largely permissionlessly, where users interact with USDC payments through familiar
  apps (like Venmo, or even AI agents) without needing to manage complex wallet mechanics.
  While banks entering the space is inevitable, established players like Circle maintain
  a significant advantage due to their existing network effects, global on-ramp capabilities,
  and established DeFi integration.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Investors, Fintech Professionals, Payment
  Industry Strategists, and Institutional Analysts** seeking deep insights into the
  business models underpinning stablecoin infrastructure and the strategic moves of
  major tech and financial players entering the digital dollar ecosystem.'
