- actionable: true
  confidence: medium
  extracted: start normalizing disclosure of market making agreements now the market
    makers will fucking hate this they absolutely will not want their agreements to
    be public this is what happens on s1 yeah this is normal and disclosed with all
    traditional securities yeah yeah totally totally every single issuer who wants
    to trade on the nest that goes out and gets three market makers it's a requirement
    it's like you must have three market makers but the the actual agreement like
    the market make agreement as well as all the covenants and all the side letters
    if those are all disclosed in crypto this problem basically goes away now of course
    you can always lie and like you know not disclose all of them but then okay now
    you're committing outright fraud and okay if someone commits fraud there's not
    that much you can do to stop that but having that I think is how you solve this
    problem curious wait what do you guys think well I think it's I mean first of
    all there's a difference between like the projects that would even go into a disclosure
    regime voluntarily in the projects which wouldn't an offshore project that has
    a crazy checkered history I'm not saying if they're registering with US I just
    mean there's a norm in the industry like you want to get listed on by and so I
    want to get listed on Coinbase you have to publicly disclose all of your micimagreements
    right if this was like a we'll call itself regulatory set of requirements that
    Coinbase and yeah that's an unpropeasant that's an unpropeasant yeah I mean if
    everyone implemented that they'd be great right like the more information that's
    out there the better because you'll get a better allocation of capital to the
    real projects and less capital allocated to the bad projects there'll be less
    people complaining that they got rugged by some crazy manipulated asset and more
    capital be available for the projects that are building amazing stuff and maybe
    I'll take that other side not more as playing down as I've get but yeah I kind
    of agree with that philosophically but I would say incentive wise if you think
    about a centralized exchange whether it's in Tragifie or in crypto the job of
    a centralized exchange is to maximize fees like just from their profit calculation
    is to maximize fees and volume I can collect while offshoring the risk of market
    making and kind of like having to hold inventory risk right like effectively the
    goal is like you're subsidizing market makers via discounts and rebates and all
    these other things to try to get them to hold inventory risks so that you can
    collect fees without you holding the risk right that's sort of the trade-off and
    I do think there's sort of this inherent thing where like if you start enforcing
    these things all these market makers will like leave and I think to break that
    you probably need a real regulatory regime I don't think like that then there'll
    be like a natural state in which you get an equilibrium where the disclosure thing
    will have the exchanges will force the disclosure well why why wouldn't the exchanges
    I mean look I think it's pretty clear that the exchanges themselves have seen
    that their customers are losing trust in them when they list these kinds of tokens
    right like basically at any point you got have you ever looked at have you ever
    looked at tokens around up bit listings I don't think that's always true right
    like some of them are making much more in fees by actually having this happen
    yeah but I mean you can see from finances behavior right like I mean they recently
    did this big Twitter space where they were like basically this kind of thing Binance
    is the one company that never gets chastised for listing dog shit tokens and recently
    their community has started basically rebelling against Binance and saying what
    the fuck are all these garbage listings everything is down only and and when you
    get something like home which again Binance okay acts by bit it was it was listed
    everywhere this makes people lose trust in that hey can I trust these new token
    listings now at the margin is it is it everyone's leaving no but is it bad for
    business clearly so their interest overwhelmingly is like look most trading volume
    is not in chic ones most trading volume is in the majors I agree with you but
    I also think there's like this like weird incentive thing is like you're forcing
    the exchanges to take more risk but in some indirect way by making them have these
    kind of listing procedures and that they may have to pay a lot more to get more
    risk because they may have to pay makers a lot more in rebates to get change the
    maker makers aren't the projects paying the market makers the exchanges are offering
    rebates right like how do I ensure there's enough liquidity on a certain side
    unless until you get to major status when you're a new listing just like in an
    IPO market you effectively have to provide rebates right like every exchange in
    the world relies on rebates as this like indirect incentive mechanism for me to
    outsource the inventory risk that I'm supposed to be that needs to be held in
    the exchange right and my point is I bet you that the adding these types of disclosure
    things actually increases the cost they exchange just to pay in terms of rebates
    to get the same outcome so that but the project not the exchange yeah yeah forcing
    forcing forcing the market maker agreement disclosure makes the market makers
    make a lot of money that they want I think the exchanges are all agreed to quote
    at a particular rebate my point is they will demand a higher rebate in exchange
    for the disclosure and I'm not sure that's why does that cost get why why would
    the exchanges or that cost why wouldn't they push it onto the projects like the
    projects at this point if you're buying ants or if you're Coinbase you this is
    like an extremely inelastic market I think you have one reason one reason you
    don't have this is once these agreements are public it's a one-way function you
    can't turn back because now everyone knows everyone's true cost now the projects
    will be like well you charge this other project this amount totally totally so
    the market maker is already made it no no no but that's my point that's why they
    will demand a higher incentive in rebates from the exchange in order to to make
    up for that but why would they extract a higher price from the project why would
    they extract it from the exchange because my point is now the projects have transparency
    and pricing they can see what other projects paid and be like fuck you I'm not
    going to pay or like oh try to find you know what I mean like they're going to
    run the board price could just go up yeah I mean but I don't think I'm talking
    Amber whoever I you know this project before the disclosure regime started only
    cost this much now the cost has gone up because you're right the opportunity cost
    has increased to print ideal out there I think some of that cost will go to the
    exchange it inevitably I don't think it's like all going to be born by the the
    kind of project because there is this sort of like aggregate thing by like disclosing
    all the exact fee agreements and fee schedules and loan terms and etc you're effectively
    making it much harder for the market makers to do future agreements and they will
    want some premium for that discount you know like that I agree with you so I would
    bet you're so I think it may be actually the other way around is that the best
    market makers actually have a net benefit and the crappy the shady market makers
    basically lose a ton of business and what you may end up doing is kind of pushing
    more and more of the demand to a smaller set of market makers such that even even
    though like yes if they had the same set of customers they would they would be
    hurt but actually the total demand increases and people at the bottom of the food
    chain of market makers they basically got a business right if you have something
    that's so extractive or so shady that basically no project we willing to disclose
    it you're the ones who got a business because you had you had no edge I think
    that beyond in tradify that ends up being more true because you enforce things
    like nbbo where you force all the exchanges to have synchronized prices and if
    you don't use the exchange get in trouble but in crypto I can always just start
    a new exchange that is focused on only the shittiest stuff right like I look at
    your to start there's already a bunch of them yeah yeah yeah that's what I'm saying
    but but my point is like you will just move that volume away and then you as a
    big exchange now you're competing against those small ones right like I'm saying
    finance is not afraid of that right coin base finance up it these guys are not
    afraid of that I I think finance is afraid of up it and up it would rather have
    more of these kind of tokens right like they they have a different risk preference
    in terms of this listing stuff I mean I think that the I think up is there's more
    risk of worse than finance like the finance less way more stuff than up it does
    yes but I think you're thinking about like a gate or a mexi which I don't think
    finances yeah probably don't care about the short term yeah exactly the kind of
    exchange you're describing I I just kind of think this idea that you're going
    to squeeze out all the the bad market make it's like a little bit too much of
    a just so story I think the the costs will be split between the projects and the
    exchange if you cause a public disclosure because of this notion notion of future
    bargaining power changing and I think that will mean it's kind of like either
    very take the long time to reach that naturally without a regulatory force or
    you it kind of is an unstable thing where like what's a who do you think gains
    in the story who loses and who gains because okay you're saying the exchange loses
    and the market makers lose that that sounds implausible right then who gains who
    gains is the the the the the user welfare for the like median or trader right
    like right now if I think about these like bad coin I think that's a bad mental
    model that like finances gaining from having like really shitty token because
    like people are going to trade whatever's on Binance you know like crypto traders
    are just addicted to crypto trade and there might be more trading that occurs
    if everyone's like oh all the assets are good assets like I know yeah if the assets
    go up and people are not as worried about rug pulls they will likely be more trading
    right like Binance is not in sore need of I need more random craptalist so like
    tending the garden and making sure that the assets on Binance go up and our good
    investments is good for Binance's overall trading volume right like what's good
    for retail is good for Binance I just think that yes that that's sort of like
    a nice end state but I don't think that that they're like oh we're gonna do that
    tomorrow right like it's the type of thing where like they are forsaking some
    revenue now and they will have to make this very clear decision to be like we
    are cutting off 20% of our revenue with this goal right like that's what I'm saying
    like you're asking for the sharp chain on 20% of revenue they don't even make
    20% of the revenue from spot I don't know what I'm just pick I'm picking a number
    to illustrate like sure sure depending on the type of work you're tiring you sliver
    but it's a tiny sliver but but I'm saying like that that is like a thing where
    I think like a lot of places will have trouble being like oh yes we want to cut
    that out right coin basically I think would totally do right but sure Binance
    I'm not really sure but the thing if you if you're a top project and you don't
    have a coin base listing like something something something is wrong I think there
    probably would have to need there wouldn't probably need to be at least a little
    bit of synchronization in order for this norm to actually spread if both Binance
    and Coinbase did this the whole industry was good

    these things all these market makers will like leave and I think to break that
    you probably need a real regulatory regime I don't think like that then there'll
    be like a natural state in which you get an equilibrium where the disclosure thing
    will have the exchanges will force the disclosure well why why wouldn't the exchanges
    I mean look I think it's pretty clear that the exchanges themselves have seen
    that their customers are losing trust in them when they list these kinds of tokens
    right like basically at any point you got have you ever looked at have you ever
    looked at tokens around up bit listings I don't think that's always true right
    like some of them are making much more in fees by actually having this happen
    yeah but I mean you can see from finances behavior right like I mean they recently
    did this big Twitter space where they were like basically this kind of thing Binance
    is the one company that never gets chastised for listing dog shit tokens and recently
    their community has started basically rebelling against Binance and saying what
    the fuck are all these garbage listings everything is down only and and when you
    get something like home which again Binance okay acts by bit it was it was listed
    everywhere this makes people lose trust in that hey can I trust these new token
    listings now at the margin is it is it everyone's leaving no but is it bad for
    business clearly so their interest overwhelmingly is like look most trading volume
    is not in chic ones most trading volume is in the majors I agree with you but
    I also think there's like this like weird incentive thing is like you're forcing
    the exchanges to take more risk but in some indirect way by making them have these
    kind of listing procedures and that they may have to pay a lot more to get more
    risk because they may have to pay makers a lot more in rebates to get change the
    maker makers aren't the projects paying the market makers the exchanges are offering
    rebates right like how do I ensure there's enough liquidity on a certain side
    unless until you get to major status when you're a new listing just like in an
    IPO market you effectively have to provide rebates right like every exchange in
    the world relies on rebates as this like indirect incentive mechanism for me to
    outsource the inventory risk that I'm supposed to be that needs to be held in
    the exchange right and my point is I bet you that the adding these types of disclosure
    things actually increases the cost they exchange just to pay in terms of rebates
    to get the same outcome so that but the project not the exchange yeah yeah forcing
    forcing forcing the market maker agreement disclosure makes the market makers
    make a lot of money that they want I think the exchanges are all agreed to quote
    at a particular rebate my point is they will demand a higher rebate in exchange
    for the disclosure and I'm not sure that's why does that cost get why why would
    the exchanges or that cost why wouldn't they push it onto the projects like the
    projects at this point if you're buying ants or if you're Coinbase you this is
    like an extremely inelastic market I think you have one reason one reason you
    don't have this is once these agreements are public it's a one-way function you
    can't turn back because now everyone knows everyone's true cost now the projects
    will be like well you charge this other project this amount totally totally so
    the market maker is already made it no no no but that's my point that's why they
    will demand a higher incentive in rebates from the exchange in order to to make
    up for that but why would they extract a higher price from the project why would
    they extract it from the exchange because my point is now the projects have transparency
    and pricing they can see what other projects paid and be like fuck you I'm not
    going to pay or like oh try to find you know what I mean like they're going to
    run the board price could just go up yeah I mean but I don't think I'm talking
    Amber whoever I you know this project before the disclosure regime started only
    cost this much now the cost has gone up because you're right the opportunity cost
    has increased to print ideal out there I think some of that cost will go to the
    exchange it inevitably I don't think it's like all going to be born by the the
    kind of project because there is this sort of like aggregate thing by like disclosing
    all the exact fee agreements and fee schedules and loan terms and etc you're effectively
    making it much harder for the market makers to do future agreements and they will
    want some premium for that discount you know like that I agree with you so I would
    bet you're so I think it may be actually the other way around is that the best
    market makers actually have a net benefit and the crappy the shady market makers
    basically lose a ton of business and what you may end up doing is kind of pushing
    more and more of the demand to a smaller set of market makers such that even even
    though like yes if they had the same set of customers they would they would be
    hurt but actually the total demand increases and people at the bottom of the food
    chain of market makers they basically got a business right if you have something
    that's so extractive or so shady that basically no project we willing to disclose
    it you're the ones who got a business because you had you had no edge I think
    that beyond in tradify that ends up being more true because you enforce things
    like nbbo where you force all the exchanges to have synchronized prices and if
    you don't use the exchange get in trouble but in crypto I can always just start
    a new exchange that is focused on only the shittiest stuff right like I look at
    your to start there's already a bunch of them yeah yeah yeah that's what I'm saying
    but but my point is like you will just move that volume away and then you as a
    big exchange now you're competing against those small ones right like I'm saying
    finance is not afraid of that right coin base finance up it these guys are not
    afraid of that I I think finance is afraid of up it and up it would rather have
    more of these kind of tokens right like they they have a different risk preference
    in terms of this listing stuff I mean I think that the I think up is there's more
    risk of worse than finance like the finance less way more stuff than up it does
    yes but I think you're thinking about like a gate or a mexi which I don't think
    finances yeah probably don't care about the short term yeah exactly the kind of
    exchange you're describing I I just kind of think this idea that you're going
    to squeeze out all the the bad market make it's like a little bit too much of
    a just so story I think the the costs will be split between the projects and the
    exchange if you cause a public disclosure because of this notion notion of future
    bargaining power changing and I think that will mean it's kind of like either
    very take the long time to reach that naturally without a regulatory force or
    you it kind of is an unstable thing where like what's a who do you think gains
    in the story who loses and who gains because okay you're saying the exchange loses
    and the market makers lose that that sounds implausible right then who gains who
    gains is the the the the the user welfare for the like median or trader right
    like right now if I think about these like bad coin I think that's a bad mental
    model that like finances gaining from having like really shitty token because
    like people are going to trade whatever's on Binance you know like crypto traders
    are just addicted to crypto trade and there might be more trading that occurs
    if everyone's like oh all the assets are good assets like I know yeah if the assets
    go up and people are not as worried about rug pulls they will likely be more trading
    right like Binance is not in sore need of I need more random craptalist so like
    tending the garden and making sure that the assets on Binance go up and our good
    investments is good for Binance's overall trading volume right like what's good
    for retail is good for Binance I just think that yes that that's sort of like
    a nice end state but I don't think that that they're like oh we're gonna do that
    tomorrow right like it's the type of thing where like they are forsaking some
    revenue now and they will have to make this very clear decision to be like we
    are cutting off 20% of our revenue with this goal right like that's what I'm saying
    like you're asking for the sharp chain on 20% of revenue they don't even make
    20% of the revenue from spot I don't know what I'm just pick I'm picking a number
    to illustrate like sure sure depending on the type of work you're tiring you sliver
    but it's a tiny sliver but but I'm saying like that that is like a thing where
    I think like a lot of places will have trouble being like oh yes we want to cut
    that out right coin basically I think would totally do right but sure Binance
    I'm not really sure but the thing if you if you're a top project and you don't
    have a coin base listing like something something something is wrong I think there
    probably would have to need there wouldn't probably need to be at least a little
    bit of synchronization in order for this norm to actually spread if both Binance
    and Coinbase did this the whole industry was good.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: The Chopping Block: OM’s Collapse, Vitalik’s Morality
  Test, & Tariff Chaos - Ep. 819


  This episode of The Chopping Block dives into a volatile mix of global macroeconomics,
  specifically the US-China trade situation, and a major crypto market event involving
  the collapse of the OM token (Mantra). The hosts, a group of early-stage crypto
  investors, offer their insider perspectives on market dynamics, regulatory ambiguity,
  and project integrity.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Global Macroeconomics (US-China Trade Tariffs)** and
  **Cryptocurrency Market Integrity/DeFi Failures**, with a specific focus on token
  liquidity manipulation and project opacity.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Liquidity Misrepresentation Mechanics:** The discussion detailed how projects
  can artificially inflate their circulating supply metrics reported to aggregators
  (like CoinGecko/CMC). This involves claiming self-custody over large portions of
  the supposed "community distribution" and routing tokens through market makers to
  generate fake volume, resulting in extremely low *actual* retail float and easy
  price manipulation.

  *   **DeFi as an Antidote (Theoretical):** While not deeply explored, the hosts
  suggest that robust DeFi protocols are theoretically the antidote to the opacity
  and centralized control seen in projects like OM, implying that transparent, on-chain
  mechanisms should prevent such liquidity traps.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Tariff Uncertainty Freezes Producers:** The inconsistent communication around
  US tariffs has created significant uncertainty, causing producers to halt investment
  decisions, acting as a drag on the real economy.

  *   **Bullish Case for Bitcoin via Fed Intervention:** The capital flight from US
  assets (weakening stocks *and* Treasuries simultaneously) suggests the Fed may be
  forced to intervene with liquidity injections (rate cuts or QE) sooner than expected
  to protect the dollar and bond market, which could buoy financial assets, including
  crypto.

  *   **Red Flag for Opaque Projects:** The OM collapse serves as a major warning
  sign regarding projects with high nominal market caps but extremely low liquidity
  and opaque backing (often associated with Middle Eastern/Dubai family money, as
  cited for OM).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **OM (Mantra):** The token that experienced a near 90% crash in 90 minutes due
  to a forced liquidation event revealing near-zero actual liquidity, despite being
  a top-25 asset.

  *   **Bill Ackman:** Mentioned as potentially instigating the 90-day pause in some
  tariffs.

  *   **Mosy (@IvanaCharmer):** The Twitter personality credited with heavily promulgating
  the warnings about OM’s low float before the crash.

  *   **Coffeezilla:** Mentioned in relation to an interview with the OM founder,
  where the founder allegedly offered a weak defense, seemingly defining market manipulation
  narrowly (i.e., only if *they* explicitly trade it, not if a third party does).

  *   **Vitalik Buterin:** Briefly mentioned in the title, though the transcript focuses
  more on macro and OM; his "morality test" likely relates to judging the integrity
  of projects.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Tariff Diplomacy as "Teenage Diplomacy":** The hosts heavily criticized the
  Trump administration''s tariff rollout as inconsistent, unpredictable, and lacking
  in strategic game theory, comparing it to childish bargaining where allies and adversaries
  are treated similarly.

  *   **Incentive for Bilateral Deals:** The GTO solution to the tariff chaos is that
  every country is incentivized to settle quickly with the US to gain a competitive
  advantage over others who remain tariffed.

  *   **Lack of Enforcement on Float Data:** The current system relies heavily on
  self-reported data for circulating supply metrics on major aggregators, creating
  a massive vulnerability for manipulation.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward increased scrutiny of tokenomics, especially for
  projects claiming high market caps without verifiable, deep liquidity. Furthermore,
  the global trade instability increases the probability that Bitcoin will be tested
  as a "credibly neutral" asset in a fracturing global economic order.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Investors and Analysts (especially DeFi/Tokenomics focused)**, as well
  as **Macro Strategists** interested in the intersection of geopolitical risk and
  asset performance.'
