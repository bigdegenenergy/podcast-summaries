    model that AI summarization is disrupting.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The problem with that is it hurts the ecosystem that the whole web, the open
    web, is built on, which is take some of my content, index it, and then give me
    a link. So when someone looks for something that I have, you send them to me and
    I get the traffic as the publisher, as the creator.
  topic: Business/Ecosystem

    ecosystem collapse.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But with AI, I just get the answer. No need to go to the site. Great user
    experience. Terrible for the ecosystem because without that traffic as a publisher,
    I can't pay for the content that I'm producing.
  topic: Technology/Business
- impact_reason: 'This is the technical core of RSL: using an existing file (robots.txt)
    to convey granular, machine-readable licensing terms.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We can create an open standard that allows anybody to articulate their license
    terms for any piece of content. We can put that right in robots.txt, and crawlers
    can see it and they can say, oh, I now know what the licensing terms are, and
    I can then go away if I don't want to do it, or I can agree to those licensing
    terms.
  topic: Technology/Standards

    like RSL, highlighting the existential threat to AI training data quality without
    compensation.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We need an ecosystem that's going to survive AI and allow creators of content

  topic: Technology/Industry Trends

    and the current AI/content crisis, positioning the RSL effort as the 'Apple moment'
    for web content.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: That to me makes me think of the early days of music on the web. Napster was
    taking everybody's music... But it was not going to be sustainable in that model
    because they weren't paying for anything. And to Apple's credit, they went to
    ASCAP and said, 'We need a license structure where we can actually license all
    the music and pay for it.'
  topic: Industry Trends/Business
- impact_reason: 'Highlights a massive, often overlooked benefit for AI companies:
    licensing high-quality, verified content directly reduces compute costs and drastically
    improves output quality by mitigating hallucinations.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What happens when you do that, billions of dollars and compute cost, and subpar
    answers that have their own hallucinations? Instead, if your content—if they have
    access to content that actually answers a question—just give that content... You
    don't have to worry about hallucinations.

  topic: Business/Platform Power
- impact_reason: Explains why the previous defensive strategy (blocking crawlers)
    is now obsolete or actively harmful due to platform integration requirements.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Blocking was a technique that made a lot of sense when you could still get
    traffic. But with things like Google that says you can't block our AI abstracts,
    if you do it this way, you're basically blocking your ability to show up in search.
  topic: Business/Strategy

    and validates its model by referencing the long-standing success of ASCAP in the
    music industry.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: That's why we are building the RSL Collective, which is a collective rights

    licensing into a single, recognizable agreement for AI developers.'

  text: '...and basically says, okay, let''s take all the content—really, our goal

  text: Reddit... was actually the most cited or sourced kind of out of large language
    models. I saw 40%, yeah, which is such a high amount.
  topic: Industry Trends/Data
- impact_reason: Uses a highly relatable analogy (Spotify/music licensing) to explain
    the usage-based payment model, which is fair for both sides.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Very similar to how Spotify works when they license music rights from ASCAP
    or other collective rights organizations, and they pay out when someone plays
    a song. But if you don't play the song, you don't get paid...
  topic: Business/Model
- impact_reason: Demonstrates the technical flexibility and interoperability of the
    RSL standard across various modern AI architectures (RAG, generative web) and
    content formats (including DRM).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: RSL works with generative web, it works with RAG, it works with it very well,
    works with MCP and NL Web. The architect of NL Web was also a co-creator of our
    standard. So, it works in all these formats, and it doesn't have to be a human-readable
    site.
  topic: Technology
- impact_reason: 'Offers a clear, actionable strategic path for AI developers: focus
    on product innovation, but integrate mandatory, usage-based payment for licensed
    data.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The path to go down is license everything you want. You build your product
    the way you think makes sense for your consumers, but then when you use content,
    pay for that content, just for the ones you've used.
  topic: Business/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'A key prediction: licensing leads to a dual benefit of higher quality
    data and lower operational costs for LLMs.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The quality is going to improve when they start licensing this. The cost will
    go down, not just the transaction cost, but the actual compute cost will go down.
  topic: Technology/Business
- impact_reason: Introduces the crucial legal/enforcement mechanism, offering small
    publishers the power of collective litigation against infringement.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Modeled after ASCAP, collective enforcement is part of this. So, if you join
    us and you start getting infringed, the whole collective can battle in court for
    you instead of just you.
  topic: Business/Strategy
- impact_reason: Provides historical context, drawing a direct parallel between early
    search engines and current generative AI functions, highlighting the evolution
    of 'answering questions.'
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I started really in search. I ran a search engine called Ask.com or Ask Jeeves...
    Really, if you think back about it, it was trying to do what AI is doing now,
    but with humans answering questions and sending you to links.
  topic: Technology/History
- impact_reason: Defines the limitation of existing web standards, setting the stage
    for why RSL is necessary—it needs to convey licensing terms, not just access permission.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: robots.txt is a way to say, yes, you can crawl me, or no, you can't crawl
    me, but that's all it can do. They can't do more than that.
  topic: Technology/Standards
- impact_reason: Analyzes the AI company's perspective, suggesting that the sheer
    volume of individual negotiations makes mass licensing via a collective necessary
    for scale.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The AI companies really will face a choice there. Either I'm not going to
    negotiate—if I'm the AI company, I'm not going to negotiate a million times with
    a million different publishers... or I'll just not take it and I'll go to something
    else because the web is filled with close competitors of content.
  topic: Business/Strategy
- impact_reason: Highlights the low-risk, high-reward nature of joining the collective
    for publishers (free, non-exclusive, opt-out).
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Joining is free, doesn't cost anything to join. You can opt out at any time.
    It's non-exclusive, but basically, what you're telling us is, 'Hey, we exist,
    and please go negotiate on our behalf for compensation for our content.'
  topic: Startups/Adoption
- impact_reason: 'The strategic goal: achieving negotiating leverage through collective
    scale (''critical mass'').'
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What we believe will happen once we get this critical mass... is a better
    deal with the AI companies.
  topic: Business/Strategy
- impact_reason: Reveals the stated technical barrier cited by AI companies for not
    licensing content, setting up the RSL solution as the necessary 'protocol' to
    overcome this.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: They've said, 'We need a new protocol.'... In some of the litigation that
    they're involved in, they've made a statement like, 'Well, the reason we can't
    license everything is because it's technically impossible.'
  topic: Industry Trends
- impact_reason: Provides a stark, tripartite strategic framework for content publishers
    navigating the AI disruption.
  relevance_score: 8

  text: 'Publishing companies have three choices: you can either try to sue the big
    AI labs, you can partner... or you can maybe just go out of business...'
  topic: Business/Startups
- impact_reason: Summarizes the 'win-win' proposition of the proposed licensing model.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: 'The ecosystem benefits on both sides: creators get paid, and AI companies
    get a lower cost of higher-quality content.'
  topic: Business
- impact_reason: Confirms active engagement from major LLM players, signaling that
    the industry is taking this protocol seriously.
  relevance_score: 8

  text: We have received interest from some of the major LLM companies, but we're
    putting together what those license terms are with the perspective of our publisher
    steering committee...
  topic: Industry Trends
- impact_reason: Directly addresses the traffic decline problem, framing the RSL model
    as a necessary revenue stream decoupled from direct website visits.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Fewer and fewer people are actually visiting websites. So, I get how RSL...
    can help in general because maybe companies and publishing companies can still
    make money without people ever going to their website if they're getting paid
    per crawl, per citation...

    are set by their peers, not by the technology platforms.

summary: '## Summary of Everyday AI Show: Really Simple Licensing (RSL) and Saving
  the Open Web


  This episode of the Everyday AI Show, hosted by Jordan Wilson, features an in-depth
  discussion with **Doug Leads**, Co-founder of **Really Simple Licensing (RSL)**,
  focusing on a critical threat to the open web ecosystem: the impact of generative
  AI models consuming content without compensation or clear licensing frameworks.


  ### 1. Main Narrative Arc and Key Discussion Points


  The central narrative revolves around the existential threat posed by AI models
  (like Google''s AI Overviews, ChatGPT, and Perplexity) that provide direct answers,
  bypassing the need for users to click through to original source websites. This
  shift starves publishers of necessary traffic, undermining their ability to monetize
  content (via ads or subscriptions) and ultimately threatening the sustainability
  of high-quality, human-created content that fuels the AI models themselves. RSL
  is presented as the necessary protocol and organizational structure to solve this
  imbalance.


  ### 2. Major Topics, Themes, and Subject Areas Covered


  *   **The AI Content Consumption Crisis:** The shift from link-based search to direct
  AI answers and its negative impact on publisher traffic and revenue.

  *   **Licensing and Copyright:** Establishing machine-readable standards for content
  usage rights.

  *   **The Role of Collective Rights Organizations:** Modeling a solution after music
  industry bodies (like ASCAP) to streamline licensing negotiations.

  *   **Publisher Adoption and Momentum:** Highlighting early supporters and the strategy
  for achieving critical mass.

  *   **Benefits for AI Companies:** How licensing legally accessed, high-quality
  data can reduce compute costs and improve answer quality (reducing hallucinations).


  ### 3. Technical Concepts, Methodologies, or Frameworks Discussed


  *   **Really Simple Licensing (RSL) Standard:** An open, machine-readable standard
  (found at RSLstandard.org) that allows content creators to articulate their license
  terms directly within existing web infrastructure, specifically referencing **robots.txt**.
  This is contrasted with the limited functionality of `robots.txt` alone.

  *   **RSL Collective:** A collective rights organization built on top of the RSL
  standard. It acts as a central negotiating body for AI companies seeking blanket
  licenses for content from participating publishers.

  *   **Analogy to RSS:** Doug’s partner, Eckerd Walther (co-creator of RSS), was
  instrumental in developing RSL, drawing parallels between creating a web standard
  for content syndication and creating one for content licensing.

  *   **Generative Web, RAG, and NL Web:** RSL is designed to be compatible across
  various AI consumption methods, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).


  ### 4. Business Implications and Strategic Insights


  *   **The Unsustainability of "Stealing":** The current model of AI companies taking
  content without payment is unsustainable, leading to litigation (e.g., the Propel
  settlement) and a future lack of quality training data.

  *   **Streamlining Negotiation:** The RSL Collective solves the "million negotiations"
  problem for LLM companies by offering a single blanket license, similar to how streaming
  services license music rights.

  *   **Publisher Options:** Publishers currently face three choices: sue, partner
  independently, or go out of business. RSL offers a structured, collective partnership
  path.

  *   **Quality vs. Cost:** Licensing high-quality, human-written content via RSL
  allows AI companies to bypass expensive, complex data mashing, leading to lower
  compute costs and higher-quality, less hallucinatory outputs.


  ### 5. Key Personalities and Thought Leaders Mentioned


  *   **Doug Leads:** Co-founder of Really Simple Licensing; former executive at Ask.com
  and instrumental in building the media group that became Dotdash Meredith.

  *   **Eckerd Walther:** Doug’s partner, co-creator of **RSS (Really Simple Syndication)**,
  and the architect behind the RSL standard.

  *   **Stephen Johnson:** Co-founder of NotebookLM (mentioned during the sponsor
  break).


  ### 6. Predictions, Trends, or Future-Looking Statements


  *   Doug predicts that once critical mass is achieved via the RSL Collective, major
  LLM companies will engage in licensing deals because it offers a lower-cost, higher-quality
  data pipeline.

  *   The goal is to see the first licensing deal finalized "not too long" from the
  recording date.

  *   The future of high-quality content relies on creators being compensated, ensuring
  the AI ecosystem continues to have valuable data to train on.


  ### 7. Practical Applications and Actionable Advice


  *   **For Publishers:** Visit **RSLcollective.org** to register interest and join
  the collective. Joining is currently **free, non-exclusive, and allows publishers
  to opt-out anytime**. This signals interest to AI companies and authorizes the collective
  to negotiate on their behalf.

  *   **For AI Companies:** RSL provides a clear, scalable protocol to legally access
  and pay for the content needed to improve model quality and reduce operational costs.


  ### 8. Controversies, Challenges, or Problems Highlighted


  *   **The "I Don''t Like It" Approach:** The current default behavior of AI companies
  has been to take content without permission, forcing publishers into litigation
  or traffic loss.

  *   **Critical Mass:** The primary immediate challenge for RSL is building sufficient
  publisher adoption so that the collective represents enough valuable data to make
  negotiating with AI companies worthwhile for the LLM providers.

  *   **Enforcement:** The collective model includes **collective enforcement**, meaning
  if a member is infringed upon, the entire collective can pursue legal action, offering
  stronger protection than individual publishers could manage.
