    at it is not the world we live in today.
  topic: adoption/strategy

    cut spending/deficit leads inevitably to currency debasement, which is the fundamental
    bullish case for Bitcoin.'

    and based on the fact that Doge hasn't found anything. And we already backed off

    okay, well, then the easier solution is what we've been doing, which is we're
    going to try to grow our way out of this by debasing the currency and bonds will

  topic: defi/investment
- impact_reason: 'Provides a concise, high-level framework for understanding the fundamental
    tension driving modern monetary and political policy: innovation (deflation) vs.
    political necessity (inflationary spending).'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: if you view the world as two components, one is deflationary, which is innovation,
    and the other one is inflationary, which is the government defending the median
    worker who is displaced by the deflation.
  topic: strategy/technology
- impact_reason: 'Crucial insight into the accounting arbitrage of AI CapEx: massive
    spending boosts current revenue for suppliers (like Nvidia) but only registers
    as a small depreciation expense for the spenders (Mag 7), artificially inflating
    current S&P 500 profitability.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: the most important factor that came out of Q1 and the most dominant factor
    going on is the math behind AI. So everyone knows the $300 billion of CapEx. But
    $300 billion of CapEx is a spending number, but it doesn't count as an expense
    for those companies this year. So it's not like they have to make $300 billion
    of revenues to offset it. That number gets depreciated over seven to 10 years.

  text: Cursor, I think, is at $300 million ARR now. You're talking about two companies,

    immediately threatens the productivity and necessity of the majority of existing

  text: The fact that you can do this means anything built on code is obviously at
    risk. The number one thing that AI is doing is replicating code, and even though
    it won't be ever as good as, let's say, the top 2% of coders, you're still replacing
    the bottom 80% already...
  topic: technology/adoption

    of AI infrastructure spending.

  text: You're not losing jobs and you're growing CapEx to build out this massive
    infrastructure, which means more power. So all of the noise that people are hearing,
    I agree with you. It's really negative. It's a really bad place to worry about
    the next three years if you need to save money. If you've taken your money out
    and put it in the bank, because you think Donald Trump's going to end the economy,
    you're betting against AI. You're not betting against Donald Trump. You are literally
    betting against something which is compounding at a pace that most people can't

  topic: adoption/investment
- impact_reason: 'Pinpoints the necessary condition for a major Bitcoin move (short
    squeeze): a simultaneous drop in stocks, bonds, and the dollar, which the speaker
    believes is inevitable episodically.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is the most important point for Bitcoin this year, and this is where
    I think the short squeeze is going to occur. The correlation between the dollar
    and bonds is going to be critical in a second after the year. We've had a bounce
    in stocks. The dollar is barely budged, and rates have stayed higher. When you
    go through it, what was the problem this year? Stocks, bonds, and the currency
    went down at some point. That's going to happen again this year at some point.

    One is the economy has been completely apt, and now it's being AI. So the economy's

    their jobs to have a recession.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #1550 Jordi Visser | If You Miss This Bitcoin
  Run, Don’t Say You Weren’t Told


  This episode of the Pom Podcast features Anthony Pompliano in conversation with
  Jordi Visser, a 30-year veteran of Wall Street, focusing on the divergence between
  traditional economic narratives and the reality being shaped by technological shifts,
  particularly AI and Bitcoin. The central theme revolves around the advantage of
  intellectual humility and rejecting outdated frameworks when navigating the current,
  rapidly changing macro environment.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Macroeconomics, Investment Strategy, and the impact
  of Exponential Technology (AI and Bitcoin)**. Key topics included the current state
  of inflation and recession fears, the surprising resilience of the stock market
  despite bearish predictions, the politicalization of economic data, and the fundamental
  shift in investment behavior driven by retail investors and technological disruption.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **AI CapEx Accounting Arbitrage:** The massive capital expenditure (CapEx) into
  AI infrastructure (estimated at $300B) is currently recognized as revenue for semiconductor
  and hardware providers (like Nvidia) but is depreciated over 7-10 years as an expense
  for the spending companies (Mag 7). This creates a temporary, significant boost
  to aggregated S&P 500 profit margins that masks future long-term ROI challenges.

  *   **AI-Driven Code Replication:** AI tools are rapidly replicating code, threatening
  the bottom 80% of coding jobs. The speed at which new AI-native companies (like
  Cursor or Replit) are achieving significant Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) with
  minimal headcount (e.g., two people vs. 12,500 employees at a competitor) demonstrates
  a fundamental shift in business scalability.

  *   **Intellectual Humility as an Investment Edge:** Visser posits that the advantage
  held by Bitcoin proponents is their willingness to reject established, historical
  economic data frameworks because they recognize the world has fundamentally changed
  due to exponential technology (AI). This "not knowing" allows for better adaptation
  than those clinging to outdated models.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Rejection of Recession Narrative:** Visser strongly disagrees with predictions
  of a recession retest, arguing that the economy has fundamentally changed (driven
  by AI and contingent labor) and that policy decisions (the "Fed Put") will always
  prevent a deep, protracted downturn ("U-bottoms"). The market is currently experiencing
  an "I-bottom" (straight up recovery).

  *   **Retail Investor Dominance:** Retail investors are exhibiting a persistent,
  one-directional bid, buying dips aggressively, which contrasts sharply with institutional
  caution. This behavior, often dismissed by Wall Street, is proving to be the winning
  strategy in the current market structure.

  *   **AI Disruption and Competition Selection:** The aggressive competitive positioning
  of new AI companies (choosing to compete directly against giants like Google or
  established incumbents) signals high conviction and potential for massive disruption,
  suggesting that the market is underestimating the speed of this shift.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordi Visser:** Wall Street veteran whose perspective emphasizes looking past
  noise and adapting worldviews to exponential change.

  *   **Anthony Pompliano (Pom):** Host, driving the discussion on data skepticism
  and the role of retail investors.

  *   **Stanley Druckenmiller & Paul Tudor Jones:** Mentioned as respected figures
  whose bearish predictions were invalidated by recent positive policy shifts (tariff
  pauses) and market resilience.

  *   **Mag 7 (Magnificent Seven):** Central to the discussion regarding AI CapEx
  spending and future profitability concerns.

  *   **Figure Markets & Maple:** Sponsors mentioned for their services in crypto-backed
  lending and on-chain asset management, respectively.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The conversation highlighted the **politicalization of economic data**, citing the
  vast divergence in inflation expectations between political parties in surveys like
  the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index. Visser suggests that traditional data sources
  are becoming unreliable because they are filtered through political lenses, reinforcing
  the Bitcoin community''s tendency to distrust official metrics. The underlying macro
  policy remains the necessity of currency debasement to manage high debt levels,
  which is inherently bullish for scarce assets like Bitcoin.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward a future where **historical precedent is increasingly
  irrelevant** due to exponential technological growth (AI). Investment success will
  depend on intellectual humility, the ability to process information quickly (gaining
  "reps" like an online poker player), and recognizing that policy intervention (the
  Fed Put) ensures liquidity, favoring assets that benefit from currency debasement
  (Bitcoin). The disruption caused by AI-native startups will eventually challenge
  the dominance of the current tech giants.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto Investors, Macro Strategists, and Technology
  Sector Professionals** who need to reconcile traditional financial analysis with
  the disruptive forces of AI and the unique investment thesis underpinning Bitcoin.'
