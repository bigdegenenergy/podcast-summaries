    of transactions are being aborted or rejected. You can classify this as high-frequency

    events, which has made the community amazing. Everyone is mostly on the same page.
    There is not much noise; there's a little signal. Leadership in Solana is very
    effective; they tend to focus on the things that matter.

  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The entire thing is based on free markets. What I mean by that is the sidecar
    communicates with the validator because it's one of the same and says, 'Hey, how
    much block space can we potentially reserve?' Let's say 25% or 50%, it doesn't
    matter. The validator says, 'Okay, RICO here is 50%.'

  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There will be SOL involved; we know for sure what the ratio is, though we're
    not entirely sure yet. This is something we're looking into. For example, when
    you reserve some block space, will that be 50% SOL and 50% RICO? We're still hashing

    that are coming. The reason for that is really simple: those first principles
    I mentioned early on make sense. It''s what you have to do if you want to scale.'
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Explains why RICO remains valuable even if Solana improves, focusing
    on predictability and competitive advantage rather than just speed
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What if Solana solves all of the current problems it has and becomes even
    faster and better? The answer is no because what is the fundamental problem or
    need that we're solving? We know that it's the ability to predict ahead of time
    with a guarantee, but also to beat the market.

    infrastructure that could influence future L1 development
  relevance_score: 7
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Not all applications need access to a shared state at all times, so you can
    have optionality. Locality also matters, basically where you are in the world
    compared to where the computation happens. An outcome can't be guessed; it has
    to be guaranteed and predictable.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Clarifies the automated, scalable nature of block space reservation,
    making it accessible for high-frequency institutional use
  relevance_score: 7
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Keep in mind this is programmatic, so it's not like you log into a dashboard
    and say, 'Hey, I want to reserve this.' It's more like buying a train ticket.
    You can do this consistently throughout one block, multiple blocks, a particular
    sequence of blocks, etc.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Explains the granular block space marketplace that creates new revenue
    streams and predictability for applications
  relevance_score: 7
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We take that block space and split it up into many different tickets that
    the applications can buy from the marketplace. That can be six hours in advance,
    an hour in advance, or a minute in advance.
  topic: business

    guaranteed transaction processing
  relevance_score: 7

  text: The RICO node is a network of separate nodes in clusters spread across different
    regions of the world. It acts as the main brain behind all of this, enabling the
    marketplace and the different block space products or transaction types.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Explains why timing matters for infrastructure innovation and why
    Solana is ready for advanced primitives like RICO
  relevance_score: 7
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: When the stack matures, it reaches a certain state where you can start to
    optimize and bring in new novel primitives because you can't do that on a stack
    that is changing every day and has fundamental issues.

summary: '# Podcast Summary: Solana Gets Even Faster With Robin A. Nordnes


  ## Focus Area

  This episode focuses on **Solana blockchain infrastructure optimization**, specifically
  discussing RICO''s transaction infrastructure solutions for guaranteed block space
  reservation, pre-confirmations, and validator economics improvements.


  ## Key Technical Insights

  â¢ **Pre-confirmation Technology**: RICO enables sub-50 millisecond pre-confirmations
  (compared to Solana''s 400ms block time) through a distributed network of nodes
  that communicate with validators via sidecars compatible with Agave and Dancer clients

  â¢ **Block Space Reservation System**: RICO creates a marketplace where applications
  can reserve guaranteed block space up to 2 days in advance, eliminating the current
  75-90% transaction rejection rate during network congestion

  â¢ **Validator Integration Architecture**: The system uses sidecars that run alongside
  existing Solana clients, allowing validators to allocate portions of their block
  space (25-50%) to RICO''s reservation marketplace without disrupting normal operations


  ## Market/Investment Angle

  â¢ **$13.5M Funding Round**: Led by Pantera Capital, highlighting institutional confidence
  in Solana infrastructure improvements and the growing need for predictable transaction
  execution

  â¢ **Validator Revenue Enhancement**: RICO enables validators to diversify from single
  block space products to multiple revenue streams, potentially increasing the current
  5% MEV revenue share to 30%+ through specialized block space products

  â¢ **Institutional DeFi Enablement**: Addresses the critical need for predictable
  transaction execution that traditional finance institutions require before deploying
  capital-intensive strategies on-chain


  ## Notable Companies/People

  â¢ **RICO**: Founded by Robin A. Nordnes, positioning itself as critical Solana infrastructure
  for institutional adoption

  â¢ **Pantera Capital**: Lead investor demonstrating institutional backing for Solana
  scaling solutions

  â¢ **Solana Foundation & Superteam**: Provided early support and collaboration for
  RICO''s development

  â¢ **Jito Labs**: Referenced as current MEV solution provider that RICO aims to complement
  and expand upon


  ## Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  Limited regulatory discussion, though the conversation implies that guaranteed transaction
  execution and predictable block space access are prerequisites for traditional financial
  institutions to operate compliant strategies on-chain at scale.


  ## Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward **multi-tiered block space markets** where different
  applications pay different premiums for various levels of execution guarantees.
  This suggests a future where blockchain infrastructure becomes more specialized
  and service-oriented, similar to traditional cloud computing models, with validators
  evolving from simple block producers to differentiated service providers.


  ## Target Audience

  **Crypto/DeFi professionals, institutional investors, and Solana ecosystem participants**
  - particularly those involved in high-frequency trading, MEV strategies, or institutional
  DeFi deployment.

  ## Comprehensive Analysis


  This episode presents a deep dive into one of Solana''s most significant infrastructure
  challenges: transaction predictability and guaranteed execution. Robin A. Nordnes,
  founder of RICO, articulates a compelling vision for transforming Solana''s transaction
  infrastructure from a "hope for the best" model to a predictable, reservation-based
  system.


  The conversation reveals the fundamental tension in current blockchain architecture:
  while networks like Solana offer impressive throughput, they lack the execution
  guarantees that institutional users require. RICO''s solutionâa sidecar system that
  enables validators to pre-sell block space through a marketplaceârepresents a sophisticated
  approach to this problem. The technical implementation involves distributed RICO
  nodes that coordinate with validators to offer pre-confirmations in under 50 milliseconds,
  dramatically faster than Solana''s 400ms block time.


  Nordnes'' background provides crucial contextâhis eight years in Ethereum development
  and 2023 migration to Solana reflects broader industry sentiment about Ethereum''s
  scaling limitations. His decision to build on Solana was driven by four key principles:
  instantaneous information travel, optional shared state access, geographic locality
  considerations, and guaranteed rather than probabilistic outcomes.


  The economic model presents intriguing implications for Solana''s validator ecosystem.
  Currently, validators earn revenue through transaction fees (~65%), network issuance
  (~30%), and Jito tips (~5%). RICO proposes to expand this by enabling validators
  to sell differentiated block space products, potentially increasing MEV-related
  revenue from 5% to 30% while creating entirely new revenue streams through futures-like
  block space markets.


  The institutional use case is particularly compelling. Nordnes describes scenarios
  where hedge funds could reserve block space 30 minutes in advance based on algorithmic
  signals, providing the execution certainty that traditional finance demands. This
  addresses a critical barrier to institutional DeFi adoptionâthe inability to guarantee
  trade execution in volatile markets.


  The technical architecture avoids common pitfalls by maintaining full compatibility
  with existing Solana SDKs and not requiring changes to application development patterns.
  The sidecar approach allows gradual adoption without network-wide coordination,
  while the marketplace mechanism ensures fair price discovery for block space reservation.


  Looking forward, RICO''s success depends heavily on validator adoption, which hinges
  on economic incentives. The project''s timing appears strategic, coinciding with
  upcoming Solana improvements like multiple concurrent leaders and various validator
  economic proposals that could enhance RICO''s value proposition.


  The planned RICO token introduces additional complexity but appears necessary for
  coordinating the distributed network of RICO nodes. The tokenomics will likely blend
  SOL and RICO requirements, though specific ratios remain undetermined.


  This conversation matters because it addresses fundamental blockchain infrastructure
  limitations that constrain institutional adoption. If successful, RICO coul'
