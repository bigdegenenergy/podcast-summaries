summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: URGENT WW3: Should You Sell BITCOIN and Crypto?
  (ALTEASON CANCELLED)


  This 81-minute live stream focused intensely on the immediate impact of escalating
  geopolitical conflict in the Middle East (specifically between Israel and Iran)
  on the cryptocurrency markets, while simultaneously analyzing current technical
  setups for Bitcoin and altcoins. The host balances breaking news coverage with live
  trading commentary and sentiment analysis.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus was the **intersection of geopolitics (Middle East conflict escalation)
  and cryptocurrency investment strategy**. Key sub-topics included:

  *   Analyzing Bitcoin''s price action and liquidation levels amidst conflict news.

  *   Debating whether the anticipated "Alt Season" is canceled or merely delayed.

  *   Live technical analysis of Bitcoin ($BTC) and Solana ($SOL) charts.

  *   Discussion of broader macroeconomic factors (Fed delays, rising bond yields).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin Liquidation Targets:** The host was closely watching liquidation stacks,
  noting a significant selling block around **$105,550** and higher liquidations up
  to **$106,553**. A worst-case scenario, if the conflict fully escalates, suggested
  a drop to fill the CME futures gap near **$90,000 - $91,000**.

  *   **Solana Short Setup:** The host identified a potentially bearish setup on Solana,
  targeting a short entry near **$148** if the price moved up to test resistance.

  *   **Historical Precedent:** Reviewing past conflicts (Russia/Ukraine invasion,
  Oct 7th Hamas attack), the host noted that initial fear-driven pullbacks were often
  followed by significant upward price action in Bitcoin, suggesting current fear
  might be temporary.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Holding vs. Selling:** Despite the geopolitical tension, the host expressed
  a personal stance of **"I am not selling,"** aligning with bullish sentiment in
  the chat.

  *   **Alt Season Outlook:** While acknowledging that every time Ethereum nears a
  breakout, negative news intervenes, the host noted that many analysts still anticipate
  Alt Season within the next two months (July-September).

  *   **DeFi as a Strong Sector:** DeFi was highlighted as one of the best potential
  areas for investment given the current market conditions.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Netanyahu:** Mentioned regarding his aggressive stance and calls for regime
  change in Iran.

  *   **Charlie Kirk/Political Commentators:** Discussed as examples of paid political
  commentators spreading potentially coordinated narratives regarding sleeper cells
  and escalation risks.

  *   **Tars AI:** Briefly mentioned as a project the host has followed.

  *   **Fidelity:** Mentioned in the context of potential future ETFs, specifically
  noting the anticipation for a **Solana ETF (S1)**, which previously helped pump
  SOL.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion heavily criticized the role of **politicians** in escalating global
  conflicts, suggesting that retail investors are consistently hurt by decisions made
  by those financing or benefiting from war. There was no specific discussion of crypto
  regulation, but the broader theme was the negative impact of government policy (geopolitical
  and economic) on markets.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that the market is currently in a **"market maker''s game,"**
  where volatility is high, and retail investors must be cautious, especially entering
  the weekend with low volume. The host believes the conflict is likely to **escalate**
  over the next 5-12 days, but historical data suggests Bitcoin may ultimately absorb
  the shock and continue its upward trajectory, provided a direct attack on US soil
  does not occur.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **active cryptocurrency traders and investors**
  who need real-time analysis linking major global events to their portfolio decisions,
  particularly those focused on Bitcoin and high-cap altcoins like Solana.'
