    the data, and then apply algorithms to train models... But now people have been
    developing these new paradigms, which is along with LLMs foundation models. So
    the idea is that yes, you still care about the specific data you are working on,
    but at the same time, we want to collect all the available data, relevant data,
    or irrelevant data, but as long as they fall into the same domain, and fill those
    data into those transformer architectures to build a much large-scale pre-trained
    models.

  text: a way of phenomenon is about hallucination, right? So, when those models,
    AI models, they generate new outputs, they probably seemingly like answers. But
    if you delve into that... when it goes to the bio-medical biochemistry, etc. For
    example, it generates a new set of genes, a new molecule, is this something that
    you cannot be answered or validated instantly?

  text: Fine-tuning meaning yes, we take the foundation models but we can still take
    the data you have, right? So we can use the data you have to train to fine-tune
    the model, right? It's called fine-tune. It doesn't mean we retrain the whole,
    you know, the foundation model, large language model, etc. We just adjust the
    weights based on the data you have so that it can better be personalized for your
    problems having better prediction accuracy or relevancy to the study you have.

summary: '## Comprehensive Summary: Building AI-Ready Cultures in Life Sciences R&D


  This 30-minute podcast episode, featuring **Zhong Liu, Director of Data Science
  in AI at Novartis**, focuses on the paradigm shift in Life Sciences R&D driven by
  **Generative AI (GenAI)** and **Foundation Models (FMs)**, and the cultural and
  technical challenges associated with scaling these technologies beyond pilot projects.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the transition from traditional, task-specific Machine
  Learning (ML) to leveraging large-scale Foundation Models (FMs) in drug discovery,
  molecular design, and clinical protocol optimization. Key themes include the architectural
  shift in AI (from supervised learning to transformer-based FMs), the necessity of
  domain-specific fine-tuning, and the organizational alignment required to realize
  ROI from GenAI adoption in a highly regulated environment.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Shift to Foundation Models:** The core technical evolution is moving from
  training models solely on proprietary, labeled data to leveraging massive, pre-trained
  FMs (like LLMs) that capture broad domain knowledge. This allows for better performance
  even with small, specific datasets through **fine-tuning** (adjusting weights rather
  than retraining the entire model).

  *   **GenAI in Molecular Design:** FMs, built on transformer architectures, can
  process molecular representations (like SMILES strings or graphs) to generate novel
  molecules or cell types *in silico*. This generation can be constrained by desired
  properties (e.g., toxicity, solubility) simultaneously.

  *   **BERT vs. GPT Architectures:** The discussion distinguished between older models
  like BERT (focused on representation/embeddings) and newer GPT-like models (leveraging
  the decoder part of the transformer to generate novel sequences/data).


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Scaling Challenge:** Despite high investment (73% of life sciences leaders
  investing in GenAI), scaling beyond pilots remains difficult (fewer than 20% successful),
  highlighting a gap between experimentation and meaningful application.

  *   **Data Dependency vs. Model Power:** While FMs reduce the immediate need for
  massive proprietary datasets, the ultimate success in specialized areas (like specific
  disease pathways) still relies on high-quality, domain-specific data, which is often
  limited by current experimental throughput technologies.

  *   **ROI and Evaluation:** Measuring the Return on Investment (ROI) for AI-driven
  research is complex. Organizations must develop **domain-driven evaluation metrics
  and knowledge-checking benchmarks** to validate outputs (like generated molecules)
  that cannot be instantly verified, unlike text or code generation.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Zhong Liu (Novartis):** The featured expert, providing insights from the perspective
  of a major pharmaceutical company actively integrating AI into R&D.

  *   **Google (Transformer Architecture):** Mentioned as the originator of the foundational
  transformer architecture that underpins modern FMs.

  *   **Deloitte:** Cited for a recent survey highlighting the gap between GenAI investment
  and successful scaling in life sciences.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward **hybrid development models**, leveraging public FM
  advancements while building proprietary, domain-specific versions where necessary.
  The future success hinges not just on technological advancement but critically on
  **building AI-ready cultures** characterized by tight alignment and communication
  between AI modelers, basic scientists (SMEs), and leadership. The concept of using
  FMs against de-identified patient data to create functional **digital twins** for
  testing compounds is a significant future application.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI/Tech Professionals** working in or adjacent
  to the Life Sciences sector, **R&D Executives**, **Data Science Leaders**, and **Business
  Strategists** involved in guiding AI investment and transformation within pharmaceutical
  and biotech organizations.'
