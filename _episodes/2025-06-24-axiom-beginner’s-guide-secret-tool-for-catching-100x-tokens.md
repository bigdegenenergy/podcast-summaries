summary: '## Axiom Beginner’s Guide: Secret Tool for Catching 100x Tokens - Podcast
  Summary


  This 27-minute podcast episode serves as a comprehensive, step-by-step beginner''s
  guide to **Axiom**, a powerful, non-custodial DeFi trading terminal built primarily
  for the Solana ecosystem, though it also integrates with Arbitrum for derivatives.

  the review is impartial, focusing on Axiom''s utility in discovering and trading
  volatile assets like meme coins and accessing perpetual futures.

  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is a detailed walkthrough of the **Axiom DeFi Trading Terminal**,
  covering account setup, funding, token discovery tools (especially for Solana meme
  coins), advanced trading features (spot and perpetuals), wallet management, and
  integrated yield generation.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Non-Custodial Aggregation:** Axiom acts as a command center, connecting to
  various DEXs (like Pump Swap) and perpetual platforms (like Hyperliquid) without
  ever taking custody of the user''s crypto assets.

  *   **Cross-Chain Conversion:** The platform features a built-in "Convert" function
  to seamlessly swap assets between chains, specifically highlighted for converting
  SOL (on Solana) into USDC (on Arbitrum) for perpetuals trading.

  *   **Advanced Order & Protection:** The terminal supports standard market/limit
  orders alongside advanced options, including automated trades based on developer
  wallet actions and built-in MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) protection against front-running.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Meme Coin Discovery Focus:** Axiom is positioned as a tool to capitalize on
  the fast-moving Solana meme coin ecosystem by providing real-time data aggregation
  from sources like Pump.fun and Radium via its Discovery and Pulse pages.

  *   **Airdrop Potential:** Signing up via the provided link/QR code offers a 10%
  lifetime cashback and a **2x point multiplier**, suggesting that platform activity
  may qualify users for future token airdrops, similar to the lucrative Hyperliquid
  airdrop.

  *   **Risk Management Tools:** The platform provides deep transparency into token
  distribution (developer holdings, insider allocation) and allows users to track
  professional traders, which is crucial for navigating high-risk, high-reward micro-cap
  trading.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Axiom:** The central subject, co-founded by **Henry Zhang** and **Preston
  Ellis** (UC San Diego graduates).

  *   **Integrated Platforms:** **Pump Swap**, **Radium** (for spot trading on Solana),
  and **Hyperliquid** (for perpetual futures trading on Arbitrum).

  *   **Yield Provider:** The integrated yield feature is powered by the **Margin5
  protocol**, offering ~4% APY on USDC.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No specific regulatory discussions were held, but the non-custodial nature of Axiom
  is implicitly highlighted as a benefit, reducing counterparty risk associated with
  centralized exchanges. The discussion heavily focuses on *decentralized* trading
  mechanics.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a trend toward **highly integrated, multi-chain DeFi terminals**
  that aggregate data and execution across various specialized protocols (DEXs, derivatives
  platforms). The emphasis on wallet tracking and social sentiment integration points
  toward the future of on-chain trading being heavily reliant on sophisticated tooling
  that monitors "smart money" activity.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **intermediate to advanced crypto traders** focusing
  on the **Solana ecosystem**, particularly those interested in high-speed trading,
  meme coin hunting, and accessing decentralized perpetual futures markets. Beginners
  will benefit from the setup guide but may find the advanced discovery tools overwhelming
  initially.

  ### Comprehensive Narrative Summary


  The podcast begins by introducing Axiom as an essential, non-sponsored trading terminal
  for navigating the complex Solana DeFi landscape. Co-founded by UC San Diego graduates,
  Axiom aggregates trading across multiple DEXs (like Pump Swap) and derivatives platforms
  (Hyperliquid) without holding user funds.


  The guide meticulously details the **onboarding process**, stressing the importance
  of securing the unique recovery key provided upon wallet connection (Phantom wallet
  integration is demonstrated). A key incentive for new users is the **2x point multiplier**
  linked to the referral, hinting at future airdrop eligibility.


  **Funding and Asset Management** are covered next, noting that Axiom creates a separate
  wallet. Users can deposit SOL directly or purchase it via Coinbase integration (though
  higher fees are noted). A critical technical step is the **SOL to USDC (Arbitrum)
  conversion** required for trading perpetuals on Hyperliquid via Axiom.


  The core utility lies in the **Discovery and Pulse pages**. The Discovery page aggregates
  trending tokens from DEX screeners, highlighting metrics like liquidity and volume,
  while the Pulse page specifically tracks tokens newly launched on platforms like
  Pump.Fun, monitoring their age, developer allocation, and migration status to full
  DEXs. The host strongly cautions against trading these nascent tokens without deep
  research.


  The **Trading Terminal** section is the deepest dive, explaining how to analyze
  charts (with 1-second intervals), set up market/limit orders, and utilize advanced
  features like **MEV protection** and customizable transaction presets (slippage,
  priority fees). Crucially, Axiom integrates **on-chain intelligence**, allowing
  users to view token distribution metrics, track the trading history of top performers,
  and visualize wallet clustering.


  Finally, the guide explores **Portfolio Management** (consolidating small balances
  across multiple wallets), the **Yield Tab** (offering ~4% APY on USDC via Margin5),
  and the **Perpetuals Tab** for leveraged'
