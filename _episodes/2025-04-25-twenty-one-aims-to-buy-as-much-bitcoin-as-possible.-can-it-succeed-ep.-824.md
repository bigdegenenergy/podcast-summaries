summary: '## Podcast Summary: Twenty One Aims to Buy as Much Bitcoin as Possible.
  Can It Succeed? - Ep. 824


  This episode of Unchained, hosted by Laura Shin, features Matthew Siegel, Head of
  Digital Assets Research at VanEck, focusing heavily on the accelerating trend of
  public companies adopting a MicroStrategy-style Bitcoin accumulation strategy, highlighted
  by the launch of a new venture called **21**.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **corporate adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset**,
  specifically analyzing the new venture, **21**, formed by **Tether, SoftBank, and
  Cantor Fitzgerald''s affiliate**. The discussion delves into the mechanics, risks,
  and strategic implications of using corporate equity and debt structures to aggressively
  acquire Bitcoin, alongside the intersection of Bitcoin, AI infrastructure, and energy.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **The Bitcoin Yield Engine:** The core mechanism relies on these companies issuing
  equity or convertible debt while their stock trades at a **premium to their Net
  Asset Value (NAV)** based on Bitcoin holdings. This premium allows them to issue
  securities and buy more Bitcoin accretively, effectively generating a "Bitcoin yield."

  *   **Risk of Discount:** The strategy breaks down if the stock trades at a **discount**
  to its underlying Bitcoin value, as financing BTC via equity then becomes value-destructive
  for shareholders.

  *   **Structural Arbitrage:** Innovative financial instruments like convertible
  debt and preferred securities (as seen with MicroStrategy) attract different buyer
  classes (e.g., arbitrageurs, pension funds), widening the total addressable market
  for capital formation directed toward Bitcoin.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Accelerating Corporate Adoption:** Year-over-year Bitcoin accumulation by
  corporations has recently outpaced that of ETFs, with over 100 firms now following
  the model.

  *   **SoftBank as a Bellwether:** The involvement of SoftBank (a mega-cap tech stock)
  and Tether signals a significant institutional validation and entry point into the
  Bitcoin ecosystem in the US market.

  *   **Volatility and Risk:** These Bitcoin-heavy stocks are significantly more volatile
  than Bitcoin itself (often **twice as volatile**), posing substantial downside risk
  if the premium collapses during a bear market. Investors are advised to manage position
  sizing carefully.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **21:** The new entity aiming to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible, launching
  with 42,000 BTC ($3.9B).

  *   **SoftBank (Masayoshi Son):** A major participant, viewing Bitcoin through the
  lens of its intersection with AI infrastructure (via negotiations to back Stargate
  AI) and energy.

  *   **Tether:** Gaining a US regulatory foothold by holding a portion of its assets
  under the US nexus.

  *   **MicroStrategy (Michael Saylor):** The established blueprint for this corporate
  accumulation strategy, known for its retail-facing communication skills.

  *   **Jack Mallers (CEO of Strike):** Named CEO of 21, expected to leverage his
  retail communication skills, while the CFO, Steve Mehan (investment banker), will
  handle the capital markets execution.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   The discussion touched upon **geopolitical financial inflection points**, noting
  Tether''s role in exporting dollars and SoftBank''s low-cost funding advantage derived
  from Japan''s monetary policy.

  *   An example of regulatory friction was cited in **Japan**, where high-income
  earners face up to a **55% tax** on Bitcoin gains versus lower capital gains rates
  on securities, creating an arbitrage opportunity for companies structured to hold
  BTC.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The trend of corporate Bitcoin accumulation is expected to continue across different
  stock markets, driven by tax arbitrage and the desire to capture the equity premium.
  However, the proliferation of these "levered clones" raises concerns about potential
  systemic blow-ups if Bitcoin enters a prolonged downturn, as noted by Ryan Watkins.
  The conversation suggests a future where specialized financial products (like VanEck’s
  planned On-Chain Economy ETF) will emerge to help investors navigate and selectively
  invest in the winners within this category.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto and Traditional Finance Professionals, Institutional Investors, and Sophisticated
  Retail Investors.** This episode provides deep analysis on corporate finance strategies
  within the crypto space, making it valuable for those tracking institutional adoption,
  asset allocation, and market structure.'
