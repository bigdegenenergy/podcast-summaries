  text: Indirect prompt injection means that we effectively had different tools, systems,
    dashes, I'd call it a text stack that you can interface with. So think agentic
    systems, abilities to access files, emails, and that's actually how prompting

summary: '## Podcast Summary: #521: Red Teaming LLMs and GenAI with PyRIT


  This episode of Talk Python to Me features **Tory Westerhof** (Operations Lead for
  Microsoft''s AI Red Team) and **Roman Lutz** (Engineer on the AI Red Team tooling
  side) discussing the emerging field of AI security, specifically focusing on red
  teaming Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI (GenAI) systems. The core
  of the discussion revolves around identifying new attack surfaces created when LLMs
  are connected to tools and external data, and introducing **PyRIT** (Pythonic Red
  Teaming), an open-source framework developed by the Microsoft AI Red Team to automate
  and scale security testing.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **AI/ML Security and Red Teaming for LLMs and Agentic Systems**.
  Key technologies discussed include LLMs, prompt engineering/injection, agentic AI
  architectures, and the application of traditional security methodologies (like OWASP)
  to this new domain. The central tool discussed is **PyRIT**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **The New Attack Surface:** Connecting LLMs to tools, APIs, and untrusted external
  data (like documents or emails) creates a fundamentally new and complex attack surface,
  moving beyond traditional application security boundaries.

  *   **Indirect Prompt Injection as the Evolving Threat:** While direct prompt injection
  is the "bread and butter," **indirect prompt injection** (where malicious instructions
  are hidden in ingested data, like an email or spreadsheet) is seen as the most rapidly
  evolving and difficult-to-test vector as AI systems become more integrated (agentic).

  *   **PyRIT''s Role in Scaling Security:** PyRIT is designed to automate the tedious
  aspects of red teaming, allowing security teams to test defenses against a vast
  and evolving set of adversarial prompts and scenarios, turning security from a one-time
  audit into an everyday engineering practice.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Mismatch in AI Project Success:** The high reported failure rate of AI projects
  (cited at 95%) might stem from unrealistic expectations (e.g., trying to replace
  entire call centers) rather than failures in internal developer tooling, where agentic
  AI is already proving highly beneficial for productivity.

  *   **Security as a Prerequisite for Adoption:** For broader, user-facing AI adoption
  to succeed, robust safety and security measures must be prioritized. Security is
  the necessary foundation for realizing the benefits of agentic systems.

  *   **The Value of Security-Minded Talent:** The speakers humorously noted that
  candidates who demonstrate clever indirect prompt injection techniques in their
  resumes might actually be highly desirable for their adversarial thinking, highlighting
  the need for security-aware engineering talent in this space.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Microsoft AI Red Team:** The organization responsible for pioneering these
  testing methodologies and developing PyRIT.

  *   **Tory Westerhof & Roman Lutz:** Guests and key contributors to the Microsoft
  AI Red Team, focusing on testing high-risk GenAI systems and building the necessary
  tooling, respectively.

  *   **OWASP:** Mentioned for establishing the **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications
  and Generative AI Vulnerabilities**, providing a foundational framework for understanding
  risks like prompt injection.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is rapidly moving toward highly integrated, **agentic systems** that
  interact with complex data sources and tools. This necessitates a shift in security
  thinking:

  1.  **Continuous Testing:** Security must be integrated throughout the development
  lifecycle (Shift Left), moving away from post-deployment audits.

  2.  **Interdisciplinary Expertise:** Effective red teaming requires input from diverse
  fields, including traditional cybersecurity, law, and domain expertise, to model
  complex harms.

  3.  **Defining Agency Boundaries:** Future work will focus heavily on taxonomy and
  control mechanisms to prevent "excessive agency"—where agents operate without sufficient
  human-in-the-loop oversight or possess autonomous capabilities deemed too high-risk.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI/ML Engineers, Security Professionals (DevSecOps,
  Red Teamers), Software Architects, and Technology Leaders** responsible for deploying
  LLM-powered applications into production environments.'
