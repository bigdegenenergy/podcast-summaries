summary: '## Summary of Super Data Science Podcast Episode 890: State of AI in 2025


  This episode of the Super Data Science Podcast, hosted by John Crone, provides a
  rapid-fire analysis of the five most critical takeaways from the recently published
  2025 edition of the Stanford University Institute for Human-Centered AI’s AI Index
  Report. The discussion highlights dramatic technical advancements, significant cost
  reductions, emerging agent capabilities, soaring business adoption, and shifting
  global investment landscapes.


  ### Key Takeaways for Technology Professionals:


  **1. Extreme Efficiency Gains in Model Size:**

  The most striking technical trend is the massive reduction in model size required
  to achieve equivalent performance. The benchmark used is the MMLU score (above 60%).
  In 2022, Google’s PaLM (540B parameters) was needed; by 2024, Microsoft’s Phi-3
  Mini achieved the same result with only 3.8B parameters. This represents a **142-fold
  reduction in model size** over two years, meaning capabilities are now accessible
  with models 1% the size of their predecessors.


  **2. Dramatic Cost Deflation in LLM Inference:**

  The operational cost of running large language models has plummeted. The cost to
  query a model with GPT-3.5 equivalent performance (65% MMLU accuracy) dropped from
  approximately **$20 per million tokens in late 2022 to just $0.7 per million tokens
  by late 2024** (citing Gemini 1.5 Flash 8B). This 280-fold cost reduction in under
  two years makes high-volume AI deployment significantly more feasible for businesses.


  **3. Maturation and Superiority of AI Agents:**

  AI agents are demonstrating powerful capabilities, particularly in short-horizon
  tasks. Using the new REBench benchmark, top AI systems now score **four times better
  than human experts** on complex tasks completed within two hours or less. While
  humans still lead in tasks requiring longer timeframes (e.g., 32 hours), AI agents
  are already matching or exceeding human expertise in specific complex areas like
  certain types of code generation, delivering results faster.


  **4. Explosive Organizational AI Adoption:**

  The combination of better, cheaper models has fueled rapid enterprise integration.
  Organizational AI adoption across companies rose from **55% in 2023 to 78% in 2024**.
  Furthermore, the use of Generative AI specifically within business functions surged
  from 38% to **71%** in the same period, indicating a shift from experimentation
  to widespread functional deployment.


  **5. Shifting Global Private Investment Landscape:**

  Private investment in AI reached new peaks globally in 2024, driven heavily by the
  US. The US recorded **$109 billion in private AI investment**, surpassing the previous
  2021 peak. Europe also saw record investment ($19 billion), though it remains less
  than a fifth of US levels. Crucially, **China bucked the trend**, with its private
  AI investment decreasing annually since its 2021 peak, falling to just $9 billion
  in 2024—less than half of European investment.


  ### Strategic Implications and Context:


  This conversation underscores a critical inflection point: AI is moving from a research
  curiosity to a highly efficient, cost-effective, and deeply integrated enterprise
  utility. For technology professionals, the key implication is the necessity of optimizing
  for smaller, highly capable models (efficiency) and rapidly integrating autonomous
  agents into workflows to capture productivity gains. The investment data suggests
  a significant concentration of AI innovation and capital in the US market, while
  the divergence in Chinese investment warrants strategic attention regarding global
  technology supply chains and competition.'
