summary: '## Podcast Summary: Where to Find the Next 100x Token: Top Launchpads 2025


  This 18-minute podcast episode from Coin Bureau, hosted by Guy, focuses on identifying
  the most effective platforms—crypto launchpads—for early investment in promising
  new tokens, specifically highlighting those that facilitate rapid gains (the "next
  100x"). The core narrative centers on the evolution from older Initial Coin Offerings
  (ICOs) to modern Initial DEX Offerings (IDIOs) and the rise of specialized, often
  meme-coin-focused, launchpads on the Solana ecosystem.


  The episode provides an in-depth review of five leading launchpads, emphasizing
  their unique mechanisms, fee structures, and user accessibility, while also promoting
  **Axiom** as a centralized trading terminal to access multiple launchpads simultaneously.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area:**

  The primary focus is on **Crypto Launchpads** within the **Solana ecosystem**, specifically
  platforms facilitating **Initial DEX Offerings (IDIOs)** and **meme coin launches**.
  Secondary focus includes decentralized trading infrastructure and advanced trading
  tools.


  **2. Key Technical Insights:**

  *   **Bonding Curve Model:** Several platforms (Pump.fun, Let''sBunk) utilize dynamic
  bonding curves to adjust token prices based on demand, often incorporating burn
  mechanisms to manage supply and incentivize early holding.

  *   **Instant DEX Liquidity:** Let''sBunk distinguishes itself by immediately integrating
  launched tokens into Raydium liquidity pools and routing them via Jupiter, ensuring
  instant DEX accessibility, unlike platforms that require a separate "graduation"
  step.

  *   **Web2 Integration for Token Creation:** Believe app introduced a novel method
  where tokens can be launched simply by posting a tagged tweet on X, with the backend
  detecting engagement thresholds before deployment on Solana.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle:**

  *   **IDIO Dominance:** IDIOs are confirmed as the dominant and more democratized
  method for early-stage token investing compared to traditional ICOs, which have
  fallen out of favor.

  *   **Revenue Generation:** Launchpads are proving to be massive revenue generators;
  Pump.fun generated over $700 million in total revenue at one point, and Let''sBunk
  surpassed Pump.fun in daily revenue by early July.

  *   **Accessibility vs. Advanced Tools:** There is a clear trade-off: platforms
  like Moonshot offer extreme simplicity (mobile creation, Apple/Google Pay integration)
  but lack advanced charting tools, pushing professional traders toward aggregated
  terminals like Axiom.


  **4. Notable Companies/People:**

  *   **Axiom:** Highlighted as a crucial decentralized trading terminal aggregating
  top DEXs and launchpads, offering advanced features like TradingView charts and
  sniper detection.

  *   **Pump.fun:** Founded by Noah Tweedell, Alan Cohen, and Dylan Kerler; the original
  Solana meme coin launchpad using a standardized, rug-proof launch model.

  *   **Let''sBunk.fun:** Developed by BunkMemecoin enthusiasts, led by Soulport Tom;
  notable for its revenue distribution model benefiting the Bunk ecosystem.

  *   **Believe App (formerly Cloud.me):** Founded by Ben Pastenak; targets Web2 developers
  and focuses on utility tokens, integrating with Meteora post-graduation.

  *   **Moonshot:** A mobile-first app majority-acquired by **Jupiter** (Solana’s
  largest DEX); offers extremely simple token creation via mobile.

  *   **Raydium Launch Lab:** Created by key Raydium team members (AlphaRay, X-Ray,
  GammaRay) in direct response to Pump.fun ditching Raydium for its own DEX.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  No explicit discussion of formal regulatory frameworks (SEC, etc.) occurred. The
  focus was on **internal project governance and security mechanisms** (e.g., Pump.fun’s
  standardized rug-proof rules, no pre-sales/team allocations) designed to protect
  retail investors from common crypto scams.


  **6. Future Implications:**

  The industry is heading toward hyper-specialized, highly accessible token creation
  tools, often integrated directly into social media (Believe) or mobile apps (Moonshot).
  The competition between launchpads is fierce, driving innovation in liquidity provision
  (Let''sBunk) and user experience. The success of these platforms suggests that **Solana
  remains the dominant chain for rapid, high-volume token launches.**


  **7. Target Audience:**

  This episode is most valuable for **Active Crypto Traders, DeFi Investors, and Web3
  Analysts** seeking actionable intelligence on where early capital is flowing and
  which platforms offer the best entry points for high-risk, high-reward token investments.
