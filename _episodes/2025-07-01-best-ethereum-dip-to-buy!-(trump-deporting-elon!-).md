    or $105,000, saving with Ethereum, $2520, you know, $2390, whatever the range
    is, we just take advantage of those ranges as we go back and forth.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: BEST Ethereum DIP TO BUY! (TRUMP DEPORTING ELON!?)


  This 60-minute episode of *Discover Crypto* focuses heavily on technical analysis
  for trading Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC), underpinned by major institutional
  developments and macroeconomic uncertainty. The hosts provide actionable trading
  strategies while discussing the long-term bullish case for Ethereum, particularly
  in light of recent financial innovations.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**: Cryptocurrency Trading and Investment Strategy, with a strong
  emphasis on Ethereum''s technical setup, institutional adoption, and market structure
  analysis. Secondary topics included political speculation (Trump/Elon) and macroeconomic
  events (Powell speeches, potential rate cuts).


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Liquidation Hunting**: The hosts advocate for waiting for "liquidation sweeps"
  (price dips below recent lows) to enter trades, specifically targeting the wiping
  out of liquidity around **$2419** for ETH before entering a long position.

  *   **Power of Three (AMD Model)**: They detail the Accumulation, Manipulation,
  Distribution (AMD) framework, suggesting ETH has completed the manipulation phase
  (downside wick) and is entering the aggressive **Distribution phase**, targeting
  **$5,000+**.

  *   **Bull Flag Targets**: Technical patterns, specifically bull flags on the 3-day
  chart, align with a price target of **$5,000–$5,200** for Ethereum.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **ETH Institutional Thesis**: The core investment thesis revolves around Ethereum
  becoming the foundational layer for tokenized assets and stablecoins, necessitating
  institutional staking for network security.

  *   **Compounding Small Wins**: The hosts stress patience, advocating for compounding
  small, consistent daily gains (e.g., 2% daily) rather than "chasing" trends, which
  leads to being "erased."

  *   **Altcoin ETF Approval Odds**: The probability of **Altcoin ETFs** being approved
  has reportedly "skyrocketed to 95%," signaling major upcoming capital inflows into
  specific altcoins.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Thomas Lee (Funstrat CIO)**: Highlighted for his bullish thesis on ETH, specifically
  noting his firm is creating an **Ethereum Treasury vehicle** to accumulate and stake
  ETH, anticipating banks (like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan) will need to secure their
  stablecoins built on Ethereum by staking ETH.

  *   **Elon Musk/Donald Trump**: Mentioned in the title regarding speculative political
  drama, which the hosts noted caused recent market volatility (tariffs, bankruptcy
  comments).

  *   **BlackRock/Larry Fink**: Referenced as key figures signaling the institutional
  embrace of digital assets.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   **Altcoin ETF News**: The primary regulatory focus was the significantly increased
  odds (95%) for altcoin ETF approvals, suggesting a major regulatory shift is imminent.

  *   **Macro Events**: The hosts noted upcoming volatility tied to **Jerome Powell''s
  speeches** and the **FOMC meeting** at the end of July, which could influence rate
  cuts anticipated around September.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  The conversation strongly suggests that the industry is entering a phase of massive
  institutional integration, driven by the tokenization of traditional finance (TradFi)
  assets on Ethereum. The hosts believe the current market phase is still "Round One,"
  comparing it to the early days of Facebook opening up beyond college campuses. They
  predict a significant, potentially vertical, rally for ETH leading into potential
  rate cuts in September, kicking off a broader "alt season blow-off top."


  **7. Target Audience**: Experienced crypto traders, active swing traders, and investors
  focused on technical analysis, institutional adoption trends, and short-to-medium-term
  price targets for Bitcoin and Ethereum.'
