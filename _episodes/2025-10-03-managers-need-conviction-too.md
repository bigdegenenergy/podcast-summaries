summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - New managers often neglect to define their own true beliefs regarding their role
    and tasks.
  - Many managers adopt a 'soldier' mentality, focusing only on executing received
    orders.
  - A manager's personal conviction is crucial for the success of any project they
    lead.
  - Middle managers, who often inherit visions they didn't create, must still internalize
    and believe in them.
  - If a manager does not feel good about a project, its likelihood of success is
    low.
  - Lacking personal belief makes it difficult to communicate the 'magic' or purpose
    of a project to subordinates.
  - Authentic belief is necessary to effectively hold and communicate organizational
    vision and purpose.
  overview: New managers often fail to establish their own conviction, instead defaulting
    to simply executing orders as if they were soldiers. This lack of genuine belief
    significantly hinders project success because it makes it nearly impossible for
    managers to inspire their teams or effectively champion the vision. Managers must
    check in with themselves to ensure they genuinely support the mission they are
    tasked with executing.
