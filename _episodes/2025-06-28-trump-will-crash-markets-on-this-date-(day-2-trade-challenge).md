    he started with a set amount of capital in certain cryptos and made a ton of profit.
    For example, you can see Plume down here where he started with $455. He then took
    that $455, put it into the Plume portal here on Uniswap. Then in his cabin...
    he has now turned that $455 of Plume into roughly $4,300.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Trump Will Crash Markets On This Date (Day 2
  Trade Challenge)


  This 6-minute podcast segment focuses heavily on the host''s real-time cryptocurrency
  trading activities as part of a "$1,000 to $10,000 (and eventually a Porsche)" challenge,
  interspersed with commentary on macroeconomic events, particularly the potential
  impact of former President Trump''s trade policies.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**: Cryptocurrency Trading (specifically ETH futures/perpetuals),
  Technical Analysis (TA), and Macroeconomic Policy (US Tariffs and Federal Reserve
  interest rates).


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Liquidation Sweeps and Divergence**: The host successfully executed an ETH
  long trade based on identifying liquidations (using FOMO.IO) and observing a bullish
  divergence (price falling while indicators rise), leading to a predicted "snap"
  upward.

  *   **Entry/Exit Strategy**: Trades are managed using strict stop-loss adjustments
  to lock in profits (e.g., adjusting stop loss to 4.16% profit after an initial gain).
  Entries are often planned around anticipated liquidity sweeps below key support/resistance
  levels.

  *   **Market Structure**: The host emphasizes waiting for a "liquidation sweep"
  or a "change of character" before entering a new trade, indicating a preference
  for trading confirmed market structure breaks rather than trading within consolidation
  zones ("stuck between two major areas").


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Trump Tariffs and Inflation**: The primary macroeconomic concern is the July
  8th deadline for the 90-day extension of Trump''s tariffs. The market anticipates
  that the continuation or extension of these tariffs could reignite inflation, causing
  the Federal Reserve (Jerome Powell) to delay interest rate cuts.

  *   **Altcoin Season Caution**: Citing external analysis (Benjamin Cowan), the host
  notes a bearish sentiment where "altcoins could drop another 30%" despite the SPX
  hitting all-time highs, suggesting a rotation or consolidation phase.

  *   **Trading Challenge Metrics**: The host tracks daily ROI (achieving 4% ROI on
  one trade, totaling 20% completion of the $1k to $10k goal) while acknowledging
  the necessity of both wins and losses in compounding strategies.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **FOMO.IO**: Mentioned as the tool used to identify liquidations for trade entries.

  *   **JP Morgan**: Launching a USD-backed deposit token on the Base network, which
  the host suggests is bullish for **AeroDrome**.

  *   **Donald Trump**: Central to the macroeconomic discussion regarding upcoming
  tariff decisions.

  *   **Jerome Powell**: Mentioned as waiting on tariff outcomes before making decisions
  on interest rate reductions.

  *   **Veteran Crypto**: A guest/Discord member featured for demonstrating a successful
  DeFi yield farming strategy (turning $455 of Plume into ~$4,300 via the Plume portal
  on Uniswap).


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   **Deploying American Blockchains Act 2025**: The host expresses extreme excitement
  over the US House passing this act, which mandates the US government to deploy and
  promote blockchain and DLT technology. This is framed as a major, positive regulatory
  shift.

  *   **Trump''s Stance**: Trump recently called for Jerome Powell to resign, adding
  political volatility to the monetary policy outlook.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  *   If tariff extensions are delayed (due to ongoing good-faith negotiations), the
  market is expected to see an "upside moving into the latter half of July."

  *   The success of the trading challenge hinges on consistent compounding, even
  if daily targets (2% per day) are missed, emphasizing the power of long-term compounding
  over short-term perfection.


  **7. Target Audience**: Experienced crypto traders familiar with technical analysis
  (liquidations, divergences, MACD/RSI), DeFi yield strategies, and those interested
  in the intersection of US political events (tariffs) and crypto market movements.'
