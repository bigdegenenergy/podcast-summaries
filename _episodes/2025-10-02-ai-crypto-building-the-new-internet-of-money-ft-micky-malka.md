summary: '# AI + Crypto: Building the New Internet of Money ft. Micky Malka - Podcast
  Summary


  ## 1. Crypto Focus Area

  The episode explores the convergence of AI and crypto infrastructure, with emphasis
  on tokenization as a broader concept beyond traditional crypto assets. Discussion
  centers on how blockchain technology serves as foundational infrastructure for the
  new digital economy, moving beyond simple payment rails to become a general ledger
  system for all digital interactions.


  ## 2. Key Technical Insights

  • **Infrastructure Convergence**: Malka predicts crypto and FinTech will merge into
  unified infrastructure, eliminating the distinction between traditional and blockchain-based
  financial services

  • **Tokenization Evolution**: Beyond crypto tokens, the concept extends to "packets
  of information" that will power the new digital age, representing ownership and
  value transfer mechanisms

  • **Custody Innovation**: Discussion of MPC (Multi-Party Computation) decentralized
  custody as a solution to single-entity custody risks


  ## 3. Market/Investment Angle

  • **FinTech Maturation**: Malka declared "FinTech is dead (2011-2022)" in 2022,
  suggesting the major opportunities from that era are closed, with 25-30 companies
  set to dominate

  • **Early-Stage Advantage**: Success comes from solving problems you''ve personally
  experienced rather than following trends

  • **Generational Shift**: Millennials represent a permanently financialized generation
  with different expectations about money ownership and control


  ## 4. Notable Crypto Projects/People

  • **Coinbase**: Early investment based on infrastructure needs Malka experienced
  buying/storing Bitcoin

  • **Wences Casares**: Long-time business partner and crypto pioneer mentioned as
  close collaborator

  • **Vitalik Buterin**: Referenced for early work on colored coins and Ethereum development

  • **Ribbit Capital**: Malka''s firm known for prescient FinTech/crypto investments


  ## 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  Limited regulatory discussion, though Malka''s Venezuelan background provides perspective
  on hyperinflation, capital controls, and banking system failures that inform his
  crypto thesis.


  ## 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests crypto/Web3 is evolving toward invisible infrastructure
  that powers all digital interactions. AI and crypto will converge to create new
  forms of value transfer and ownership representation, with successful companies
  being those that solve real user pain points rather than following hype cycles.


  ## 7. Target Audience

  Most valuable for **institutional investors** and **strategic thinkers** in crypto
  who need to understand long-term infrastructure trends rather than short-term trading
  opportunities.

  ## Comprehensive Analysis


  This podcast represents a masterclass in understanding the intersection of traditional
  finance, crypto, and emerging AI technologies through the lens of one of FinTech''s
  most successful investors. Micky Malka''s journey from Venezuela to Silicon Valley
  provides crucial context for his investment philosophy and crypto thesis.


  **The Venezuelan Foundation**: Malka''s formative experience with hyperinflation,
  currency devaluations, and banking system collapses in 1980s-90s Venezuela created
  an intuitive understanding of monetary systems'' fragility. This background proved
  invaluable when evaluating Bitcoin in 2010, as he could immediately grasp its value
  proposition in ways that investors from stable monetary environments might miss.


  **Investment Philosophy Evolution**: The conversation reveals Malka''s methodology
  of investing in solutions to problems he''s personally encountered. His early Bitcoin
  purchases led to custody challenges, spurring investments in companies like Coinbase.
  This approach of "scratching your own itch" proved remarkably prescient across multiple
  investment cycles.


  **The FinTech Maturation Thesis**: Perhaps most significantly, Malka''s declaration
  that "FinTech is dead" represents a crucial inflection point. He argues that the
  macro conditions that enabled the 2011-2022 FinTech boom—mobile adoption, App Store
  distribution, post-financial crisis brand distrust, and unstructured data availability—have
  normalized. The window for new entrants has largely closed, with 25-30 companies
  positioned to dominate the next decade.


  **Convergence Prediction**: The podcast''s central thesis involves the inevitable
  merger of crypto and traditional FinTech infrastructure. Malka predicted in 2018-2019
  that these would converge into unified systems, eliminating artificial distinctions
  between "crypto" and "traditional" financial services.


  **Generational Transformation**: The Robinhood investment story illustrates a fundamental
  shift in how younger generations view money ownership. Unlike previous generations
  who accepted banks as money custodians, millennials and Gen Z expect direct control
  over their financial assets—a mindset that naturally aligns with crypto''s self-custody
  principles.


  **AI Integration Implications**: While the transcript cuts off before deep AI discussion,
  the setup suggests Malka views AI as the next convergence layer, potentially automating
  and optimizing the financial infrastructure that crypto and FinTech have been building.


  **Design and Taste**: Malka emphasizes the importance of design thinking and user
  experience in successful financial products, noting that technical capability alone
  isn''t sufficient—companies must also demonstrate aesthetic sensibility and user
  empathy.


  This conversation matters because it provides a rare long-term perspective from
  someone who has successfully navigated multiple technology and financial cycles.
  Malka''s track record with Coinbase, Robinhood, Revolut, and other major platforms
  lends credibility to his predictions about infrastructure convergence and the maturation
  of the crypto/Fin'
