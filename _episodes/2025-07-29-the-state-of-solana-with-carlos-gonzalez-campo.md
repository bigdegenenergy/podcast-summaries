    framing it as a foundational change for Solana's L1 capabilities.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Jito's B.A.M.... is probably one of the most consequential upgrades to Solana's
    transaction architecture ever.
  topic: Technology/Innovation
- impact_reason: Provides a concise, high-level technical explanation of B.A.M., focusing
    on the use of TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments) to enable privacy and secure
    block building.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: B.A.M. is just a new transaction processing engine. It uses an encrypted mempool
    inside of a TEE, and so what it offers is block building for Solana that is private
    and very viable.
  topic: Technology/Innovation
- impact_reason: Explains the power of B.A.M.'s 'plugins' feature, drawing an analogy
    to Uniswap hooks, indicating a massive expansion of programmable capabilities
    at the block-building layer.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Applications that were previously impossible on Solana are now possible by
    improving the microstructure and the design space via plugins, which are kind
    of like—if you look at Uniswap before, they have these hooks architecture—it's
    kind of like that but for block building.
  topic: Technology/Innovation
- impact_reason: Gives a direct use case (enabling sophisticated perpetuals/order
    books like Drift) that B.A.M. unlocks by solving complex sequencing and prioritization
    issues.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So imagine Drift implementing a plugin for priority, ten priority pricing,
    for market makers, right? So you kind of remove this huge barrier that you previously
    had, and now perps are now possible on Solana, or order books are possible on-chain.
  topic: DeFi/Technology
- impact_reason: 'A major strategic implication: B.A.M. might invalidate the need
    for many recently launched, dedicated Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) L2s/sidechains,
    as the L1 can now support their core features.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Over the past few months, you've seen a lot of Solana-native teams get frustrated
    and launch their SVM chains. I'm thinking about, for instance, the Ellipsis Labs
    team launching Las as an L2... if now it is possible to actually do this on the
    L1, then these kinds of SVM chains lose their edge, their differentiation factor.
  topic: Strategy/Scalability
- impact_reason: Describes a novel, technical solution (using TEEs) to mitigate MEV
    extraction by obscuring transaction bundles before they hit the public mempool,
    a key innovation in blockchain security/fairness.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think B.A.M. takes a more interesting approach... you have these TEEs, which
    is sort of an off-chain secure computing environment that allows the B.A.M. nodes
    to not leak transactions, and so you don't see what's going to be in the Jito
    bundle... until they've already made it to the blockchain. And so this just allows
    less time for sandwiching validators to see transactions, which is kind of the
    whole ballgame.
  topic: Technology/DeFi
- impact_reason: Details the accountability mechanism of B.A.M., which uses cryptographic
    attestations and public visibility to enforce transaction ordering, blending technical
    security with social accountability.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: These B.A.M. nodes sign an attestation when they schedule a transaction and
    send it to the validator. They also sign an attestation, and that attestation
    goes to the entire Solana network for everyone to see with the ordering of transactions.
    So if the validator that includes that block did not follow that ordering of transactions,
    then everyone is going to know that they committed potentially a sandwiching attack.
    So it's kind of this social pressure for validators to actually sequence transactions
    in the way that B.A.M. nodes transmit those messages or bundles...
  topic: Technology/Strategy
- impact_reason: Shifts the focus from raw throughput (block size) to latency (block
    time), suggesting that MEV mitigation (B.A.M.) is a prerequisite for achieving
    sub-400ms block times.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: People talk about doubling block space, but I'm more excited actually about
    reducing latency and eventually decreasing block times below 400 milliseconds.
    And without B.A.M., I think that's something you can realistically target in the
    next months after all the B.A.M. goes live.
  topic: Technology
- impact_reason: Highlights a major upcoming protocol upgrade (Alpen Glow) that promises
    a 100x improvement in time-to-finality, addressing a core criticism of Solana's
    optimistic confirmation model.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Alpen Glow reduces the time to finality a lot, so the time—because you have
    the optimistic confirmations basically on Solana currently—but with Alpen Glow,
    stuff is actually finally confirmed on the network 100x quicker is the number
    that gets thrown around.
  topic: Technology
- impact_reason: 'Articulates the core thesis for accepting higher validator centralization:
    performance gains are necessary to unlock the vision of global, accessible internet
    capital markets.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If the point of Solana is to create these internet capital markets... where
    anyone can get access to and verify financial services that are happening on blockchain
    rails instead of traditional financial rails... But that's only unlocked through
    a world where there are a couple hundred Solana validators, and they're all run
    by the Coinbases and the Galaxies and the Temporal of the world... Maybe that
    trade-off is worth it to you if that's what it's going to take.

  text: Soul has been almost only up since the pump ICO. And I think in retrospect,
    it kind of makes sense. You kind of saw this pivotal moment in Soul's history
    where it outperformed centralized exchanges during that moment, and it signaled
    how good it has become from a fundamental perspective.

    maturity gap and liquidity concentration in established Ethereum DeFi protocols
    (Aave) versus Solana's leading counterparts.
  relevance_score: 9

  text: Aave has more than $50 billion in assets. I was seeing some statistic the
    other day, it places it in the top 20 banks or something in the US if you were
    to rank it by deposits, whereas on Solana, you have Kamino as the largest one
    with like $4 billion or something. So it's still like one-tenth, even less than
    what the largest money market on Ethereum is.

  topic: DeFi/RWA
- impact_reason: A crucial insight into the drivers of stablecoin migration, suggesting
    that speculative/meme activity, rather than utility, often dictates short-term
    on-chain supply shifts.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Solana saw tremendous growth in its USDC supply suddenly in June, which is
    not because it suddenly became so much more useful for real-world activities;
    it's because the Trump meme coin was paired with USDC, and so a bunch of people
    bridged USDC onto the chain.
  topic: Adoption/Investment
- impact_reason: Poses a critical question regarding the sustainability of Solana's
    valuation when its primary demand metric (REV) declines, linking on-chain activity
    directly to investor sentiment.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: REV on Solana is unmistakably lower than it has been in some time... Is that
    a reason for concern if you're a Solana investor, or do you see this as kind of
    a short-term blip?
  topic: Investment/Market Analysis
- impact_reason: Challenges the recent SOL price action by contrasting it with the
    declining REV metric, suggesting a decoupling of price from measured network usage.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It's concerning in the sense that you kind of had this narrative that the
    SOL price was driven by REV, and now REV is down. So how can you justify the price
    going up if you were solely valuing based on that?
  topic: Investment/Market Analysis
- impact_reason: Explains that high REV is often correlated with speculative trading
    urgency (meme coins, rapid DeFi interactions) rather than sustained utility, explaining
    why REV drops when speculation cools.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Most REV comes from just pump, pump, let's bond that on Axiom, Phantom, this
    kind of trading-focused application. And if you have a decrease in that sort of

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: With plugins, you can do basically anything you want with your sequencing
    of transactions or any cool experiments you want to run. You can do it now, which
    is cool because it's opening up a competitive landscape for applications to come
    in and just experiment with plugins to see which one delivers the best results.

  text: My understanding is you have these TEEs, which is sort of an off-chain secure
    computing environment that allows the B.A.M. nodes to not leak transactions, and
    so you don't see what's going to be in the Jito bundle... until they've already
    made it to the blockchain.

    (sandwich attacks) on public blockchains and the limitations of purely social/reputational
    blacklisting mechanisms.

  text: Solana Foundation and Jito took steps to identify people who were sandwich
    attacking users... and just tried to blacklist them, wouldn't allow them into
    the stake pool, wouldn't give them a delegation of the Solana Foundation stake.
    But obviously, in crypto, you can always spin up a new validator node under a
    different identity and just get right back to sandwiching. So it was always kind
    of a whack-a-mole game and a difficult problem.

    directly to reduced profitability for extractive MEV actors, suggesting technical
    scaling can inherently improve user fairness.

  text: Solana sandwich attacking revenue has actually decreased over time because
    as the Solana network gets more efficient, there's less need to spray a transaction
    super wildly, and so fewer validators are seeing each transaction on average,
    and there's less opportunity to basically see a lot of order flow and try to find
    orders that you can sandwich attack.

  text: I did a piece on this kind of interesting slow validator problem on Solana,
    where through a meta that Firedancer maybe popularized or brought to light, it
    can be profitable to wait as long as possible to pack your Solana blocks because
    then you get access to more order flow. And so this was slowing down the network,
    and it seems like some of the worst offenders of this have been shamed back into
    quickly processing blocks.

    faster block times, and positions Alpen Glow as the solution that removes this
    barrier.

  text: I think Alpen Glow will get rid of both of voting costs, which is kind of
    like the biggest barrier to decreasing block times officially today. And the reason
    for that is, imagine if you reduce block times from where they are today, you're
    effectively doubling voting costs, and so it's a huge strain for smaller validators
    if you just double their voting costs.

    centralization due to increased hardware requirements.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But to my understanding, the downside of that is it becomes quite expensive
    to run the hardware necessary to participate in validating Solana transactions,
    right? So, is there centralization, or only corporations basically are able to
    have the capital to run to be Solana validators in that world?

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: The State Of Solana With Carlos Gonzalez Campo


  This 48-minute episode of *Light Speed* features host Jack Cubanek and Blockworks
  Research analyst Carlos Gonzalez Campo, the resident Solana expert, providing a
  deep dive into the recent technical upgrades, market performance, and ecosystem
  health of the Solana blockchain.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **Solana Blockchain Ecosystem**, covering recent **network
  health and technical upgrades**, **DeFi maturity relative to Ethereum**, **token
  valuation metrics (like REV)**, and the strategic implications of major developments
  like **Jito''s Block-building Architecture for MEV (B.A.M.)**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Network Capacity Upgrades:** Solana has implemented significant upgrades,
  including Jito''s B.A.M. and an increase in the block compute unit limit to 60 million,
  with signaling for 100 million CUs soon, aiming to enhance throughput and efficiency.

  *   **Jito''s B.A.M. (Block-building Architecture for MEV):** This is described
  as a consequential upgrade utilizing an encrypted mempool within a Trusted Execution
  Environment (TEE) to enable private and viable block building. It introduces **plugins**
  for custom transaction sequencing, potentially unlocking previously impossible applications
  like on-chain order books and dark pools.

  *   **Addressing Sandwich Attacks:** B.A.M. offers a structural solution to sandwich
  attacks (front-running/back-running trades) by controlling transaction ordering
  privately, moving beyond the previous, less effective method of blacklisting malicious
  validators.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Price Action & ETH Underperformance:** While SOL recently hit highs near $190,
  the **SOL/ETH ratio is at a yearly low** (below 0.05), indicating Ethereum has significantly
  outperformed Solana in the short term, partly driven by the stablecoin narrative
  and institutional commentary (e.g., Tom Lee).

  *   **REV vs. Price Disconnect:** Solana''s **Transaction Revenue (REV)** dropped
  in June ($62M), lower than most of 2024, suggesting a decrease in high-urgency trading
  activity (like meme coin pumps). This raises questions about justifying the current
  SOL price based solely on this metric.

  *   **DeFi Maturity Gap:** Despite technical improvements, Solana''s DeFi ecosystem
  (e.g., Kamino at $4B TVL) still significantly lags Ethereum''s (e.g., Aave at $50B+
  in assets), particularly in stablecoin liquidity and yield-bearing stablecoin issuance.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jito Labs (Lucas):** Central to the discussion regarding the B.A.M. upgrade,
  which is poised to redefine MEV capture and application design space on Solana.

  *   **Pump:** The meme coin project was noted for its recent price action; its low
  backward-looking Price-to-Sales ratio (3x) was contrasted with declining revenue
  and market share, suggesting investors are discounting future meme coin activity.

  *   **SVM Chains (Ellipsis Labs/Las, Say/Bullet, Fogo):** The proliferation of these
  application-specific chains built on the SVM architecture is noted, but B.A.M.''s
  L1 capabilities may erode their primary competitive edge ("we can do this on our
  chain, but not on Solana L1").

  *   **Katana (Sponsor):** Highlighted as a DeFi-first chain focused on deep liquidity
  and real yield by redirecting chain revenue to active users.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched on the **stablecoin narrative** being heavily leveraged by
  Ethereum, partly due to institutional visibility (like Tom Lee''s appearances).
  While Solana is technically capable of handling stablecoins, the perception and
  current on-chain activity (like the Trump meme coin driving USDC bridging) suggest
  Ethereum still captures the narrative advantage in this area.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The future of Solana hinges on its ability to leverage technical upgrades like B.A.M.
  to unlock new, sophisticated DeFi primitives (like advanced order books) that can
  compete with centralized exchanges and attract deeper, more "productive" liquidity
  beyond speculative trading. The success of B.A.M. plugins will determine if Solana
  can retain native teams currently launching separate SVM L2s.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Professionals, Solana Investors, DeFi Developers, and Blockchain Infrastructure
  Analysts** who need a nuanced, technical, and market-aware update on Solana''s competitive
  positioning against Ethereum.

  ### Comprehensive Summary Narrative


  The podcast provided a comprehensive "state of the union" for Solana, balancing
  recent price strength with underlying technical shifts and ecosystem maturity challenges.
  The conversation began by noting SOL''s recent price surge, which paradoxically
  occurred alongside significant underperformance relative to Ethereum (low SOL/ETH
  ratio), suggesting the market was pricing in Ethereum''s stablecoin narrative strength.


  Carlos Campo highlighted that the recent SOL price strength seemed decoupled from
  the **REV metric**, which showed a notable dip in June, likely due to reduced meme
  coin-driven trading urgency. This prompted a discussion on valuation—whether SOL''s
  price is justified when core revenue indicators soften.


  The core of the episode focused on **Jito’s B.A.M. upgrade**. Campo explained that
  B.A.M. is a fundamental architectural shift using TEEs and an encrypted mempool
  to enable private block building and custom transaction sequencing via **plugins**.
  This innovation is critical because it unlocks advanced DeFi use cases directly
  on the L1, such as private order books and potentially challenging centralized perpetuals
  exchanges like Hyperliquid. A major implication is that B.A.'
