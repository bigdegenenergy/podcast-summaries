  text: Crypto is not a reliable piece of technology today. So that's really why we
    started Inversion, which is we want to acquire traditional businesses where the

    for achieving mass crypto adoption—hiding the blockchain layer.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If I can bring a billion users on chain, I think the way to do that is acquiring
    large businesses with really large user bases and then kind of turning on the

    using financial infrastructure that is powered by blockchain. That candidly is
    our North Star.

    to illustrate how crypto jargon alienates mainstream users, emphasizing the need
    to focus on utility over financialization.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: My advice to the builders that are looking for that next generation of crypto
    growth of how to acquire users and retain users, I mean, you've really got to

    of crypto assets and really leverage blockchains as a tool for global composability
    and accessing global liquidity, and, you know, saving those massive percentage
    fees on processing.

    the Total Addressable Market (TAM) by removing crypto jargon.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Everything should be 'Create Account.' It should not be 'Create Wallet' in
    my opinion if you want to address the bigger TAM.
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: This highlights the crucial need for abstraction in user experience.
    Using 'Create Wallet' alienates mainstream users; 'Create Account' is a necessary
    linguistic shift for broader adoption.

    be "Create Account."
  topic: adoption

  text: part of the biggest issue is you actually have to build something that people
    want. It's not about whether you can make finance more efficient or whatever,
    because for the average person, the average person, they don't need to worry about
    sending a wire over the weekend.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: 'A clear strategy for consumer onboarding: hide the blockchain complexity
    (wallet) until the user is deeply engaged or at the point of transaction where
    the benefit (savings/payment) is realized.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We don't focus on the wallet components at all because it's just not something
    that is core important to the initial user, and something that if you are a crypto
    person, you will find later and you see it. So it's where you really see your
    wallet is at checkout because that's what matters is when you're able to pay.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: 'This is the gold standard for consumer crypto onboarding: providing
    an immediate, tangible financial incentive (cost savings) that requires using
    crypto, rather than just offering abstract technological benefits.'

    get a tangible benefit. It's not, "You can now send a wire on a Sunday." It's
    that bottle you're buying is now costing you less money.

    things like debit cards, asking for, you know, savings accounts, asking for yield—all
    the things that I think folks in the US might think, 'Oh, this is like old stuff,'
    or whatever. Folks in Asia are very much looking at the lens of, 'Oh, wow, this
    is actually, you know, liberty-inducing, and it allows me to actually do stuff
    with my money that I'm actually not allowed to do with right now.'

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Crypto’s Path Forward In The Next 10 Years


  This 40-minute panel discussion, hosted by Jack Kubinec for the Solana-focused podcast
  *Light Speed*, convened builders and investors to dissect the central challenge
  facing the crypto industry: **acquiring and retaining real, non-speculative users.**
  The consensus was that the industry has historically failed at retention due to
  a focus on speculative, casino-like incentives, and the path forward requires making
  the underlying blockchain technology invisible to the end-user.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus was **Consumer Adoption and User Retention in Crypto/Web3**. Key
  themes included:

  *   The failure of speculative incentives to drive long-term user engagement.

  *   Strategies for onboarding traditional businesses and consumers by abstracting
  away crypto complexity.

  *   The critical importance of branding, marketing, and consumer-centric product
  design over pure financialization.

  *   The future role of exchanges and the potential for blockchain as an invisible
  backend infrastructure.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Abstraction of Complexity:** The most successful consumer adoption will occur
  when users interact with services (like mobile plans or bank accounts) where the
  crypto/blockchain rails are completely invisible, eliminating the need for users
  to "Connect Wallet."

  *   **Focus on Utility over Financialization:** Products predicated solely on token
  price volatility or speculative schemes are unsustainable. True value capture requires
  building utility that solves real-world problems (e.g., reducing payment processing
  fees) independent of market conditions.

  *   **Consumer-First Language:** Developers must shift their language from crypto-native
  terms ("Create Wallet") to familiar consumer terms ("Create Account") to expand
  the Total Addressable Market (TAM).


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Inversion Capital Thesis:** Santi’s firm, Inversion Capital, is betting on
  acquiring struggling traditional businesses and implementing blockchain rails to
  create a "step function improvement" in efficiency (e.g., eliminating 2-4% payment
  processing fees).

  *   **The "Toxic Incentive" Problem:** Many crypto projects are currently profitable
  by catering only to existing capital (farming, token pumps), creating perverse incentives
  against building for net-new users.

  *   **Tangible Benefits Drive Onboarding:** The most effective onboarding mechanism
  is providing an immediate, tangible financial benefit. Backes demonstrated this
  by showing users the direct savings from using crypto payments versus credit cards,
  attracting older, non-crypto-native users.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Santi (Inversion Capital):** Championing the strategy of acquiring traditional
  businesses to embed crypto rails invisibly for mass adoption.

  *   **Luca (Pudgy Penguins):** Highlighting the shift from speculative crypto builds
  to IP-driven businesses that focus on capturing the "heart and mind" of consumers,
  evidenced by their success in physical retail (Walmart/Amazon).

  *   **Sfi (Backes):** Discussing their success in onboarding older demographics
  by making the value proposition about saving money on luxury goods (spirits) rather
  than the technology itself.

  *   **Stripe:** Mentioned as a major indicator of the trend, having acquired companies
  (Bridge, Privy) to integrate stablecoin and crypto capabilities, signaling readiness
  for mainstream efficiency gains.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   Santi noted the intentional timing of launching Inversion Capital immediately
  following a major political shift (Trump''s election), emphasizing that the **regulatory
  environment is a crucial factor** when attempting large-scale, real-world adoption
  of blockchain technology.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests that the next decade of crypto growth will not
  come from DeFi innovation alone, but from **infrastructure that is successfully
  integrated into existing, trusted consumer and enterprise workflows.** The industry
  must transition from being a speculative destination to becoming the invisible,
  superior settlement layer for the internet, mirroring how e-commerce removed friction
  from retail.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Web3 Founders, Product Managers, Venture Capitalists,
  and Strategists** focused on scaling crypto beyond the existing native user base
  and achieving mainstream adoption.'
