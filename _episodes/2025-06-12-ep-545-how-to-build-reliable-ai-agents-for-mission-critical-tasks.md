summary: '## Summary of Everyday AI Podcast Episode: Building Reliable Agentic AI
  for Mission-Critical Tasks


  This episode of the Everyday AI Show, featuring **Yash Sheth, Co-founder and COO
  of Galileo**, focused on the urgent industry sprint toward **agentic AI** and the
  critical, yet undefined, playbook for ensuring these agents are **reliable and trustworthy**
  for mission-critical enterprise tasks.


  ### 1. Main Narrative Arc and Key Discussion Points


  The conversation established that while the excitement around AI agents is high—driven
  by the potential for end-to-end automation without a human in the loop—the industry
  lacks a standardized playbook. The core challenge discussed was bridging the gap
  between powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) and deploying them reliably in enterprise
  systems that handle sensitive, dynamic data and real-world actions. The discussion
  moved from defining agents versus chatbots to examining current enterprise adoption,
  and finally, focusing on the necessary foundations for reliability (testing and
  evaluation) before scaling to multi-agent systems.


  ### 2. Major Topics, Themes, and Subject Areas Covered


  *   **Agentic AI Implementation:** The current race by businesses to implement agentic
  workflows.

  *   **Reliability and Trust:** The paramount importance of trust and reliability
  for agents operating on mission-critical tasks.

  *   **Enterprise Adoption Curve:** The "crawl, walk, run" analogy for AI adoption,
  where current chatbot deployments are the "crawl," productionized agents are the
  "walk," and multi-agent systems are the "run."

  *   **Agent Definition:** Distinguishing agents (which involve planning, action,
  and feedback/deflection loops) from traditional chatbots (which typically end with
  an answer).

  *   **Multi-Agent Systems:** The future architecture involving small, specialized
  agents communicating to complete complex workflows (e.g., travel planning, supply
  chain management).


  ### 3. Technical Concepts, Methodologies, or Frameworks Discussed


  *   **Non-Deterministic Software:** The fundamental shift enterprises must adapt
  to, as agents introduce variability that traditional deterministic software did
  not have.

  *   **Test-Driven Development (TDD) for Agents:** The necessity of applying software
  engineering best practices, specifically creating **unit tests and integration tests
  (evals)** tailored to the agent''s specific use case and expected metrics.

  *   **Agent Evals:** The process of creating high-quality evaluations that go beyond
  standard LLM benchmarks and focus on tool selection quality and action correctness.

  *   **Tool Calling/MCP:** Mention of the **Model Communication Protocol (MCP)**
  and Google''s **A2A protocol** as emerging standards simplifying how agents interact
  with tools and each other.

  *   **Galileo Agent Leaderboard:** A practical tool showcasing real-world LLM performance
  across agentic prototypes using specific datasets focused on tool selection quality.


  ### 4. Business Implications and Strategic Insights


  *   **ROI Extraction:** Agents are the key to unlocking the true Return on Investment
  (ROI) from LLMs by automating workflows beyond simple assistance.

  *   **Architectural Shift:** The industry is moving from microservice architectures
  to **micro-agent architectures**, where software components become smarter and more
  independent.

  *   **Regulated Industries:** Even highly regulated sectors (Finance, Healthcare)
  are rapidly moving toward productionizing agents this year, indicating widespread
  confidence in emerging reliability frameworks.

  *   **Mission-Critical Examples:** Successful deployments include agents preempting
  internet outages, managing data platforms, and automating supply chain ordering.


  ### 5. Key Personalities, Experts, or Thought Leaders Mentioned


  *   **Yash Sheth (Co-founder & COO, Galileo):** The primary expert guest, providing
  insights based on Galileo''s work supporting hundreds of enterprise agent development
  teams.

  *   **Jordan Wilson (Host, Everyday AI):** The host driving the conversation.

  *   **Google Gemini Team (via sponsor message):** Mentioned in the context of supporting
  the podcast and promoting their new video generation model, Veo.


  ### 6. Predictions, Trends, or Future-Looking Statements


  *   The next phase of AI adoption will be **multi-agentic systems** ("run" phase).

  *   The industry will converge on **open protocols** (like those being championed
  by the Agency Organization, which Galileo helped found) to ensure seamless communication
  between heterogeneous agents built on different LLMs.

  *   The answer to "which model is best" is dynamic and must be determined via real-world
  agent leaderboards, not static academic benchmarks.


  ### 7. Practical Applications and Real-World Examples


  *   **Preempting Internet Outages:** Agents monitoring infrastructure to prevent
  failures.

  *   **Data Platform Management:** Agents autonomously managing organizational data
  systems.

  *   **Supply Chain Automation:** Agents monitoring warehouse inventory and automatically
  placing orders.

  *   **Travel Booking:** A future multi-agent scenario where one agent plans the
  itinerary and coordinates with specialized agents for flights, hotels, and restaurant
  reservations.


  ### 8. Controversies, Challenges, or Problems Highlighted


  *   **Lack of Playbook:** The primary challenge is the absence of a standardized,
  official playbook for building reliable agents quickly.

  *   **Non-Determinism:** The inherent unpredictability of LLMs makes building reliable
  systems that interact with real-world systems inherently risky.

  *   **Trust in Multi-Agent Handoffs:** In multi-agent scenarios, agents must solve
  for trust, authentication, and clear communication protocols when handing tasks
  between specialized bots.


  ### 9. Solutions, Recommendations, or Actionable Advice Provided


  *   **Prioritize Single-Agent Reliability:** Before tackling complex multi-agent
  systems, organizations must master the CI/CD pipeline and reliability stack for
  individual agents.

  *   **Implement Strong Evals:** Treat agent development like traditional'
