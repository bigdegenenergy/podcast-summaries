summary: '## Crypto Tier List (Best Altcoins To Buy Now) - Podcast Summary


  This 7-minute podcast episode provides a rapid-fire altcoin tier list, ranking major
  blockchain projects based primarily on **recent application revenue (24-hour and
  30-day figures from DeFi Llama)**, while factoring in short-term price action (30-day
  and 60-day returns) to gauge potential for future pumps or necessary corrections.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Cryptocurrency Investment Analysis**, specifically ranking
  established and emerging Layer 1 blockchains (Solana, Ethereum, BNB Chain, Avalanche)
  and key Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols/ecosystems (Hyperliquid, Base ecosystem)
  based on on-chain revenue generation and recent price momentum.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Revenue as a Primary Metric:** The ranking methodology heavily prioritizes
  verifiable application revenue ($250K/24hr minimum and $5M/30-day minimum) over
  simple market cap or hype, suggesting revenue strength underpins long-term value.

  *   **Ecosystem Proxies:** For Layer 2s or platforms without native tokens (like
  Base), the discussion points to key decentralized applications (DApps) like **Aerodrome
  Finance** as the necessary proxy for ecosystem exposure.

  *   **Derivatives Platform Competition:** The rise of decentralized perpetuals platforms
  is highlighted, with **Hyperliquid** leading volume, and **EdgeX** emerging as a
  significant, tokenless competitor showing massive growth in TVL and volume.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Momentum vs. Value:** The host balances strong revenue projects with recent
  price performance. Projects that have pumped significantly (e.g., 50% in 60 days
  like ETH) might be due for a correction or consolidation, while those that have
  lagged slightly (e.g., ETH down 2.2% in 30 days) might have more immediate upside
  potential.

  *   **Wall Street Preference:** Ethereum (ETH) is noted as having "unparalleled"
  institutional appetite, with major firms like BlackRock showing greater interest
  in ETH compared to other altcoins.

  *   **High-Potential Airdrop/Token Event:** **EdgeX** is heavily flagged as a high-conviction
  opportunity due to its strong volume/revenue metrics, high TVL growth (600% in 30
  days), and the anticipation of a forthcoming token generation event (TGE).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Projects Ranked/Discussed:** Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), Hyperliquid (HYPE),
  BNB Chain (BNB), Arbitrum (ARB), Avalanche (AVAX).

  *   **Emerging Platforms:** **EdgeX** (highlighted as the "next Hype" derivatives
  platform) and **Aerodrome Finance** (the recommended proxy for the Base ecosystem).

  *   **Sponsor/Mentioned Entities:** Progressive Insurance (Sponsor), Toyota Camry
  (Sponsor).

  *   **Host:** DeZ (DZ4 Discover Crypto).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  There was **no explicit discussion** of regulatory frameworks, government policy,
  or legal challenges within this short segment. The focus remained strictly on on-chain
  metrics and price action.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a continued rotation of capital within the altcoin market,
  moving from established leaders that have recently peaked (potentially SOL) toward
  undervalued, high-growth areas. The emergence of strong, revenue-generating decentralized
  derivatives platforms like EdgeX signals a maturing DeFi infrastructure layer beyond
  simple spot trading and lending.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This content is most valuable for **Active Cryptocurrency Traders and Investors**
  who are looking for actionable insights on which established Layer 1s to hold, and
  which emerging protocols (especially in the derivatives space) to monitor for potential
  token launches or immediate investment opportunities.

  ### Comprehensive Summary Narrative


  The podcast episode centers on creating a dynamic altcoin tier list using a revenue-centric
  methodology, supplemented by recent price momentum analysis. The host, DeZ, establishes
  strict revenue thresholds ($250K/24hr, $5M/30-day) sourced from DeFi Llama to filter
  the top projects.


  The ranking process involves assessing whether a coin''s recent price action (30/60
  days) suggests it is overbought or due for a correction, thus influencing its placement.
  **Solana** is acknowledged as the revenue leader ($200M/30 days) but is placed in
  the "Good" tier due to its strong recent price performance (+21% in 30 days), suggesting
  less immediate upside. **Ethereum (ETH)**, despite slowing momentum recently (-2.2%
  in 30 days), is placed slightly higher than SOL due to its perceived institutional
  appeal and the rotation of capital away from it in the short term, giving it room
  to run.


  **Hyperliquid (HYPE)**, despite being called a "legendary trade," is downgraded
  from the top tier because its recent price surge (up 17% in a week) indicates it
  might be overheated. The discussion also highlights the **Base** ecosystem, recommending
  **Aerodrome Finance** as the key exposure vehicle in the absence of a native Base
  token.


  The most significant actionable insight is the deep dive into **EdgeX**. The host
  strongly positions EdgeX, a tokenless derivatives platform currently ranking second
  only to Hyperliquid in volume, as the "next Hype." Metrics cited include 600% TVL
  growth and robust daily volume, leading the host to suggest a token generation event
  is imminent and that EdgeX warrants immediate attention. **Arbitrum (ARB)** and'
