    EQ, RQ), suggesting that current AI focus (IQ-heavy) misses crucial elements of
    true intelligence.
  relevance_score: 9

    definitions over time, suggesting AUI is a more stable, actionable goal.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I'm a huge fan of AUI rather than AGI, ASI, whatever we may call it, actually,

    10 years or even 20 years of history, the definition keeps on evolving all the
    time.

    are achieving benchmarks previously expected years in the future, referencing

    right, they're on the charts where we might have expected them to be four or five
    years ago, right, when we're looking at early GPT models.

    governing AI agents/tools, emphasizing the need for new management skills.
  relevance_score: 9

  text: It becomes even more important for us to be able to learn to manage these
    tools, if I may say so. No, people have said it, as I said earlier as well, that
    if you look at the information technology department of the future, currently
    it's comprised of lots of people. I would say the information technology department
    of the future is people who are operating these tools, managing these tools, governing
    these tools, but will become a lot more automated in the future. So it's like
    people managing these agents, if I may say, these agents happen to be digital
    agents.

    (time saved, fulfillment gained), not by raw LLM usage metrics (like token count
    or API calls).'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is not about how many calls you made to a large language model. I don't
    care what. I care about is the end value that you deliver to me. The end value
    is the time consumed in my day-to-day life, which is going into things that may

summary: '## Podcast Summary: EP 521: Why Artificial Useful Intelligence (AUI) Matters
  More Than AGI


  This episode of the Everyday AI Show, featuring **Ruchir Peri (Chief Scientist at
  IBM Research and IBM Fellow)**, shifts the focus from the often-hyped pursuit of
  Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) to the more pragmatic and immediately impactful
  concept of **Artificial Useful Intelligence (AUI)**. The core argument is that usefulness
  in day-to-day tasks and business operations should be the primary metric for AI
  advancement, rather than chasing an ill-defined benchmark of general human-level
  intelligence.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on redefining AI success metrics, contrasting the abstract
  goal of AGI with the tangible benefits of AUI. Key areas covered include:

  *   The historical milestones of AI (Deep Blue, Watson) and why they didn''t equate
  to AGI.

  *   The comprehensive nature of human intelligence (IQ, EQ, RQ).

  *   The profound impact of current LLMs on knowledge work, drawing parallels to
  the Industrial Revolution.

  *   The critical role of **AI Agents** as the next major technological shift beyond
  simple feed-forward LLMs.

  *   Practical applications of AUI in software development and cybersecurity.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Intelligence Redefined:** True human intelligence is a combination of **IQ
  (Intelligence Quotient)**, **EQ (Emotional Quotient)**, and **RQ (Relationship Quotient)**;
  current AI heavily over-indexes on the IQ component.

  *   **The Agent Paradigm Shift:** The next major leap is moving from **feed-forward
  systems** (input $\rightarrow$ output, requiring human prompt engineering to correct)
  to **AI Agents**. Agents can analyze their own output against the user''s intent,
  iterate, use external tools (databases, business processes), and accomplish subtasks
  autonomously.

  *   **Software Engineering Agents:** A tangible example of AUI is agents capable
  of analyzing complex codebases, diagnosing issues described in natural language,
  suggesting fixes with reasoning, and automatically implementing those fixes, drastically
  reducing developer toil.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Focus on ROI over Hype:** Businesses should prioritize AUI—technology that
  demonstrably saves time, increases productivity, and fulfills daily operational
  needs—over chasing AGI milestones.

  *   **The Evolving IT Department:** The future IT department will consist less of
  manual executors and more of people who **manage, govern, and operate** these digital
  AI agents, requiring new skill sets in oversight and control.

  *   **Accountability is Key:** Since the "buck stops" with humans, understanding
  and controlling the AI tools being used (especially agents) is paramount for maintaining
  accountability and governance within business processes.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Ruchir Peri (IBM):** The central expert, advocating for the AUI framework
  based on his decades of experience in automation, semiconductors, and AI at IBM.

  *   **IBM Research:** Highlighted for historical achievements (Deep Blue, Watson)
  and current focus on enterprise utility, including software engineering agents.

  *   **Marc Andreessen:** Mentioned for his famous 2011 quote, "Software is eating
  the world," setting the stage for the current era where AI is poised to revolutionize
  how software itself is built and maintained.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is moving toward **actionable, autonomous
  systems (Agents)** that integrate deeply into existing workflows (like coding and
  security). This revolution will mirror the Industrial Revolution, not by eliminating
  work, but by providing powerful tools that allow knowledge workers to achieve unprecedented
  productivity and focus on more fulfilling, higher-level tasks (EQ/RQ-centric work).


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI/Tech Professionals, Business Leaders, and
  Decision-Makers** who are struggling to translate generative AI investments into
  measurable business value (ROI) and need a pragmatic framework for prioritizing
  AI adoption over speculative research.'
