    asset people go to it. But in moments of crisis, like not over in a three-month
    crisis, right? Because that's when Bitcoin actually does pretty well. But in the
    reaction to news, Bitcoin is a very, very liquid market. And because the Bitcoin
    is a very liquid market, people panic. News breaks, sell. What do you sell? What's
    liquid? What's open? Bitcoin's the only thing available to sell.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Bitcoin’s $10K Candles Are Coming — Get Ready
  | Anthony & John Pompliano


  This 50-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast, featuring Anthony Pompliano and John
  Pompliano, centers on analyzing recent market volatility in Bitcoin and traditional
  equities, arguing against imminent market crashes, and detailing the new macroeconomic
  reality driven by central bank intervention.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion primarily focuses on **Cryptocurrency Markets (specifically Bitcoin)**,
  **Traditional Equity Markets (Stock Market)**, and **Macroeconomic Policy/Geopolitics**
  as they relate to asset valuation and investor behavior.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin Liquidity Event:** The recent $19 billion liquidation event in Bitcoin,
  which saw a sharp drop followed by a rapid recovery (e.g., $121K to $108K and back
  within 48 hours), served to **wipe out excess leverage**, setting the stage for
  potentially higher moves.

  *   **24/7 Market Superiority:** Geopolitical events occurring outside traditional
  stock market hours highlight the structural advantage of Bitcoin and crypto markets,
  which operate **24/7/365**, attracting users seeking immediate trading access during
  global news breaks.

  *   **Maturing Dollar Volatility:** Bitcoin is maturing, evidenced by large dollar
  swings (e.g., $10K-$15K drops). While percentage moves remain relatively small,
  the **aggregate dollar amount of daily moves will increase**, signaling a transition
  from an "infant/toddler" asset to an "adolescent" one.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Pessimism is Misplaced:** The hosts argue that fears of an imminent market
  crash or bubble are unfounded, citing respected figures like Howard Marks expressing
  bullishness and the fact that the current bull market is only three years into an
  average 7-8 year cycle.

  *   **Efficiency Drives Valuation:** Modern companies (like Palantir) are achieving
  higher growth rates with *fewer* employees, increasing revenue per employee. This
  fundamental shift justifies higher valuation multiples, as companies are realizing
  future profits faster than ever before.

  *   **Fed Put Dominance:** The Federal Reserve''s playbook is now firmly established:
  they will not allow a prolonged bear market (over 18 months). Any significant market
  downturn will trigger aggressive monetary stimulus (rate cuts, quantitative easing),
  effectively capping downside risk for asset owners.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **President Trump:** Mentioned for his use of social media (e.g., tariff announcements)
  to manipulate market conversation and negotiate geopolitically, often waiting for
  specific market opening times.

  *   **Howard Marks (Oaktree Capital):** Noted for his typically cautious stance;
  his current assessment that the market is *not* a bubble is seen as a strong bullish
  indicator.

  *   **Jamie Dimon (JPMorgan Chase):** Cited as another major figure confirming the
  current environment is a bull market.

  *   **Palantir:** Used as a prime example of a company demonstrating extreme efficiency
  gains (growing revenue while reducing headcount).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The core policy discussion revolves around **Central Bank Intervention**. The hosts
  assert that the Fed prioritizes asset price stability and economic stimulation over
  currency purchasing power. They note that the government destroyed 30% of the USD''s
  purchasing power in five years post-pandemic, demonstrating a clear preference for
  stimulating asset markets over maintaining currency integrity.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where **asset prices are structurally supported
  by central bank intervention**, making prolonged bear markets unlikely. This environment
  favors investors who "buy the dip" and hold assets that appreciate due to efficiency
  gains. Bitcoin''s role as a 24/7 liquid asset will continue to grow as tokenization
  expands and investors seek markets that don''t close during crises. Bitcoin will
  achieve "adult" status (true maturity) when it crosses a $10 trillion market capitalization
  threshold, at which point institutions and central banks will fully embrace it.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Active Crypto Investors, Institutional Investors,
  and Financial Professionals** interested in macro trends, Fed policy implications,
  and the evolving maturity curve of Bitcoin as an asset class.'
