    a potential bottom, though cautioning that further downside is possible.
  - Avalanche (AVAX) is highlighted as a current top performer, showing significant
    strength against the recent Bitcoin dip.
  - The host is highly skeptical of the ranking of NEAR Protocol based on active users,
    suspecting bot activity due to low trading volume relative to address count.
  - BNB is viewed positively due to high trading volume and AI integrations, with
    the host dismissing centralization concerns as irrelevant to most investors.
  - The speaker believes the 2021-style parabolic alt season is over, predicting only
    a few selected plays will see massive gains, making locking into strong projects
    crucial.
  - Astor saw massive recent gains, but the host advises against FOMO buying now,
    suggesting waiting for a correction after a violent short squeeze.
  - The fundamental driver for crypto success is the broken fiat system and the declining
    US Dollar Index, positioning Bitcoin as the primary solution.
  overview: This crypto analysis focuses on identifying potential top-performing altcoins

    and potential, while also providing tactical trading insights based on chart divergences.
