  extracted: for us the guys what are the top two bottlenecks at the perimeter so
    things like KYC AML while UX things of that nature what are the two biggest bottlenecks
    and then what's fixed and what do you think is going to change in the next couple
    quarters yeah I understand yeah sure I feel like we should give you a chance to
    talk all right well my wife doesn't always to say that so look at a high level
    when I think about frictions and sort of what are the things that are barriers
    to stablecoin use case right we're just using stablecoins I'd say there are really
    two big buckets two meta buckets the first is is the thing trusted trusted compliant
    and transparent in other words do I need the Thompson's banknote guide or something
    like it to know whether or not I'm actually going to get my dollar back right
    I think the genius act largely solves that problem particularly as it's implemented
    because all stablecoins aren't equal and all stablecoins aren't stable so I think
    making sure that we have payment stablecoins that actually are held to very high
    standards is job number one good news is is this country's made a very important
    decision on a broad bipartisan basis and I feel like where that problem is being
    solved second aspect though is is does assuming dollar solid the stablecoin is
    solid is it actually useful does it have utility does it have liquidity one one
    example I like to give is suppose at the end of this conference the federal reserve
    board says good news we're going to give each everybody money to buy your dinner
    at Reagan Airport but we're not going to give you a federal reserve note we're
    going to give you 50 euros would you be able to actually buy your dinner at Reagan
    with euros it's a perfectly solid currency it's an outstanding one it's it holds
    its value but it's not necessarily have utility in certain settings and so two
    big barriers to utility and liquidity are number one and this was mentioned earlier
    the banking rails making sure that you can move in and out of fiat currency back
    into something like a USDC or a Paxo stablecoin as as quickly and seamlessly as
    possible so circle for example has spent years building out this network of reserve
    banks and and partner banks for customers in fact were pleased that fifth third
    is is is a part of that is a part of that network so that's the first thing and
    then the second thing for barriers would be the blockchains themselves USDC is
    natively on 28 different blockchains but it's very difficult to move currencies
    among blockchains we have something called the cross chain transfer protocol but
    again if you're if your stablecoin only works on one or two blockchains again
    that's another barrier point and maybe what I'll add is I'm maybe breaking into
    two categories one is some of the fresh in the stablecoin world is how do you
    get back off out of the stablecoin world and he's describing a lot of those especially
    when you live in a world where you have to move money 24 seven and so this adds
    quite a bit of complexity if you think about well someone shows up with a stablecoin
    they want dollars and it's you know 11 30 on a Friday how do you make that possible
    and there are plenty of examples of that and then on the other hand it could be
    you know I'm in Asia and I'm putting money to work and I want to make sure that
    I'm able to get a stablecoin and you know you're tied to us making hours and so
    there's many different types of complexities around interacting with the traditional
    financial system while being able to have an effective stablecoin product that
    works the second component is exactly what Kyle was describing which is I'd say
    DeFi and crypto is still not abstracted away enough where it's solving just the
    problem as opposed to requiring you to actually understand the underlying mechanics
    to date myself I kind of think back to trying to go on the internet and it was
    like trying to get on when there was a thing called free net and you know you
    had to like dial up and you put this like receiver on a thing and you know like
    you got some weird noises and you could get like a little line of text that would
    come down by the way like as absurd as that sounds that's actually not that unusual
    when you kind of go through the DeFi ecosystem you know and it really shouldn't
    be that way or frankly just crypto in general I think that'll all get abstracted
    away with great consumer products that allow you to solve a problem just like
    you know you don't know how the phone works really almost nobody does but yet
    everyone knows how to use it crypto blockchain DeFi stablecoins need to be just
    like that which is I think what dollar app is for instance doing which is just
    making it so I can solve my problem is I want to be able to move dollars I want
    to be able to hold dollars I want to be able to have it happen instantaneously
    and needs to be that simple at all times there are so many different complexities
    depending on exactly what your use case is for stablecoins still and so I think
    those things are all problems that can be easily solved people working really
    hard at solving them and I think that they will absolutely get there there are
    large firms like a PayPal which launched a stablecoin several years ago and they
    were one of the first to come out and say they want to launch it at being a scaled
    financial institution we don't want to call the ask you welcome and and add only
    we come trapped by their real fintech company really huge in terms of their scale
    and they launched a stablecoin and that's an example of someone being able to
    take this technology and be able to they don't want to be called tradify on the
    traditional system and be able to try to solve problems in a way that you couldn't
    know that word that's how I look at what it can happen here nobody knows next
    a going key to you got a solo one what are some programmable future features maybe
    things like allowless conditional transfers and others that are going to make
    stables invisible in workflows in the next six to twelve months hopefully we can
    overcome some of these challenges yeah the the whole goal I was thinking about
    this the other day and I remember about 20 years ago you would talk to someone
    a family member and you'd say well up we should go out we get we should buy this
    thing and someone would say well I'm going to go on the internet and buy it right
    we don't say that anymore we just buy it it's just assumed and so we're going
    to get to a point where stablecoins themselves are just floating around like any
    other form of electronic money like credit cards debit cards some most of which
    are by the way are not legal tender and so what are some of the programmable use
    cases that sort of we're thinking about you know circle is focused on all use
    cases but particularly thinking about enterprises right and so I'm often overseas
    I'm talking to let's just say a Korean manufacturer who wants to sell goods overseas
    to Latin America it takes five days for the money to move and sometimes takes
    it you know is extremely costly so you can imagine a scenario where all of this
    is built in and the moment the goods leave the factory floor through smart contract
    technology and program ability the money is automatically sent or when it's received
    on the other end so a trade finance and just trade in general is something that
    could be supercharged through stablecoins and the program program the program
    ability that that it offers another thing we're we're seeing is treasury functions
    right and even for scale financial institutions we have a large scale financial
    institution that is actually using USDC for example to move money inside the institution
    across borders I'm not up to kill this again a lot of 90% and the fee to say that
    in some ways we need more than just programmable money we all feel good rails
    to be enterprise grade so one of the things that that circle is doing is we're
    reading the CPMI IOSCO paper we're reading stuff from the BIS and we're saying
    what are the barriers to large enterprise use of of blockchains saying that we
    can actually make program ability really effective and so we're developing something
    called ARC which is sort of an enterprise grates L1 blockchain that has you know
    sub-second deterministic finality that that makes it very you know you send the
    money boom it's done you don't have to wait there's no probability there's no
    51 percent attack concern using something that's very stable like a USDC as gas
    and other features as well including privacy layers so it's just very important
    to say you you got to combine the programmability with the with the underlying
    infrastructure as well to really unlock these use cases the I can just jump in
    on that one I think there's a lot to be done here I think one point of encouragement
    for anybody who is building like we have a fairly sizable business essentially
    selling software like subscription software to corporates to automate payment
    workflows about a third of the total revenue the bank does annually now is attached
    to people who utilize software to eliminate some manual staff whether it's recon
    or payment scheduling otherwise there's a lot you can do with programmability
    that is technically better than people using bill pay services to schedule a payment
    right but it has to be much better in order for people to change the behavior
    like the law of good enough works against any new technology because if the existing
    method works well and it doesn't cost much and especially on the consumer side
    of the equation most payment initiation is free in the US you have to be able
    to demonstrate some significantly better value so demonstrating programmability
    showing people hey you can program the payments so that it moves consistent with
    you know your payment contract is not meaningfully better than just pre-programming
    you know you're whatever sourcing software you're using to initiate an ACH instruction
    at the point in time when you've hit the date that payment is due you have to
    actually focus on the integration right that is the place where you can improve
    a step so instead of having to pass contracts and have somebody sitting you know
    in a bullpen somewhere work in a P file that there are agreements that are standardized
    at the time of the procurement that then pass straight through to the financial
    institution or the wallet provider that then automated just that's the step we're
    going to have to take here because just because we can doesn't mean anybody will
    so just saying is there's a change that I think we have a follow on here for you
    um what's actually production already now for enterprises and specifically around
    things like illicit activity attention and where false positives are going to
    buy this yeah so so the whole area of making sure you're on something that's trusted
    right is just is many ways critical for enterprise adoption right and enterprise
    is going to feel is is going to be extremely hesitant to risk its reputation to
    go on a blockchain where potentially North Korea is a validator right and so there
    are a number of like that that we're taking into account so for example arc the
    blockchain that we're creating will actually have permission validators so everyone
    will be better than in advance and and also making sure that that the institution
    that you're getting the digital assets from has an AML CTF program it's compliant
    with the Patriot Act all of those things matter the good old Patriot Act are going
    to interoperability and orchestration this one's for all of y'all so if you'll
    feel free to jump in keep a clean out there boys and where is interop already
    good enough and where is it brittle what orchestration layer or layers are going
    to enable a truly tech agnostic experience actually I can get started from the
    consumer standpoint at in this it's not so expensive to maintain some liquidity
    buffers to orchestrate because even today like it's it's still pretty aggregated
    like the question is what happens if we end up in one of these like ridiculous
    situations where it's so atomized know that that but right now my you know from
    the consumer standpoint I would say we don't see that being a big issue you need
    to hold some liquidity buffers but but again no like you don't we have effects
    exposure you have some credit risk that need to manage but we have an encounter
    that being a big problem okay can you just see like on the on the scale side how
    do you guys perceive you know that but on our end it has made a big deal I given
    the interest that we expressed on cross-border payments it's the on-ramps and
    the off-ramps it's the point you made earlier about the need to cobble together
    your own ecosystem if you want to move money utilizing stablecoins today the actual
    use of the rail is much easier than getting money in and then getting it out in
    another jurisdiction ensuring that the person that you're paying is the ability
    to accept it and to convert it back to fiat and I my big fear like I think there
    are lots of really interesting things that can be done with tokenized deposits
    but that's the place where I think the interoperability issues the biggest if
    we can land on a handful of call it standard stable coin payment rails I don't
    know that interoperability some problems so much as it is just getting to a point
    where the adoption on both sides of the network on the send and the receive side
    are native supposed to through a third party and then a transfer we're a bit of
    a strange inner regnum where the genus act has passed but and you can be a forward
    looking genius compliant but you aren't genius compliant today and and so that's
    actually create a huge proliferation of stablecoin issuers from a white label
    side and otherwise and so I actually think if you had a moment of risk where something
    could go wrong it's probably now between now and 18 months from now because you
    have so many different firms that are operating in ways that may or may not end
    up looking like they've aged well but I do think that once genius comes into effect
    when the rules are put into place and everyone is I have to follow them which
    I guess gets you all the way to three years from when it passed you're going to
    have a clear set of rules and that should create a level of fungibility that can
    be relied upon as long as you know the standards are widely enforced and I think
    also adopted in a number of different international jurisdictions so that you
    create this capacity where it is truly cash and cash equivalents and I think that's
    where we'll go and so between blockchain and standards you do create a capacity
    to have interoperability in a forward looking basis you don't today because stablecoins
    still have counterparty rest of them depending on exactly how they're constructed
    most of them still do and certainly a lot of the new ones also do as well and
    so that's where there's a real interesting dynamic that exists right now I think
    that also and this is really I think Tim's point there is a lot of complexity
    around having to be able to manage that liquidity because those are not the same
    liabilities they're almost in some ways akin though not the exact same thing as
    a deposit because you know you have the counterparty risk related to them I think
    that'll all get worked out over time and you know we'll get to that end state
    where I think that will lessen maybe either the capital they might have to hold
    against a stablecoins the amount of risk limits that you would have to put into
    place the counterparty capital charges that you might need to carry but I don't
    think we're there yet so we're getting there but there's a lot more work to be
    done yet maybe you asked about orchestration I think and this goes to sort of
    Tim's point about sort of not not unsolving problems that have been solved you
    know a lot of the domestic payment system works rather well there there are obviously
    improvements that can be made but once you step outside you as borders it becomes
    a lot more complex so one example of orchestration is something we've created
    called the circle payments network where we have institutions on various sides
    that orchestrating effects flows using what governor waller has called the stablecoin
    sandwich but right now to send money to to Brazil from the United States or from
    the European Union of the United States it can take up to 72 hours going through
    various correspondent bank accounts we've been able to get that down to 72 seconds
    using basically fiat on either end and then the stablecoin rails in between so
    it's a great example of where orchestration as you as you ask the question actually
    can make a difference to solve a problem that is a real barrier to use case the
    other point I just want to think about is tokenized deposits we've mentioned it
    a couple of times there's a couple lines in the genius act that just gives a scant
    reference to it but this country has never really thought about tokenized deposits
    and the potential impact on the banking system and as a former regulator myself
    I'd ask the question I think you used the term it used 490 in 996 banks in the
    United States yeah if in fact 5,000 banks in the United States many of which are
    communities smaller banks immediately overnight tokenized their deposits they
    moved at the speed of the internet 24-7 as a bank regulator I might be a little
    concerned about that right and so I think if we are going to go down the road
    of tokenized deposits unlike stablecoins that are back one to one with very high
    quality liquid assets if we're using the fractional reserve banking system which
    is subject to deposit insurance the discount window and essentially a government
    intervention model and we're going to tokenize that and move it quickly through
    blockchains I think more public policy work should be done
  text: the opportunity is for us the guys what are the top two bottlenecks at the
    perimeter so things like KYC AML while UX things of that nature what are the two
    biggest bottlenecks and then what's fixed and what do you think is going to change
    in the next couple quarters yeah I understand yeah sure I feel like we should
    give you a chance to talk all right well my wife doesn't always to say that so
    look at a high level when I think about frictions and sort of what are the things
    that are barriers to stablecoin use case right we're just using stablecoins I'd
    say there are really two big buckets two meta buckets the first is is the thing
    trusted trusted compliant and transparent in other words do I need the Thompson's

    stablecoins aren't stable so I think making sure that we have payment stablecoins
    that actually are held to very high standards is job number one good news is is
    this country's made a very important decision on a broad bipartisan basis and
    I feel like where that problem is being solved second aspect though is is does
    assuming dollar solid the stablecoin is solid is it actually useful does it have
    utility does it have liquidity one one example I like to give is suppose at the
    end of this conference the federal reserve board says good news we're going to
    give each everybody money to buy your dinner at Reagan Airport but we're not going
    to give you a federal reserve note we're going to give you 50 euros would you
    be able to actually buy your dinner at Reagan with euros it's a perfectly solid
    currency it's an outstanding one it's it holds its value but it's not necessarily
    have utility in certain settings and so two big barriers to utility and liquidity
    are number one and this was mentioned earlier the banking rails making sure that
    you can move in and out of fiat currency back into something like a USDC or a
    Paxo stablecoin as as quickly and seamlessly as possible so circle for example
    has spent years building out this network of reserve banks and and partner banks
    for customers in fact were pleased that fifth third is is is a part of that is
    a part of that network so that's the first thing and then the second thing for
    barriers would be the blockchains themselves USDC is natively on 28 different
    blockchains but it's very difficult to move currencies among blockchains we have
    something called the cross chain transfer protocol but again if you're if your
    stablecoin only works on one or two blockchains again that's another barrier point
    and maybe what I'll add is I'm maybe breaking into two categories one is some
    of the fresh in the stablecoin world is how do you get back off out of the stablecoin
    world and he's describing a lot of those especially when you live in a world where

    right that is the place where you can improve a step so instead of having to pass
    contracts and have somebody sitting you know in a bullpen somewhere work in a
    P file that there are agreements that are standardized at the time of the procurement
    that then pass straight through to the financial institution or the wallet provider
    that then automated just that's the step we're going to have to take here because
    just because we can doesn't mean anybody will so just saying is there's a change
    that I think we have a follow on here for you um what's actually production already
    now for enterprises and specifically around things like illicit activity attention
    and where false positives are going to buy this yeah so so the whole area of making
    sure you're on something that's trusted right is just is many ways critical for
    enterprise adoption right and enterprise is going to feel is is going to be extremely
    hesitant to risk its reputation to go on a blockchain where potentially North
    Korea is a validator right and so there are a number of like that that we're taking
    into account so for example arc the blockchain that we're creating will actually
    have permission validators so everyone will be better than in advance and and
    also making sure that that the institution that you're getting the digital assets
    from has an AML CTF program it's compliant with the Patriot Act all of those things
    matter the good old Patriot Act are going to interoperability and orchestration
    this one's for all of y'all so if you'll feel free to jump in keep a clean out
    there boys and where is interop already good enough and where is it brittle what
    orchestration layer or layers are going to enable a truly tech agnostic experience
    actually I can get started from the consumer standpoint at in this it's not so
    expensive to maintain some liquidity buffers to orchestrate because even today
    like it's it's still pretty aggregated like the question is what happens if we
    end up in one of these like ridiculous situations where it's so atomized know
    that that but right now my you know from the consumer standpoint I would say we
    don't see that being a big issue you need to hold some liquidity buffers but but
    again no like you don't we have effects exposure you have some credit risk that
    need to manage but we have an encounter that being a big problem okay can you
    just see like on the on the scale side how do you guys perceive you know that
    but on our end it has made a big deal I given the interest that we expressed on
    cross-border payments it's the on-ramps and the off-ramps it's the point you made
    earlier about the need to cobble together your own ecosystem if you want to move
    money utilizing stablecoins today the actual use of the rail is much easier than
    getting money in and then getting it out in another jurisdiction ensuring that
    the person that you're paying is the ability to accept it and to convert it back
    to fiat and I my big fear like I think there are lots of really interesting things
    that can be done with tokenized deposits but that's the place where I think the
    interoperability issues the biggest if we can land on a handful of call it standard
    stable coin payment rails I don't know that interoperability some problems so
    much as it is just getting to a point where the adoption on both sides of the
    network on the send and the receive side are native supposed to through a third
    party and then a transfer we're a bit of a strange inner regnum where the genus
    act has passed but and you can be a forward looking genius compliant but you aren't
    genius compliant today and and so that's actually create a huge proliferation
    of stablecoin issuers from a white label side and otherwise and so I actually
    think if you had a moment of risk where something could go wrong it's probably
    now between now and 18 months from now because you have so many different firms
    that are operating in ways that may or may not end up looking like they've aged
    well but I do think that once genius comes into effect when the rules are put
    into place and everyone is I have to follow them which I guess gets you all the
    way to three years from when it passed you're going to have a clear set of rules
    and that should create a level of fungibility that can be relied upon as long
    as you know the standards are widely enforced and I think also adopted in a number
    of different international jurisdictions so that you create this capacity where
    it is truly cash and cash equivalents and I think that's where we'll go and so
    between blockchain and standards you do create a capacity to have interoperability
    in a forward looking basis you don't today because stablecoins still have counterparty
    rest of them depending on exactly how they're constructed most of them still do
    and certainly a lot of the new ones also do as well and so that's where there's
    a real interesting dynamic that exists right now I think that also and this is
    really I think Tim's point there is a lot of complexity around having to be able
    to manage that liquidity because those are not the same liabilities they're almost
    in some ways akin though not the exact same thing as a deposit because you know
    you have the counterparty risk related to them I think that'll all get worked
    out over time and you know we'll get to that end state where I think that will
    lessen maybe either the capital they might have to hold against a stablecoins
    the amount of risk limits that you would have to put into place the counterparty
    capital charges that you might need to carry but I don't think we're there yet
    so we're getting there but there's a lot more work to be done yet maybe you asked
    about orchestration I think and this goes to sort of Tim's point about sort of
    not not unsolving problems that have been solved you know a lot of the domestic
    payment system works rather well there there are obviously improvements that can
    be made but once you step outside you as borders it becomes a lot more complex
    so one example of orchestration is something we've created called the circle payments
    network where we have institutions on various sides that orchestrating effects
    flows using what governor waller has called the stablecoin sandwich but right
    now to send money to to Brazil from the United States or from the European Union
    of the United States it can take up to 72 hours going through various correspondent
    bank accounts we've been able to get that down to 72 seconds using basically fiat
    on either end and then the stablecoin rails in between so it's a great example
    of where orchestration as you as you ask the question actually can make a difference
    to solve a problem that is a real barrier to use case the other point I just want
    to think about is tokenized deposits we've mentioned it a couple of times there's
    a couple lines in the genius act that just gives a scant reference to it but this
    country has never really thought about tokenized deposits and the potential impact
    on the banking system and as a former regulator myself I'd ask the question I
    think you used the term it used 490 in 996 banks in the United States yeah if
    in fact 5,000 banks in the United States many of which are communities smaller
    banks immediately overnight tokenized their deposits they moved at the speed of
    the internet 24-7 as a bank regulator I might be a little concerned about that
    right and so I think if we are going to go down the road of tokenized deposits
    unlike stablecoins that are back one to one with very high quality liquid assets
    if we're using the fractional reserve banking system which is subject to deposit
    insurance the discount window and essentially a government intervention model
    and we're going to tokenize that and move it quickly through blockchains I think
    more public policy work should be done.

  confidence: medium
  extracted: give you a chance to talk all right well my wife doesn't always to say
    that so look at a high level when I think about frictions and sort of what are
    the things that are barriers to stablecoin use case right we're just using stablecoins
    I'd say there are really two big buckets two meta buckets the first is is the
    thing trusted trusted compliant and transparent in other words do I need the Thompson's
    banknote guide or something like it to know whether or not I'm actually going
    to get my dollar back right I think the genius act largely solves that problem
    particularly as it's implemented because all stablecoins aren't equal and all
    stablecoins aren't stable so I think making sure that we have payment stablecoins
    that actually are held to very high standards is job number one good news is is
    this country's made a very important decision on a broad bipartisan basis and
    I feel like where that problem is being solved second aspect though is is does
    assuming dollar solid the stablecoin is solid is it actually useful does it have
    utility does it have liquidity one one example I like to give is suppose at the
    end of this conference the federal reserve board says good news we're going to
    give each everybody money to buy your dinner at Reagan Airport but we're not going
    to give you a federal reserve note we're going to give you 50 euros would you
    be able to actually buy your dinner at Reagan with euros it's a perfectly solid
    currency it's an outstanding one it's it holds its value but it's not necessarily
    have utility in certain settings and so two big barriers to utility and liquidity
    are number one and this was mentioned earlier the banking rails making sure that
    you can move in and out of fiat currency back into something like a USDC or a
    Paxo stablecoin as as quickly and seamlessly as possible so circle for example
    has spent years building out this network of reserve banks and and partner banks
    for customers in fact were pleased that fifth third is is is a part of that is
    a part of that network so that's the first thing and then the second thing for
    barriers would be the blockchains themselves USDC is natively on 28 different
    blockchains but it's very difficult to move currencies among blockchains we have
    something called the cross chain transfer protocol but again if you're if your
    stablecoin only works on one or two blockchains again that's another barrier point
    and maybe what I'll add is I'm maybe breaking into two categories one is some
    of the fresh in the stablecoin world is how do you get back off out of the stablecoin
    world and he's describing a lot of those especially when you live in a world where
    you have to move money 24 seven and so this adds quite a bit of complexity if
    you think about well someone shows up with a stablecoin they want dollars and
    it's you know 11 30 on a Friday how do you make that possible and there are plenty
    of examples of that and then on the other hand it could be you know I'm in Asia
    and I'm putting money to work and I want to make sure that I'm able to get a stablecoin
    and you know you're tied to us making hours and so there's many different types
    of complexities around interacting with the traditional financial system while
    being able to have an effective stablecoin product that works the second component
    is exactly what Kyle was describing which is I'd say DeFi and crypto is still
    not abstracted away enough where it's solving just the problem as opposed to requiring
    you to actually understand the underlying mechanics to date myself I kind of think
    back to trying to go on the internet and it was like trying to get on when there
    was a thing called free net and you know you had to like dial up and you put this
    like receiver on a thing and you know like you got some weird noises and you could
    get like a little line of text that would come down by the way like as absurd
    as that sounds that's actually not that unusual when you kind of go through the
    DeFi ecosystem you know and it really shouldn't be that way or frankly just crypto
    in general I think that'll all get abstracted away with great consumer products
    that allow you to solve a problem just like you know you don't know how the phone
    works really almost nobody does but yet everyone knows how to use it crypto blockchain
    DeFi stablecoins need to be just like that which is I think what dollar app is
    for instance doing which is just making it so I can solve my problem is I want
    to be able to move dollars I want to be able to hold dollars I want to be able
    to have it happen instantaneously and needs to be that simple at all times there
    are so many different complexities depending on exactly what your use case is
    for stablecoins still and so I think those things are all problems that can be
    easily solved people working really hard at solving them and I think that they
    will absolutely get there there are large firms like a PayPal which launched a
    stablecoin several years ago and they were one of the first to come out and say
    they want to launch it at being a scaled financial institution we don't want to
    call the ask you welcome and and add only we come trapped by their real fintech
    company really huge in terms of their scale and they launched a stablecoin and
    that's an example of someone being able to take this technology and be able to
    they don't want to be called tradify on the traditional system and be able to
    try to solve problems in a way that you couldn't know that word that's how I look
    at what it can happen here nobody knows next a going key to you got a solo one
    what are some programmable future features maybe things like allowless conditional
    transfers and others that are going to make stables invisible in workflows in
    the next six to twelve months hopefully we can overcome some of these challenges
    yeah the the whole goal I was thinking about this the other day and I remember
    about 20 years ago you would talk to someone a family member and you'd say well
    up we should go out we get we should buy this thing and someone would say well
    I'm going to go on the internet and buy it right we don't say that anymore we
    just buy it it's just assumed and so we're going to get to a point where stablecoins
    themselves are just floating around like any other form of electronic money like
    credit cards debit cards some most of which are by the way are not legal tender
    and so what are some of the programmable use cases that sort of we're thinking
    about you know circle is focused on all use cases but particularly thinking about
    enterprises right and so I'm often overseas I'm talking to let's just say a Korean
    manufacturer who wants to sell goods overseas to Latin America it takes five days
    for the money to move and sometimes takes it you know is extremely costly so you
    can imagine a scenario where all of this is built in and the moment the goods
    leave the factory floor through smart contract technology and program ability
    the money is automatically sent or when it's received on the other end so a trade
    finance and just trade in general is something that could be supercharged through
    stablecoins and the program program the program ability that that it offers another
    thing we're we're seeing is treasury functions right and even for scale financial
    institutions we have a large scale financial institution that is actually using
    USDC for example to move money inside the institution across borders I'm not up
    to kill this again a lot of 90% and the fee to say that in some ways we need more
    than just programmable money we all feel good rails to be enterprise grade so
    one of the things that that circle is doing is we're reading the CPMI IOSCO paper
    we're reading stuff from the BIS and we're saying what are the barriers to large
    enterprise use of of blockchains saying that we can actually make program ability
    really effective and so we're developing something called ARC which is sort of
    an enterprise grates L1 blockchain that has you know sub-second deterministic
    finality that that makes it very you know you send the money boom it's done you
    don't have to wait there's no probability there's no 51 percent attack concern
    using something that's very stable like a USDC as gas and other features as well
    including privacy layers so it's just very important to say you you got to combine
    the programmability with the with the underlying infrastructure as well to really
    unlock these use cases the I can just jump in on that one I think there's a lot
    to be done here I think one point of encouragement for anybody who is building
    like we have a fairly sizable business essentially selling software like subscription
    software to corporates to automate payment workflows about a third of the total
    revenue the bank does annually now is attached to people who utilize software
    to eliminate some manual staff whether it's recon or payment scheduling otherwise
    there's a lot you can do with programmability that is technically better than
    people using bill pay services to schedule a payment right but it has to be much
    better in order for people to change the behavior like the law of good enough
    works against any new technology because if the existing method works well and
    it doesn't cost much and especially on the consumer side of the equation most
    payment initiation is free in the US you have to be able to demonstrate some significantly
    better value so demonstrating programmability showing people hey you can program
    the payments so that it moves consistent with you know your payment contract is
    not meaningfully better than just pre-programming you know you're whatever sourcing
    software you're using to initiate an ACH instruction at the point in time when
    you've hit the date that payment is due you have to actually focus on the integration
    right that is the place where you can improve a step so instead of having to pass
    contracts and have somebody sitting you know in a bullpen somewhere work in a
    P file that there are agreements that are standardized at the time of the procurement
    that then pass straight through to the financial institution or the wallet provider
    that then automated just that's the step we're going to have to take here because
    just because we can doesn't mean anybody will so just saying is there's a change
    that I think we have a follow on here for you um what's actually production already

    large firms like a PayPal which launched a stablecoin several years ago and they
    were one of the first to come out and say they want to launch it at being a scaled
    financial institution we don't want to call the ask you welcome and and add only
    we come trapped by their real fintech company really huge in terms of their scale
    and they launched a stablecoin and that's an example of someone being able to
    take this technology and be able to they don't want to be called tradify on the
    traditional system and be able to try to solve problems in a way that you couldn't
    know that word that's how I look at what it can happen here nobody knows next
    a going key to you got a solo one what are some programmable future features maybe
    things like allowless conditional transfers and others that are going to make
    stables invisible in workflows in the next six to twelve months hopefully we can
    overcome some of these challenges yeah the the whole goal I was thinking about
    this the other day and I remember about 20 years ago you would talk to someone
    a family member and you'd say well up we should go out we get we should buy this
    thing and someone would say well I'm going to go on the internet and buy it right
    we don't say that anymore we just buy it it's just assumed and so we're going
    to get to a point where stablecoins themselves are just floating around like any
    other form of electronic money like credit cards debit cards some most of which
    are by the way are not legal tender and so what are some of the programmable use
    cases that sort of we're thinking about you know circle is focused on all use
    cases but particularly thinking about enterprises right and so I'm often overseas
    I'm talking to let's just say a Korean manufacturer who wants to sell goods overseas
    to Latin America it takes five days for the money to move and sometimes takes
    it you know is extremely costly so you can imagine a scenario where all of this
    is built in and the moment the goods leave the factory floor through smart contract
    technology and program ability the money is automatically sent or when it's received
    on the other end so a trade finance and just trade in general is something that
    could be supercharged through stablecoins and the program program the program
    ability that that it offers another thing we're we're seeing is treasury functions
    right and even for scale financial institutions we have a large scale financial
    institution that is actually using USDC for example to move money inside the institution
    across borders I'm not up to kill this again a lot of 90% and the fee to say that
    in some ways we need more than just programmable money we all feel good rails
    to be enterprise grade so one of the things that that circle is doing is we're
    reading the CPMI IOSCO paper we're reading stuff from the BIS and we're saying
    what are the barriers to large enterprise use of of blockchains saying that we
    can actually make program ability really effective and so we're developing something
    called ARC which is sort of an enterprise grates L1 blockchain that has you know
    sub-second deterministic finality that that makes it very you know you send the
    money boom it's done you don't have to wait there's no probability there's no
    51 percent attack concern using something that's very stable like a USDC as gas
    and other features as well including privacy layers so it's just very important
    to say you you got to combine the programmability with the with the underlying
    infrastructure as well to really unlock these use cases the I can just jump in
    on that one I think there's a lot to be done here I think one point of encouragement
    for anybody who is building like we have a fairly sizable business essentially
    selling software like subscription software to corporates to automate payment
    workflows about a third of the total revenue the bank does annually now is attached
    to people who utilize software to eliminate some manual staff whether it's recon
    or payment scheduling otherwise there's a lot you can do with programmability
    that is technically better than people using bill pay services to schedule a payment
    right but it has to be much better in order for people to change the behavior
    like the law of good enough works against any new technology because if the existing
    method works well and it doesn't cost much and especially on the consumer side
    of the equation most payment initiation is free in the US you have to be able
    to demonstrate some significantly better value so demonstrating programmability
    showing people hey you can program the payments so that it moves consistent with
    you know your payment contract is not meaningfully better than just pre-programming
    you know you're whatever sourcing software you're using to initiate an ACH instruction
    at the point in time when you've hit the date that payment is due you have to
    actually focus on the integration right that is the place where you can improve
    a step so instead of having to pass contracts and have somebody sitting you know
    in a bullpen somewhere work in a P file that there are agreements that are standardized
    at the time of the procurement that then pass straight through to the financial
    institution or the wallet provider that then automated just that's the step we're
    going to have to take here because just because we can doesn't mean anybody will
    so just saying is there's a change that I think we have a follow on here for you
    um what's actually production already now for enterprises and specifically around
    things like illicit activity attention and where false positives are going to
    buy this yeah so so the whole area of making sure you're on something that's trusted
    right is just is many ways critical for enterprise adoption right and enterprise
    is going to feel is is going to be extremely hesitant to risk its reputation to
    go on a blockchain where potentially North Korea is a validator right and so there
    are a number of like that that we're taking into account so for example arc the
    blockchain that we're creating will actually have permission validators so everyone
    will be better than in advance and and also making sure that that the institution
    that you're getting the digital assets from has an AML CTF program it's compliant
    with the Patriot Act all of those things matter the good old Patriot Act are going
    to interoperability and orchestration this one's for all of y'all so if you'll
    feel free to jump in keep a clean out there boys and where is interop already
    good enough and where is it brittle what orchestration layer or layers are going
    to enable a truly tech agnostic experience actually I can get started from the
    consumer standpoint at in this it's not so expensive to maintain some liquidity
    buffers to orchestrate because even today like it's it's still pretty aggregated
    like the question is what happens if we end up in one of these like ridiculous
    situations where it's so atomized know that that but right now my you know from
    the consumer standpoint I would say we don't see that being a big issue you need
    to hold some liquidity buffers but but again no like you don't we have effects
    exposure you have some credit risk that need to manage but we have an encounter
    that being a big problem okay can you just see like on the on the scale side how
    do you guys perceive you know that but on our end it has made a big deal I given
    the interest that we expressed on cross-border payments it's the on-ramps and
    the off-ramps it's the point you made earlier about the need to cobble together
    your own ecosystem if you want to move money utilizing stablecoins today the actual
    use of the rail is much easier than getting money in and then getting it out in
    another jurisdiction ensuring that the person that you're paying is the ability
    to accept it and to convert it back to fiat and I my big fear like I think there
    are lots of really interesting things that can be done with tokenized deposits
    but that's the place where I think the interoperability issues the biggest if
    we can land on a handful of call it standard stable coin payment rails I don't
    know that interoperability some problems so much as it is just getting to a point
    where the adoption on both sides of the network on the send and the receive side
    are native supposed to through a third party and then a transfer we're a bit of
    a strange inner regnum where the genus act has passed but and you can be a forward
    looking genius compliant but you aren't genius compliant today and and so that's
    actually create a huge proliferation of stablecoin issuers from a white label
    side and otherwise and so I actually think if you had a moment of risk where something
    could go wrong it's probably now between now and 18 months from now because you
    have so many different firms that are operating in ways that may or may not end
    up looking like they've aged well but I do think that once genius comes into effect
    when the rules are put into place and everyone is I have to follow them which
    I guess gets you all the way to three years from when it passed you're going to
    have a clear set of rules and that should create a level of fungibility that can
    be relied upon as long as you know the standards are widely enforced and I think
    also adopted in a number of different international jurisdictions so that you
    create this capacity where it is truly cash and cash equivalents and I think that's
    where we'll go and so between blockchain and standards you do create a capacity
    to have interoperability in a forward looking basis you don't today because stablecoins
    still have counterparty rest of them depending on exactly how they're constructed
    most of them still do and certainly a lot of the new ones also do as well and
    so that's where there's a real interesting dynamic that exists right now I think
    that also and this is really I think Tim's point there is a lot of complexity
    around having to be able to manage that liquidity because those are not the same
    liabilities they're almost in some ways akin though not the exact same thing as
    a deposit because you know you have the counterparty risk related to them I think
    that'll all get worked out over time and you know we'll get to that end state
    where I think that will lessen maybe either the capital they might have to hold
    against a stablecoins the amount of risk limits that you would have to put into
    place the counterparty capital charges that you might need to carry but I don't
    think we're there yet so we're getting there but there's a lot more work to be
    done yet maybe you asked about orchestration I think and this goes to sort of
    Tim's point about sort of not not unsolving problems that have been solved you
    know a lot of the domestic payment system works rather well there there are obviously
    improvements that can be made but once you step outside you as borders it becomes
    a lot more complex so one example of orchestration is something we've created
    called the circle payments network where we have institutions on various sides
    that orchestrating effects flows using what governor waller has called the stablecoin
    sandwich but right now to send money to to Brazil from the United States or from
    the European Union of the United States it can take up to 72 hours going through
    various correspondent bank accounts we've been able to get that down to 72 seconds
    using basically fiat on either end and then the stablecoin rails in between so
    it's a great example of where orchestration as you as you ask the question actually
    can make a difference to solve a problem that is a real barrier to use case the
    other point I just want to think about is tokenized deposits we've mentioned it
    a couple of times there's a couple lines in the genius act that just gives a scant
    reference to it but this country has never really thought about tokenized deposits
    and the potential impact on the banking system and as a former regulator myself
    I'd ask the question I think you used the term it used 490 in 996 banks in the
    United States yeah if in fact 5,000 banks in the United States many of which are
    communities smaller banks immediately overnight tokenized their deposits they
    moved at the speed of the internet 24-7 as a bank regulator I might be a little
    concerned about that right and so I think if we are going to go down the road
    of tokenized deposits unlike stablecoins that are back one to one with very high
    quality liquid assets if we're using the fractional reserve banking system which
    is subject to deposit insurance the discount window and essentially a government
    intervention model and we're going to tokenize that and move it quickly through
    blockchains I think more public policy work should be done.
  type: recommendation
- actionable: true
  confidence: medium
  extracted: just get about prohibiting people from paying interest whether they call
    it rewards uh or anything else right all right speaking of yield-bearing stablecoins
    heath this one's for you but another seal for to jump in uh why should or shouldn't
    we have regulated yield-bearing stablecoins in the United States well the answer
    is we do they're called tokenized money market funds and so uh that's the circle
    position is that a stable coin is the effect of the the the equivalent of cash
    uh we think the genius act got it right um back one for one anytime you're you're
    you're paying out and it's uh paying out interest that obviously introduces more
    risk but that said we do think there's a need obviously for interest bearing uh
    interest in interest bearing digital collateral and so we've created it's not
    available in the United States but something called USYC which does precisely
    that but circles always take in the position that it's a security it's a tokenized
    money market fund and so I think those distinctions make a great deal of sense
    and they're consistent with current law including the Genius Act great answer
    we already have it so you close my long I think we've actually made it through
    all of the questions uh I think we're probably coming in on time as well so 200

    in their drew you do a really good job uh John Dalton really if you just get in

summary: '## Comprehensive Summary of Podcast Episode: 🚨LIVE: Federal Reserve PUMPING
  CRYPTO, BITCOIN & DEFI


  This 159-minute live broadcast centered on the critical intersection of traditional
  finance (TradFi), digital assets, and decentralized finance (DeFi), featuring speakers
  from major financial infrastructure providers and blockchain technology leaders,
  broadcasting from an event involving Federal Reserve governors. The core narrative
  focused on the necessity of **interoperability** between legacy systems and emerging
  blockchain technology to unlock efficiency, security, and financial inclusion.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus was the **integration of digital assets and DeFi protocols with
  regulated financial institutions (TradFi)**. Key themes included:

  *   **Interoperability:** Connecting existing systems (like SWIFT) with various
  blockchain networks (Ethereum, Solana, etc.).

  *   **Infrastructure Modernization:** Discussing the technological and procedural
  changes required within banks to handle real-time, data-rich digital asset transactions.

  *   **Custody and Wallet Technology:** Contrasting traditional custody models with
  blockchain-native solutions like MPC/threshold signatures.

  *   **Regulatory Compliance:** Addressing the challenges of applying existing compliance,
  accounting, and record-keeping requirements to decentralized systems.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Two Dimensions of Interoperability:** The discussion highlighted the need
  to synchronize (1) existing systems (data, backends, messaging standards like SWIFT)
  with chains, and (2) fragmented Layer 1 chains with each other via standardized
  protocols.

  *   **Blockchain as Native Books & Records:** Unlike traditional finance where custody
  involves storing physical assets or managing centralized ledgers, in crypto, the
  Layer 1 blockchain *is* the books and records; custody providers focus on securely
  managing the private keys/passwords that authorize movement.

  *   **Enhanced Security via MPC/Threshold Signatures:** Modern digital asset custody
  utilizes multi-signature or threshold signature schemes (often via Multi-Party Computation)
  to distribute key ownership, significantly increasing resiliency against cybersecurity
  and counterparty risks compared to single-key systems.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Coexistence, Not Replacement:** The immediate future is not blockchain replacing
  traditional systems, but rather the two coexisting and interconnecting, layering
  digital asset innovation onto proven financial rails.

  *   **Institutional DeFi Appetite:** Significant appetite for integrating DeFi is
  emerging from large FinTechs (like Stripe, Revolut) that already manage millions
  of crypto users and seek to leverage DeFi protocols (like Aave, Uniswap) for better
  client returns via secure APIs.

  *   **FedNow vs. Digital Rails:** Traditional systems like FedNow offer 24/7/365
  real-time payments today, creating a competitive debate for large institutions on
  which rail (TradFi or digital asset infrastructure) offers superior cost and speed
  advantages.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Chainlink (Sergey):** Highlighted their role in building the **Cross-Chain
  Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)**, essential for synchronizing existing systems
  with chains and connecting fragmented blockchains.

  *   **BNY Mellon (Jennifer Barker):** Representing a major infrastructure bank,
  she emphasized their commitment to modernizing treasury services, investing in AI
  for fraud control, and integrating digital asset custody with traditional rails.

  *   **Fireblocks (Michael):** Discussed the evolution of custody technology, focusing
  on the shift to MPC/threshold signatures and the complexity of integrating these
  new security models into legacy bank IT systems built in the 70s/80s/90s.

  *   **SWIFT, DTCC, Ava Labs (Ava Arc):** Mentioned as key players in existing infrastructure
  or early institutional DeFi integration efforts.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Need for Clear Frameworks:** Speakers expressed enthusiasm for the SEC and
  CFTC moving toward clearer regulatory directions, which will simplify the complex
  "hybrid system" required over the next 2-5 years.

  *   **Compliance is the Hurdle:** The biggest challenge in bridging DeFi and TradFi
  is ensuring that cross-chain or on-chain transactions meet stringent requirements
  for accounting, books and records, and KYC/AML compliance.

  *   **Global Standards:** The importance of global standards like **ISO 20022**
  was stressed for ensuring data richness and consistency across disparate payment
  systems.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a phase where digital asset innovation is embedded
  within regulated frameworks. This requires massive IT process overhauls within banks—moving
  away from batch processing to near-instantaneous change management (e.g., handling
  Ethereum forks within 60 minutes). The next 2-5 years will be defined by creating
  these compliant, interoperable hybrid systems.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This discussion is most valuable for **Financial Technology Professionals, Institutional
  Investors, Compliance Officers, Bank IT/Strategy Leaders, and Blockchain Architects**
  focused on enterprise adoption and regulatory compliance within the digital asset
  space.'
