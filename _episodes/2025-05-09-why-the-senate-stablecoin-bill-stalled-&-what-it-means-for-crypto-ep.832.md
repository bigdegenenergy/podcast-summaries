    we want to keep the process going because if it turns out that we can't even get

    that we should have similar definitions across both bills. So if you look at the

    that actually passes is the definition that can be used in market structure, right?

summary: "## Podcast Summary: Why the Senate Stablecoin Bill Stalled & What It Means\
  \ for Crypto - Ep.832\n\nThis bonus episode of *Unchained* discusses the recent\
  \ procedural failure of the Senate's stablecoin legislation, known as the **Genius\
  \ Act**, and analyzes the political maneuvering and policy disagreements causing\
  \ the stall. Host Laura Shin is joined by Kristen Smith (CEO of the Blockchain Association)\
  \ and Amanda Tumennelli (Executive Director and CLO of the DeFi Education Fund).\n\
  \n### 1. Focus Area\nThe primary focus is the **U.S. Senate's legislative process**\
  \ concerning **stablecoin regulation** (specifically the Genius Act), the political\
  \ dynamics causing the procedural setback, and the implications for broader crypto\
  \ market structure legislation.\n\n### 2. Key Technical Insights\n*   **Definition\
  \ Scoping Risk:** Concerns were raised regarding the definition of \"Digital Asset\
  \ Service Provider\" (DASP) in the bill, which could inadvertently scope in and\
  \ impose unworkable Anti-Money Laundering (AML) obligations on core blockchain technology\
  \ components, potentially harming the underlying infrastructure.\n*   **Need for\
  \ Definitional Consistency:** The experts stressed the importance of ensuring consistent\
  \ definitions (e.g., for \"permitted payment stablecoin\") across both the stablecoin\
  \ bill and any forthcoming market structure legislation to avoid regulatory confusion\
  \ in the industry.\n\n### 3. Market/Investment Angle\n*   **Process Over Perfection:**\
  \ The consensus is that keeping the legislative process alive is paramount, even\
  \ if the initial text contains flaws, because failure to pass a simple stablecoin\
  \ bill severely jeopardizes the chances of passing more complex market structure\
  \ legislation later.\n*   **Regulatory Clarity as a Precursor:** Successful passage\
  \ of the stablecoin bill is viewed as a critical prerequisite for establishing a\
  \ foundational regulatory framework necessary for broader market structure reform\
  \ to follow.\n*   **Deadline Pressure:** Congressional deadlines, such as the August\
  \ recess, are powerful tools that force compromises and could ultimately drive a\
  \ deal on the legislation.\n\n### 4. Notable Companies/People\n*   **The Genius\
  \ Act (S. 394/S. 1582):** The specific stablecoin legislation under discussion.\n\
  *   **Senator John Thune (R-SD):** Senate Majority Leader whose \"no\" vote on the\
  \ motion to proceed allows him to bring the motion back for reconsideration once\
  \ a deal is struck.\n*   **Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) & Senator Angela Alsobrook\
  \ (D-MD):** Co-sponsors of the original committee-approved bill who are actively\
  \ involved in behind-the-scenes negotiations.\n*   **Blockchain Association & DeFi\
  \ Education Fund:** Industry advocacy groups actively engaging with lawmakers on\
  \ the technical nuances of the bill.\n\n### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion\n* \
  \  **Procedural Roadblock:** The vote failed because Democrats united to block the\
  \ *motion to proceed* (which requires 60 votes to limit debate), falling short by\
  \ about 12 votes. This was not a vote on the bill's substance.\n*   **The Two Genius\
  \ Acts:** Confusion arose because Republican authors introduced a new version (S.\
  \ 1582) using a procedural tool (Rule 14) to incorporate changes quickly, which\
  \ Democrats viewed as a process failure since they were committed to the original\
  \ committee version (S. 394).\n*   **Points of Contention:** Key sticking points\
  \ include:\n    *   Concerns over potential conflicts of interest related to **Donald\
  \ Trump's family involvement** in crypto businesses.\n    *   Republican concerns\
  \ regarding **Big Tech entering the stablecoin business** (e.g., Facebook/Meta).\n\
  \    *   Technical disagreements over **AML definitions** and their impact on blockchain\
  \ technology.\n*   **Proposed Solutions:** Democrats have proposed separate legislation\
  \ (like the MIMIC Act) to address potential conflicts of interest involving elected\
  \ officials, though adding such provisions could become a \"poison pill\" for the\
  \ White House.\n\n### 6. Future Implications\nThe experts remain cautiously optimistic\
  \ that negotiations will continue, likely resuming in the coming weeks before Memorial\
  \ Day or being bundled into larger end-of-year packages. The industry must remain\
  \ aligned to ensure the final text protects core blockchain technology while establishing\
  \ necessary regulatory guardrails. The outcome of this bill will heavily influence\
  \ the feasibility of passing subsequent market structure legislation.\n\n### 7.\
  \ Target Audience\n**Crypto Policy Professionals, Blockchain Industry Executives,\
  \ Lobbyists, and Institutional Investors** who need to track the immediate legislative\
  \ hurdles and political risks associated with U.S. stablecoin regulation."
