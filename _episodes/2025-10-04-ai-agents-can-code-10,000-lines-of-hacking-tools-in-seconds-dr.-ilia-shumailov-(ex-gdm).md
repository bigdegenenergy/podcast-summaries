  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We have written a whole new branch of literature on what we call like architectural
    backdoors, where you don't actually hide malicious functionality in parameters

    a structure, so that even if you find you in the model, it still has the same
    baseline behavior.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: AI Agents Can Code 10,000 Lines of Hacking Tools In
  Seconds - Dr. Ilia Shumailov (ex-GDM)


  This 61-minute episode features Dr. Ilia Shumailov, formerly of DeepMind''s machine
  learning security team, discussing the profound and often alarming security implications
  arising from the rapid advancement of AI agents. The core narrative moves from the
  fundamental differences between classical software security and securing agentic
  systems, to proposing novel, ML-based solutions for trusted computation that bypass
  traditional cryptography.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **AI Security and Agentic Systems**, specifically addressing
  the novel threat landscape posed by highly capable AI agents, the inadequacy of
  current security paradigms (both safety and classical security) to handle them,
  and the potential for ML models to serve as *trusted third parties* for private
  computation.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Shift in Adversarial Failure Modes:** Modern, large models fail in fundamentally
  different ways than older models. While they are more robust against traditional
  gradient-based adversarial examples, they become significantly more susceptible
  to instruction following failures, where simple phrasing can force them into unintended,
  malicious behavior (e.g., indirect prompt injection leading to task deviation).

  *   **Agents as Extreme Adversaries:** AI agents surpass even the "worst-case" human
  adversary (like an irrational child) because they can operate 24/7, touch every
  endpoint, possess near-infinite knowledge synthesis capabilities, and can generate
  massive amounts of complex code (e.g., 10,000 lines of hacking tools) instantly.

  *   **ML for Trusted Computation (The "Camel" Framework):** Shumailov proposes using
  ML models as verifiable, resettable "trusted third parties" to solve problems like
  the Millionaire Problem without relying on complex, expensive cryptography. This
  is achieved by defining strict, formally verifiable control flow and data flow policies
  *around* the model execution, rather than trying to enforce them *within* the model
  weights (e.g., the Camel system).


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Security Tooling Overhaul:** The current security tooling ecosystem, built
  for human-vs-human threats, is obsolete against agentic fleets. There is an urgent,
  unmet market need for new security tooling that imposes constraints and guarantees
  on agent behavior and data interaction.

  *   **Personalized Agents and Data Control:** The future involves personalized AI
  agents. Businesses and individuals need solutions that allow these agents to interact
  with sensitive data (like a passport number) only under strictly defined, verifiable
  conditions (e.g., only interacting with a `.gov.uk` domain), necessitating new access
  control and orchestration layers.

  *   **The Alchemy of Large Models:** The increasing size and capability of models
  make them opaque ("alchemy"). Discerning whether changes improve or degrade security/performance
  requires extensive, long-term experimentation, highlighting the difficulty in managing
  proprietary, large-scale deployments.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Dr. Ilia Shumailov:** Former DeepMind ML security researcher, now building
  new security tooling to address agentic risks.

  *   **Ross Anderson:** Legendary security academic (Shumailov''s PhD advisor at
  Cambridge), whose background emphasizes the adversarial nature of security.

  *   **DeepMind:** Mentioned as the location where Shumailov worked on defending
  models like Gemini against prompt injections.

  *   **Camel System:** The proposed framework developed by Shumailov’s team for enforcing
  security policies via formal semantics applied to the agent''s execution graph.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a paradigm where security is enforced **externally**
  via formal, language-based orchestration layers (like Camel) that manage data flow
  and tool usage, rather than relying on the inherent safety or alignment of the underlying
  LLM. The concept of a "trusted third party" is shifting from purely cryptographic
  constructs to verifiable, constrained ML inference engines.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  **AI/ML Engineers, Cybersecurity Professionals (especially those dealing with emerging
  threats), CTOs, and Investors** focused on enterprise AI adoption and risk mitigation.
  Professionals who understand the difference between safety (average case) and security
  (worst case) will find the distinctions particularly relevant.'
