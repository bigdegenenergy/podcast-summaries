- impact_reason: 'Provides a crucial current macro assessment: most crypto (altcoins)
    is treated as a risk asset, not a safe haven, during uncertainty.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Broadly speaking on the macro side, for the time being, crypto is viewed very
    much as a risk-on asset. So, if you're going to de-risk broadly, you're also de-risking
    crypto. Bitcoin might be a little bit the exception, but definitely altcoins are
    sort of not in favor generally speaking when you think about the entire macro
    space because there's a lot of uncertainty, right?

    about that.
  topic: Investment/Adoption

    advantage held by Asian jurisdictions over the US, which suffers from ambiguity
    despite recent positive sentiment shifts.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: one of the main issues with the US, and we've talked about this a lot, it's
    not just friendliness to crypto or lack of friendliness to crypto; it's a lack
    of regulatory clarity, right? And that's something that Asia generally has.
  topic: Regulation
- impact_reason: Provides a concrete example of the divergence in regulatory philosophy
    between the US (treating NFTs as potential securities) and parts of Asia (favoring
    industry self-regulation for NFTs).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced

    They went after Stoner Cats, and they went after Yoga, and went after OpenSea,
    whereas in Asia, they didn't do any of that.

    economies: crypto as a direct pathway to new income and international economic
    access, not just speculation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: places like the Philippines and Indonesia, for instance, and Malaysia, are
    fast adopting because they essentially are—Vietnam, for instance—because it essentially

    what do we actually need this for other than trading and speculation?
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Directly links the Terra/Luna collapse to a significant chilling
    effect on DeFi adoption and on-chain building within the Korean market.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Terra Luna was probably the biggest potential sort of DeFi play from a Korean
    perspective, and its spectacular collapse and everything else that, of course,
    we all know about. It sort of scared a lot of people from this idea of building
    on-chain.
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: 'Pinpoints a specific regulatory hurdle in Japan: restrictive reserve
    investment rules that kill the business model for JPY-backed stablecoins, favoring
    USD-backed ones.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: For example, there's—this is again in the regulation—if you're a JPY stablecoin,
    there are certain restrictions on how you can sort of invest the reserve assets,
    and it basically has to be in bank deposits, and that's basically no interest.
    So, there's not really a business model there...

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: How Asia''s Crypto Communities View the Tariffs
  and Trump''s Embrace of Crypto


  This 81-minute episode of *Unchained* features host Laura Shin interviewing **Emily
  Parker** (China and Japan advisor at the Global Blockchain Business Council) and
  **Yet** (CIO/Chairman of Annamoka Brands) to discuss the geopolitical and regulatory
  impact of US tariffs and the shifting stance of the Trump administration on crypto,
  specifically as viewed from key Asian hubs like Hong Kong, Japan, and China.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **intersection of US-Asia geopolitics (specifically tariffs)
  and the cryptocurrency/Web3 landscape**. Key themes include:

  *   Asian market reactions to potential US tariffs, particularly concerning China.

  *   The perceived impact of the Trump administration''s increasingly crypto-friendly
  stance on Asian regulatory environments and market sentiment.

  *   The role of Hong Kong as a crucial proxy for China''s engagement with global
  blockchain policy.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **China''s Crypto Status Nuance:** The common media trope that crypto is "banned"
  in China is inaccurate. While trading is prohibited, *owning* Bitcoin is not a crime,
  and trading activity persists. China''s true stance is revealed through its strategic
  use of Hong Kong for policy experimentation (e.g., stablecoin regulation, exchange
  licensing).

  *   **Blockchain as Strategic Infrastructure:** Chinese leadership (Xi Jinping)
  has signaled that blockchain and Web3 are strategically important, suggesting a
  focus on the underlying technology rather than immediate acceptance of decentralized
  crypto trading.

  *   **Regulatory Arbitrage Shift:** Jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Singapore previously
  benefited from regulatory arbitrage due to US hostility, but this dynamic is shifting
  as the US now actively competes to become the "crypto capital of the world."


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Crypto as Risk-On Asset:** Generally, in the current macro environment of
  uncertainty (including tariff discussions), crypto (especially altcoins) is viewed
  as a **risk-on asset**, leading to de-risking alongside broader macro concerns.

  *   **Bitcoin as Macro Hedge:** Despite the risk-on classification, there is a growing
  conversation in Hong Kong and Japan about adding Bitcoin to corporate balance sheets
  specifically as a **macro hedge** against potential dollar weakening caused by geopolitical
  tensions or tariffs.

  *   **Corporate Diversification:** Many large Asian businesses, particularly in
  manufacturing, had already diversified away from reliance on the US market years
  ago in anticipation of trade friction, putting them in a better position now.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Emily Parker & Yet:** Provided expert analysis based on their deep involvement
  in the Asian tech, policy, and investment ecosystems (Longhash, Annamoka Brands,
  advising Neom/Saudi Arabia).

  *   **Bitwise/Matt Hogan:** Mentioned via sponsorship for their CIO memo summarizing
  crypto market movements.

  *   **D-Sprad (Korea):** Noted for observing a direct, noticeable surge in Korean
  crypto market sentiment correlating with Trump''s election victory in late 2024.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Japan''s Tax Hurdle:** The single biggest obstacle to crypto adoption in Japan
  remains its high crypto tax rate (up to 55%), though there is serious discussion
  about lowering it toward the 20% rate applied to stocks, potentially paving the
  way for a Bitcoin ETF within the next two years.

  *   **US Influence on Asian Policy:** There is anecdotal evidence that the perceived
  shift toward crypto-friendliness in the US (under the Trump administration) is influencing
  regulatory conversations in Japan and potentially elsewhere.

  *   **Hong Kong''s Pro-Crypto Pivot:** Hong Kong''s aggressive pro-crypto stance
  is seen as being executed with the explicit blessing of Beijing, serving as a controlled
  mechanism for China to engage with global Web3 finance via the Hong Kong proxy.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward increased **geopolitical competition** for crypto
  talent and capital, with the US actively trying to reclaim its leadership position.
  This competition is forcing Asian hubs to refine their regulatory frameworks (e.g.,
  Japan lowering taxes, Hong Kong issuing licenses) to remain attractive. The conversation
  around Bitcoin as a legitimate macro hedge is gaining traction among institutional
  players in Asia.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto/Web3 Professionals, Institutional Investors,
  Geopolitical Analysts, and Policy Makers** interested in understanding how global
  trade tensions directly influence regional crypto adoption and regulatory strategy.'
