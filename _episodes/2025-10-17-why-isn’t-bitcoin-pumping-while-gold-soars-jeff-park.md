    of the Bank of England and the potential future 'nationalization' or integration
    of Bitcoin into sovereign finance due to debt pressures.

    US government actually acquired a bunch of Bitcoin, but eventually needs to borrow
    more than it can and needs to start pledging Bitcoin somewhere to borrow that
    money. And then the debt actually then becomes kind of larger than anything that
    it can be paid back for. And then it becomes kind of like nationalized in the
    construct of like the role of that asset. And that's like almost like the central
    bank of Bitcoin that you can imagine in the arc of history.

    are absolutely related, which is why I think this notion of Fed independence too,
    we need to kind of move beyond it.

    Oh, you mean all the tribalism and battling and yeah, like when Bitcoiners fight
    other Bitcoiners about like the spam filter, for example, even if it's coming

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why Isn’t Bitcoin Pumping While Gold Soars?
  | Jeff Park


  This 41-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast, featuring Jeff Park (CIO at ProCat BTC),
  centers on a **macroeconomic analysis** explaining why Bitcoin is currently lagging
  behind gold despite favorable conditions for risk assets, and explores the evolving
  role of reserve assets in global finance.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion provided a **macro world tour** focusing on global financial plumbing,
  central bank interventions (specifically swap lines), the geopolitical tension between
  the US and China, and the comparative roles of **Gold and Bitcoin** as hedges against
  fiat currency instability and potential strategic reserve assets.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Swap Lines as Dollar Plumbing:** Cross-currency swap lines between central
  banks are the essential "plumbing" that ensures the flow of US dollars necessary
  to service the global dollarized economy during funding fractures.

  *   **SDRs vs. Bitcoin:** Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), an IMF invention based
  on a basket of major currencies, function as a neutral reserve asset and pledged
  collateral. Bitcoin is posited as a potential, more functional replacement for the
  SDR because it can be transactional, not just collateral.

  *   **B2B Use Case for Bitcoin:** The first major use case for Bitcoin as a true
  liquid currency may be at the **nation-state or B2B level** (e.g., pledging as pristine
  collateral for sovereign borrowing) rather than individual consumer purchases.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Gold''s Psychological Dominance:** Gold is currently outperforming because
  it is the most obvious and psychologically certain asset during global chaos and
  uncertainty, driven by retail flows and central bank accumulation (evidenced by
  rising warrants on the Shanghai Futures Exchange).

  *   **Lagging Bitcoin Participation:** Despite strong institutional adoption conduits
  and an expected rate-cut cycle, Bitcoin is frustratingly lagging gold, suggesting
  that central banks have not yet fully integrated Bitcoin into their reserve or collateral
  frameworks.

  *   **Liquidity Fuels Risk Assets:** General trends of increased credit creation
  and liquidity injection (both public and private sector, as seen in China’s regional
  liquidity reopening) remain fundamentally positive for risk assets.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jeff Park:** Chief Investment Officer at ProCat BTC, providing the expert
  macro and financial plumbing analysis.

  *   **Javier Milei (Argentina):** Mentioned as the leader implementing rapid, painful
  devaluation and austerity measures, whose success hinges on a convincing pro-growth
  narrative that has yet to materialize.

  *   **Bank of England:** Used as a historical case study showing how a central bank
  began as a private entity, managed gold reserves, and only became nationalized when
  government debt (debt-to-GDP) reached unsustainable levels (around 250%).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Argentine Peso Intervention:** The US Treasury intervened in Argentina using
  its **Exchange Stabilization Facility (ESF)**, which primarily holds Special Drawing
  Rights (SDRs) rather than just dollars, to buy pesos, highlighting the complex mechanics
  of sovereign financial backstops.

  *   **Trade War as Capital War:** Prolonged trade conflicts (like US/China) inevitably
  spill over into the capital account, forcing countries to negotiate terms related
  to fund flows and foreign investment privileges.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that the next major evolution for Bitcoin will involve
  its adoption as **pristine collateral** at the sovereign level, mirroring the historical
  arc of gold—moving from a private store of value to an asset integrated into the
  core plumbing of global finance and potentially leading to a form of "nationalization"
  or central bank integration.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Investors, Macro Analysts, and Institutional
  Finance Professionals** interested in the intersection of global monetary policy,
  geopolitical risk, and the long-term strategic positioning of Bitcoin relative to
  traditional safe-haven assets like gold.'
