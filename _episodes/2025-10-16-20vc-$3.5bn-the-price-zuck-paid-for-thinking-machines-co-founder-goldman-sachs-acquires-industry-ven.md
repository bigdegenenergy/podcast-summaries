    that founders will come out of everywhere.
  topic: Adoption/Business
- impact_reason: 'Provides a crucial market segmentation insight: the perceived narrative
    (political prediction markets) often overshadows the actual, more lucrative revenue
    driver (sports betting) in these platforms.'

  text: I think Roger Nielder, correctly, on what's going on here. This is two non-sports
    betting companies who are doing court prediction markets. What all we talk about
    is the 10% of the revenue that's political and 90% of their business is sports
    betting, but we're not calling it that.
  topic: Business/Adoption
- impact_reason: Offers an alternative, broader definition of 'king-making' as the
    formation of a well-funded oligopoly, which is highly relevant to understanding
    VC dynamics in emerging tech sectors.

  text: To me, king-making means something different. And to me, king-making doesn't
    need to be one company. Call it an oligopoly where a small group of companies
    that receive an exceptional amount of funding relative to everybody else.

    directly into superior spending on growth levers (marketing/distribution), which
    is the core of competitive advantage.'

    that's what makes these companies go around, is the ability to spend money on
    marketing.

    the regulators. And I think that's why, as I say, you should have a bias to regulating
    as little as possible, especially on economics, if at all possible.
  topic: Regulation/Strategy

    evolving, high-conviction areas like AI, broad diversification is merely a way
    to delay making a decision.
  relevance_score: 8

summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Pricing Options, Founder Loyalty, and M&A in Venture


  This episode of the 20VC podcast, featuring Harry Stebbings alongside venture veterans
  Jason Lampkin and Rory O''Driscoll, dives deep into recent high-profile transactions
  in the venture and asset management space, while also exploring philosophical shifts
  in founder incentives and loyalty.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus areas are **Venture Capital Strategy, Asset Management M&A, and
  Founder Economics/Incentives**. The discussion heavily centers on the valuation
  of private asset management firms, the implications of massive founder wealth creation,
  and the increasing transactional nature of the VC ecosystem.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  * **Valuation Multiples for Asset Managers:** The discussion established that fund-of-funds/secondary
  businesses like Industry Ventures typically trade at an **Enterprise Value of ~10%
  of AUM**, contrasting with primary managers (like KKR/Carlyle) trading closer to
  20% of AUM, and public asset managers trading at 1-2% of AUM.

  * **Monetizable vs. Non-Monetizable Businesses:** A key distinction was drawn between
  businesses built around a product/brand (like a media company or Y Combinator) which
  are highly monetizable via sale, versus pure venture funds whose primary asset is
  the **IQ of the partners**, making them difficult to sell 100%.

  * **Acqui-Hires at Scale:** The departure of the Thinking Machines co-founder for
  a massive payout highlights the trend of "asset purchases" where large sums are
  paid primarily for key talent/people, blurring the lines between traditional M&A
  and acqui-hires, especially in high-valuation AI companies.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  * **Goldman Sachs’ Private Asset Push:** Goldman Sachs acquiring Industry Ventures
  for up to $965M is seen as a strategic move to rapidly scale their private asset
  platform (Apex) for their Ultra-High-Net-Worth clients, capitalizing on the high
  fees associated with private markets versus public equities.

  * **The "Hunger" Dilemma for LPs:** Successful fund managers who have returned significant
  DPI (Distributions to Paid-In Capital) face scrutiny from LPs questioning if they
  are still "hungry" enough to manage subsequent funds, illustrating a persistent
  challenge in long-term LP/GP relationships.

  * **SoftBank’s AI Leverage:** SoftBank borrowing $5 billion against its ARM holding
  to invest further into OpenAI signals an aggressive strategy to double down on AI,
  leveraging its existing, highly valued assets to fuel new, high-conviction bets.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  * **Industry Ventures (Hans Morris):** Acquired by Goldman Sachs. Praised for building
  a highly productizable, fee-stream-driven asset management business (especially
  secondary funds) that was attractive for a 100% sale.

  * **Thinking Machines (Andrew Tulloch):** Co-founder who left the $2B+ company to
  join Matter for a reported $3.5B exit/opportunity, sparking a debate on founder
  loyalty versus unprecedented personal wealth realization.

  * **Arthur Rock:** Mentioned as an "OG" of seed investing, serving as a historical
  benchmark for direct, intimidating, and highly respected venture figures.

  * **OpenAI:** The target of SoftBank’s new leveraged investment strategy.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No specific regulatory discussions were highlighted, but the conversation touched
  upon **internal governance and founder protection mechanisms** (e.g., extended vesting,
  repurchase rights) as necessary responses to the observed transactional behavior
  of highly compensated founders.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is heading toward:

  1. **Increased Financialization of VC Firms:** More successful firms will seek to
  build monetizable, productized asset management arms (like Industry Ventures) rather
  than relying solely on partner deal flow.

  2. **Erosion of Founder Loyalty:** As personal wealth creation accelerates (evidenced
  by the $3.5B exit opportunity), investors must bake in stronger contractual protections
  against co-founder departures, treating it as a quantifiable risk factor.

  3. **AI-Driven Security:** The integration of AI threat detection (via sponsor Godio)
  is becoming essential for protecting high-net-worth individuals and tech professionals
  from sophisticated, AI-generated scams.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This podcast is most valuable for **Venture Capitalists (GPs), Limited Partners
  (LPs), Founders of high-growth technology companies, and professionals in Financial
  Services M&A.**'
