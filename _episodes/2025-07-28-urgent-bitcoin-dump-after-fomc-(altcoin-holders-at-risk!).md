    going to remain the same this week from the Federal Reserve FOMC.

    of emergency loans is going to have to be done to the tune of $9 trillion. So
    when you come to the crescendo of high interest rates with, you know, nearly $10
    trillion of emergency debt to refinance within the year, you have to pull back
    the rates a little bit just to be able to keep the Ponzi scheme going.

    I really think the knowledge base that we're building up right now is going to

    specific regulatory mechanisms (Dodd-Frank) that enable seizure or control over
    deposited funds.

    and then they'll just go in and take the money out of my bank account or your
    bank account or anyone's bank account that's still involved with this giant Ponzi
    scheme. They can take our money through the Dodd-Frank Act.

  text: September, we're expected to go to 4 to 4.25. And then December, I believe
    it should still be okay. Yeah. So December heavily weighted towards a 25 base

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: URGENT: Bitcoin DUMP After FOMC? (Altcoin Holders
  At Risk!)


  This 60-minute episode of Discover Crypto''s "Blockchain Basement Expoze," hosted
  by Druth Crypto, focused heavily on immediate market turbulence surrounding Bitcoin,
  the looming impact of the FOMC meeting, and broader macroeconomic factors, particularly
  former President Trump''s proposed global tariffs. The host provided technical analysis
  on Bitcoin''s current price range while cautioning viewers about high leverage and
  upcoming volatility.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus was **Cryptocurrency Market Analysis and Macroeconomic Impact**.
  Key themes included:

  *   **Bitcoin Price Action:** Analyzing short-term support/resistance zones ($114k
  support, $119.5k–$122k sell wall) and the significance of the current volume node.

  *   **Macroeconomic Shocks:** Discussing the market reaction to potential new global
  tariffs proposed by Donald Trump (15-20% range) and their implications for global
  trade and the US economy.

  *   **Federal Reserve Policy:** Anticipating the upcoming FOMC meeting, with a strong
  consensus that interest rates will remain unchanged, and discussing the pressure
  on the Fed regarding refinancing nearly $10 trillion in national debt.

  *   **Altcoin/DeFi Watch:** Briefly touching upon specific altcoins like Pepe, BNB,
  Solana, Pango, and Injective.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Volume Node Criticality:** Bitcoin is currently sitting directly at the main
  volume node for its current range, making this a crucial point of control determining
  whether the market holds or breaks down further.

  *   **High Open Interest Risk:** Bitcoin Open Interest reached an all-time high
  of $44.5 billion amid a price decline, signaling extreme leverage and increasing
  the risk of significant volatility and liquidations.

  *   **Liquidity Mapping:** Significant liquidity pockets exist just above the current
  price, particularly around $120,500, suggesting market makers have incentives to
  target these levels.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **FOMC Volatility Warning:** The host strongly advised viewers, especially active
  traders, to utilize **stop-losses** this week due to expected volatility surrounding
  the FOMC announcement, even though no rate cut is anticipated.

  *   **Altcoin Hype Cycle:** The host expressed a bullish sentiment regarding **Pepe**,
  suggesting it could capture the same level of meme coin liquidity and hype concentration
  in this cycle as Shiba Inu did previously.

  *   **Wall Street Inflow via Public Companies:** The massive $2.5 billion IPO set
  by Strategy (STRC) highlights significant Wall Street fundraising activity flowing
  into crypto-adjacent sectors, making stocks like **Circle (USDC)** and **Coinbase**
  attractive auxiliary plays.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump:** Mentioned for his proposed 15-20% global tariffs, which caused
  immediate market turbulence.

  *   **Jerome Powell/FOMC:** The central focus for monetary policy expectations this
  week (no rate cut expected).

  *   **GROC Analysis:** The host referenced data analysis from GROC regarding unusual
  engagement patterns on Crypto Twitter, humorously discussing which prominent figures
  (e.g., Lynn Alden, Mirad) might be "covert federal agents" (Feds).

  *   **Pepe & Shiba Inu:** Used as comparative examples for meme coin market dynamics.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion centered on **fiscal policy and debt management**. The host noted
  the government''s need to keep rates low to manage the refinancing of nearly $10
  trillion in emergency debt, suggesting this economic necessity will eventually force
  the Fed''s hand on rate cuts, regardless of inflation data. The discussion also
  touched on a bizarre case in China involving employees embezzling funds and laundering
  them through Bitcoin across multiple exchanges.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is entering a period of **heightened, leveraged
  volatility** driven by macroeconomic uncertainty (tariffs, debt refinancing pressure)
  and immediate technical events (FOMC). The long-term outlook remains bullish, particularly
  for those who build knowledge now, as the "whole world is waking up to crypto."
  The host emphasized that the dialogue from the FOMC meeting will set the precedent
  for the coming months, especially concerning future rate cut expectations in September
  and December.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Active Cryptocurrency Traders, Crypto Investors,
  and Macroeconomic Analysts** who need timely technical analysis combined with an
  understanding of how global political and monetary policy events directly influence
  digital asset prices.'
