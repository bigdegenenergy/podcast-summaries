summary: '## Comprehensive Summary: Smarter Compliance Through Transparent AI Deployment
  - with Miranda Jones of Emprise Bank


  This 19-minute podcast episode features Miranda Jones, Special Vice President and
  Data & AI Strategy Leader at Emprise Bank, discussing the critical need for a deliberate,
  collaborative, and transparent approach to deploying AI within regulated financial
  services, particularly concerning compliance and operational workflows. The central
  narrative emphasizes shifting focus from a "data gold rush" mentality to prioritizing
  high-quality, explainable outcomes built in partnership with frontline employees.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **AI deployment strategy in regulated financial services**,
  specifically focusing on:

  *   The necessity of **co-designing AI systems with frontline teams** (Subject Matter
  Experts or SMEs).

  *   The strategic value of **Explainable AI (XAI)** in building trust and accelerating
  adoption, rather than viewing it as a compliance hurdle.

  *   Cultural shifts required to move beyond measuring excessive data points toward
  defining and measuring **meaningful Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** aligned
  with core business goals.

  *   The strategic benefit of **slowing down initial scoping** to build reusable
  processes and shared ownership.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Explainability as an Accelerator:** Integrating explainability from Day 1
  speeds up final execution because it allows frontline staff to confidently use and
  communicate model decisions to customers and regulators, preventing adoption failure
  due to lack of trust or understanding.

  *   **Challenging Data Bias through Diversity:** Including diverse voices from frontline
  teams in the design process helps challenge potential biases in data selection,
  ensuring that the variables analyzed reflect true underlying patterns rather than
  narrow, biased customer lenses.

  *   **Focusing on True Outcome Correlation:** Teams often measure too many data
  points (a byproduct of the "data gold rush"). The technical focus should shift to
  identifying and measuring only the 4-5 data points *truly* indicative of progress
  toward the defined business outcome.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Employee Experience Drives Customer Experience:** If employees cannot understand
  or explain the AI-driven decisions they are tasked with executing, the system will
  fail organizationally. Investing in employee education and model transparency is
  the best path to superior customer experience.

  *   **Strategic Value of Deliberate Pacing:** The long-term advantage of slowing
  down to scope problems properly is the creation of **reusable processes** and the
  avoidance of reactive rework required when oversight, data dependencies, and usage
  are not documented upfront.

  *   **Data Quality over Data Quantity:** The industry is moving past the notion
  that "all data is the new oil." Banks must be thoughtful about which data truly
  correlates with desired outcomes, recognizing that not all data is created equal.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Miranda Jones (Emprise Bank):** Guest expert providing practical insights
  from a data science strategy leadership role within a regulated bank.

  *   **Emprise Bank:** The institutional context for the discussion, representing
  a regulated financial services environment.

  *   **Sears:** Sponsor of the special series on scaling AI.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is moving toward a phase of **mature, responsible
  AI adoption** where:

  1.  **Collaboration is mandatory:** Data science teams must deeply integrate with
  SMEs to bridge the gap between technical capability and operational reality.

  2.  **Transparency is non-negotiable:** Explainability will become a standard requirement,
  not an optional add-on, for successful deployment in high-stakes fields like finance.

  3.  **Pragmatism over Hype:** There is a growing acceptance that manual or paper-based
  processes may be strategically smarter than immediate, poorly scoped automation,
  especially when dealing with sensitive customer data and strict regulations.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI/ML Leaders, Data Science Managers, Compliance
  Officers, and Technology Strategy Executives** within highly regulated industries
  (especially Financial Services). It is also relevant for **FinTech vendors** seeking
  to understand the practical adoption hurdles faced by their banking clients.'
