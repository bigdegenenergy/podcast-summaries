  text: The problem with IMX is the token unlocks. Token unlocks. Maybe finally they
    quit selling. So IMX is one that's just like highly correlated to what the whales
    do because it all boils down to are they selling their token unlocks or they diamond
    handing the token unlocks?

summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - Aster (AST) is highlighted as the 'hottest altcoin' due to strong RSI readings
    and significant fundamental catalysts, including the development of its own Layer
    1 blockchain (Aster Chain).
  - The Aster Chain's key feature is enabling verifiable trades without revealing
    individual positions, which is seen as a major draw for large whale traders currently
    being 'hunted' on platforms like Hyperliquid.
  - Potential catalysts for Aster include ongoing discussions for a Binance listing
    and the CEO confirming plans for token buybacks to directly return value to the
    community.
  - Despite recent pumps, the host suggests caution on current entry points for Aster,
    advising potential buyers to start scaling in on a 20-25% decline, possibly starting
    around the $2 mark.
  - Bitcoin's NVRV Z-score suggests the current market is significantly undervalued
    compared to previous cycles, indicating that the parabolic rally phase has likely
    not yet begun.
  - Gold hitting a 45-year high on the monthly overbought level is presented as a
    historical indicator that often precedes a major Bitcoin pump.
  - The host notes that Aster's 24-hour trading volume and daily revenue are currently
    surpassing major competitors like Hyperliquid and even USDC, signaling high market
    interest.

    its recent price action and fundamental developments suggest it is poised for

    The host analyzes Bitcoin's current price stability using on-chain metrics like
    the NVRV score, concluding that the market has not yet topped out, while also
