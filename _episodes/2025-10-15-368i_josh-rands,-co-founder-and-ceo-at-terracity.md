summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: 368I\_Josh Rands, Co-Founder and CEO at TerraCity


  This episode of the "What is the Future for Cities" podcast features an in-depth
  conversation with **Josh Rands, Co-Founder and CEO of TerraCity**, focusing on integrating
  environmental sustainability with urban planning, particularly through the lens
  of transportation and land use, powered by AI modeling.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Urban Planning, Transportation Modeling, and Sustainability**.
  Key themes include defining the modern "city" (physical vs. digital community),
  the complex interplay between transportation and land use, the role of technology
  (specifically AI/ML) in informing public sector decision-making, and reframing sustainability
  through economic principles like **True Cost Accounting** and minimizing the **Green
  Premium**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **AI in Public Planning:** TerraCity is developing AI-powered modeling tools
  to help cities integrate complex data sets (transportation, land use, environmental
  factors) to inform comprehensive decision-making, moving beyond traditional planning
  processes.

  *   **Holistic Transportation Definition:** Transportation is defined not just by
  vehicle movement, but by the movement of people and goods necessary for daily life
  (work, errands, services), acknowledging both physical modes (car, transit, walking)
  and emerging digital modes (remote work/communication).

  *   **Quantifying Secondary Impacts:** A major technical opportunity lies in using
  data analytics and modeling to quantify the often-unmeasured secondary and tertiary
  benefits (e.g., social, environmental) of infrastructure projects like public transit,
  pulling these metrics into the planning process.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Innovation in Public Sector:** There is a growing trend of state DOTs and
  cities actively seeking and funding innovation programs, signaling a shift away
  from slow, traditional planning toward incorporating modern data analytics.

  *   **Financial Incentives for Sustainability:** Progress is accelerated when sustainable
  options become financially advantageous (low or zero "green premium"). Innovation
  should focus on driving down the cost of sustainable choices to incentivize behavioral
  change.

  *   **Risk and Public Sector:** Innovation in the public sector is inherently constrained
  by the duty to maintain quality and serve the public, meaning risk-taking must be
  managed carefully, unlike purely private sector innovation.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Josh Rands (TerraCity):** Co-founder and CEO, driving AI-powered modeling
  for integrated urban planning.

  *   **TerraCity:** The company developing the AI tools, named to reflect the necessary
  cohesion between the **Terra (Earth/Environment)** and the **City (Urbanism)**.

  *   **Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT):** Mentioned as an example of
  a public agency funding innovation programs, specifically looking at AI for first-last-mile
  access to new rail systems.

  *   **RethinkX (Adam Do, Richard Gale):** Mentioned in context regarding transformative
  change driven by cheaper, superior solutions creating financial incentives for behavioral
  shifts.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The future of cities hinges on successfully integrating environmental health with
  urban prosperity. This requires a shift from planning around single modes (like
  the car) to holistic, data-informed planning that accounts for land use, environmental
  impact, and community well-being. The successful application of AI in modeling these
  complex, multi-layered systems will be crucial for maximizing public investment
  returns and achieving long-term sustainability goals.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Urban Planners, Municipal Leaders, Transportation
  Engineers, Public Sector Technology Implementers, and Investors** focused on Smart
  Cities, Urban Tech, and ESG/Sustainability initiatives within the built environment.'
