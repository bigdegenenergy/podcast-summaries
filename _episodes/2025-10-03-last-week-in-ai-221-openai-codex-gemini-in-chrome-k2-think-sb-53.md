  text: their way of getting to better results, it's not just more parameters. It's
    actually thinking about scaling, it's using plan-before-you-think, prompt restructuring.
    We're just seeing this like time-to-compute, rethinking prompts, really, really
    trying to think of it almost as having different agents be able to think through
    different prompts and servicing the best ideas come up as now one of the best
    ways to improve reasoning.

    detection as a supervisory signal to generate scalable training data, bridging
    imitation learning and full RL.

  text: Having the self-improvement basically is almost like a simplified reinforcement
    learning without needing to do reinforcement learning fully where you only get
    supervision from the rewards itself. Now you can just predict the reward function
    and detect the success and use that to supervise and be able to get more trainable
    data in order to scale up their models.

summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - OpenAI has released GPT-4 Codex, aiming to compete more effectively with tools
    like Cloud Code, potentially gaining users due to recent Anthropic inference issues.
  - Google is embedding Gemini directly into Chrome, signaling the mainstream adoption
    of integrated AI assistants within web browsers, following trends set by Perplexity.
  - Humanoid robotics startups like Figure AI ($1B raised, $39B valuation) and China's
    Unitree (planning IPO) are attracting massive investment, driving down the cost
    of general-purpose hardware.
  - Tesla's robotaxi testing in Nevada is underway, but the company faces scrutiny
    from the NHTSA over potential misreporting of three recent accidents.
  - Amazon's Zoox has launched a public, driverless robotaxi service on the Las Vegas
    strip using its unique, inward-facing vehicle design.
  - Replit experienced explosive revenue growth, jumping from $2.8M to $150M ARR in
    less than a year, leading to a $3B valuation.
  - New research introduced K2-Think, a parameter-efficient reasoning model, and LocalBench,
    a more realistic benchmark for testing LLMs on long-context software engineering
    tasks.
  overview: This episode of Last Week in AI covers significant updates across the
    AI landscape, including OpenAI upgrading Codex with GPT-4 capabilities and Google
    integrating Gemini directly into the Chrome browser. The discussion also heavily
    features advancements in robotics, with major funding rounds for humanoid startups
    like Figure AI and Unitree, alongside new research in self-improving embodied
    models and physics simulation.
