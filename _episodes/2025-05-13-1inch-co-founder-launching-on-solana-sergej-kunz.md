    some, I don't know, more than half maybe of like SOLUSD swaps, SOLUSD swap on
    Jupiter, and maybe even on Solana in general. And it basically is just this in-house
    designed DEX, and some are pointing to this like the rise of prop DEXes is basically
    where you don't open source the code, but you use maybe more TradFi, sophisticated
    market-making strategies, and you just get much better prices than what you can
    achieve with like an AMM or something like that.

  text: If you don't blockchain architecture is different differently. Our available
    chain, Intempest Swap Protocol, is off-chain based on signing messages and sharing
    it through different servers to the resolvers, to the market makers. At Solana,
    we came to the point that we cannot do off-chain signing and sharing the order
    if everyone doesn't work because they need to deposit in an account in Solana.
    We had to learn to work again on Solana. We had to rethink everything, to change
    the architecture.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: 1inch Co-Founder: Launching On Solana | Sergej
  Kunz


  This 45-minute episode features an in-depth discussion between host Jack Cumanek
  and Sergej Kunz, Co-founder of the DeFi protocol **1inch**, focusing on their recent
  expansion from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem to **Solana**. The core
  narrative revolves around the technical challenges and strategic advantages of bringing
  1inch''s sophisticated DEX aggregation technology to Solana''s high-throughput environment,
  particularly in competition with established players like Jupiter.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**, specifically **DEX Aggregation**
  and **Liquidity Routing**. Key areas include the technical differences between EVM
  and Solana architectures, **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) mitigation strategies**,
  and the philosophical debate between open-source and closed-source protocols in
  the Solana ecosystem.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Intempest Swap Protocol (Solana Launch):** 1inch launched a unique "aggregator
  of aggregators" on Solana called the Intempest Swap Protocol. This system uses a
  **Dutch Auction** mechanism to sell user orders to market makers/arbitrageurs, allowing
  for on-chain order announcements (costing under $1) which is noted as being more
  decentralized than their previous EVM off-chain signing approach.

  *   **MEV Protection by Design:** The new protocol is designed to be inherently
  protected from MEV extraction (like sandwich attacks) by design, unlike many native
  Solana DEXs that rely on external RPC endpoints (like Jito) and associated bribes.

  *   **Liquid Protocol Re-emergence:** Kunz detailed their older, MEV-protected **Liquid
  Protocol** (developed in 2020), which used Dutch auctions to immediately solve arbitrage
  opportunities, preventing liquidity providers (LPs) from being exploited by just-in-time
  liquidity attacks. They plan to deploy an adapted version on Solana.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Competition with Jupiter:** 1inch acknowledges Jupiter as the current leader
  in Solana aggregation but aims to compete by offering superior MEV protection and
  better price impact reduction for larger trades via their unique routing engine
  (which is patented).

  *   **Value Capture for LPs:** The MEV-protected protocols aim to redirect value
  currently captured by searchers and MEV services back to liquidity providers, creating
  a positive feedback loop (more LP earnings $\rightarrow$ more liquidity $\rightarrow$
  better rates $\rightarrow$ more volume).

  *   **Price Improvement for Large Swaps:** For large transactions, 1inch claims
  their architecture significantly reduces price impact, citing historical EVM examples
  where users received substantial savings (e.g., 1 on 35,000 more WETH).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **1inch (Sergej Kunz):** The primary subject, detailing their expansion and
  technical approach.

  *   **Jupiter:** Acknowledged as the dominant DEX aggregator on Solana, which 1inch
  is directly competing against.

  *   **SolFi/Ellipsis Labs:** Mentioned as an example of a proprietary, closed-source
  DEX on Solana that achieves high efficiency, contrasting with 1inch''s open-source
  ethos.

  *   **ZenRock/ZenBTC:** Featured as a sponsor segment discussing Bitcoin exposure
  and yield generation on Solana via a decentralized custody network.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  Kunz expressed significant **skepticism and caution regarding closed-source protocols**
  on Solana (like SolFi). He views protocols where developers control the logic without
  open-source verification as highly centralized, raising regulatory red flags similar
  to traditional customer service entities, and increasing the risk of hacks (citing
  the Bybit incident). He strongly advocates for **fully non-custodial and atomic
  execution**.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where sophisticated, MEV-resistant routing engines
  become the standard, even on high-speed chains like Solana. 1inch is positioning
  itself as the provider of the **infrastructure layer** that abstracts away complexity
  and security risks for the end-user, potentially even integrating with existing
  successful aggregators like Jupiter as "resolvers." The trend toward proprietary,
  non-open-source DEXes on Solana is highlighted as a significant area of tension
  with established DeFi principles.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **DeFi professionals, blockchain architects, liquidity
  providers, and crypto investors** focused on layer-one performance comparisons (EVM
  vs. Solana) and the evolving landscape of DEX aggregation and MEV solutions.'
