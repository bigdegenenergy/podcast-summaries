    change in the US regulatory environment, specifically mentioning the departure
    of Gary Gensler and the classification of ETH as a commodity.

    disintermediation by eliminating friction-based revenue streams in traditional
    finance.'

  text: These if-then statements that you can program in Ethereum really removes a

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why Phantom Is Launching Perps + Why Bit Digital
  Ditched BTC for ETH - Ep. 866


  This episode of Unchained features two main interviews: one with **Brandon Milman,
  CEO of Phantom Wallet**, discussing their new perpetuals launch, and another with
  **Sam Tbarr, CEO of Bit Digital**, detailing their strategic pivot from Bitcoin
  mining to an Ethereum treasury strategy. The episode also includes listener commentary
  on the evolving crypto landscape, particularly concerning centralized players like
  Coinbase and Robinhood.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus areas are **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Product Innovation**
  (specifically perpetual futures integration into a major wallet) and **Corporate
  Treasury Strategy Shifts** within the crypto industry, contrasting Bitcoin-centric
  models with Ethereum-centric ones.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Phantom''s Perp Integration:** Phantom is leveraging **HyperLiquid** as the
  decentralized backend for its perpetual swaps, acting as a user-friendly front-end
  interface. This allows Phantom to offer access to high-liquidity, decentralized
  perps without building the core matching engine themselves.

  *   **HyperLiquid''s Role:** HyperLiquid is highlighted as the first decentralized
  venue to achieve "centralized exchange scale" liquidity for perpetuals, making it
  a viable decentralized alternative to previous attempts.

  *   **Mobile-First UX:** Phantom is prioritizing an opinionated, native mobile user
  experience for accessing complex DeFi products like perps, contrasting with the
  "one app wallet per app" model favored by embedded wallets.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Perpetuals Dominance:** Perpetual swaps are noted as one of the most crypto-native
  innovations, dominating trading volume, making their integration into mainstream
  wallets a significant market opportunity.

  *   **Bit Digital''s Strategic Pivot:** Bit Digital sold significant BTC holdings
  to fund a strategic shift into an **Ethereum Treasury strategy**, betting that regulatory
  clarity and ecosystem growth make ETH a superior long-term treasury asset compared
  to the saturated Bitcoin mining space.

  *   **Wallet vs. Exchange Entry Point:** The thesis presented suggests that **wallets
  will become the primary consumer entry point** into crypto as the ecosystem fragments
  across multiple chains, commoditizing the on-ramp function of centralized exchanges.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Phantom (Brandon Milman):** Launching perpetual swaps via HyperLiquid, aiming
  to become the world''s biggest consumer finance platform within five years by harnessing
  open, permissionless networks.

  *   **Bit Digital (Sam Tbarr):** Executed a major strategic shift, selling $30M
  in BTC to acquire ETH, driven by favorable regulatory changes (post-Gensler SEC)
  and the belief that Ethereum is the future growth vector ("go where the puck is
  going").

  *   **HyperLiquid:** The chosen decentralized liquidity layer for Phantom’s perps,
  praised for its superior liquidity aggregation compared to prior DEX attempts.

  *   **Coinbase/Robinhood:** Mentioned as major players integrating perps and developing
  their own chains/wallets, signaling the convergence of traditional finance interfaces
  with on-chain activity.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Favorable Shift for Ethereum:** Sam Tbarr emphasized that the departure of
  Gary Gensler and the arrival of a more friendly SEC chairman, coupled with legislative
  clarity (like the Clarity Act and stablecoin rules), signals that Ethereum is finally
  being treated favorably, likely classified as a commodity.

  *   **US Access Uncertainty:** Phantom noted that the perp launch is compliant with
  current regulations, meaning it will **not be immediately available in the US**,
  though they remain hopeful for future access as the regulatory environment evolves.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where:

  1.  **Wallets evolve into comprehensive consumer finance platforms** (Phantom''s
  5-year vision), integrating traditional financial tools (like Venmo/Robinhood) powered
  by on-chain efficiency.

  2.  **Social discovery is hypercharged within crypto tools**, focusing on verifying
  and sharing on-chain activities (like token trades or governance votes) rather than
  competing with general social media.

  3.  **Corporate treasuries are diversifying away from pure BTC mining** towards
  staking and holding assets like ETH, anticipating better regulatory footing and
  ecosystem growth in the Ethereum space.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto Industry Professionals, DeFi Developers,
  Crypto Investors, and Corporate Strategy Executives** interested in wallet evolution,
  derivative product adoption, and corporate treasury management in the digital asset
  space.'
