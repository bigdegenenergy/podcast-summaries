    (risk/reward speculation) to in-game mechanics, making the Web3 experience feel
    native to the player.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The broader meta of crypto is kind of taking a risk and feeling some sort
    of payoff, right? But it's predicting if something's going to go upward or downward...
    So, that factors into the game, but at a very small level.

    providers: prioritizing consumer experience and developer support (traffic, PMF,
    revenue) over pure ideological dogma.'

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The thing that stood out to us about Abstract is they were very clear. Look,
    we're thinking about the consumer experience first and foremost. We want to build

    games like Gigabers, and we want to send you traffic, and we want to help you
    find product-market fit, and we want to help you make revenue.
  topic: Technology/Business
- impact_reason: Describes a dynamic, on-chain economic model where the perceived
    'APY' or value of an asset is constantly adjusted by game updates and market forces,
    mimicking real DeFi dynamics.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It goes up or down, it changes as we ship different updates, and it depends
    on supply and demand of the materials. So, it really lets those players, as holders
    of the ROMs, lean into that side of the game.
  topic: DeFi/Investment

    rare NFTs funds the deflationary mechanism (buy and burn) of the main collection,
    directly benefiting existing holders.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: All of them are one-of-one characters, and they come with a cool ability.
    And then, what do we do with the auction funds? They are used to buy and burn
    the floor of the collection. So, that's been happening already.
  topic: DeFi/Investment
- impact_reason: Illustrates effective utility bridging for cross-chain assets (Ethereum
    L1 NFTs providing utility on an Abstract L2/sidechain game), creating tangible,
    recurring value for NFT holders.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The way that we've bridged the gap right now is that some of the one-of-ones
    that have been auctioned do have a special ability in the game. So, there was
    a batch of seven that we auctioned, which we call them Masters of the Gigabers,
    and they act as a skin factory within the game, meaning the holders of those NFTs
    get a special skin every week.
  topic: Technology/Web3
- impact_reason: Showcases highly complex, community-driven financial engineering
    where the utility of a single high-value NFT directly redistributes wealth back
    into the ecosystem based on auction outcomes.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We auctioned a character named ROM Lee, obviously based on the ROMs, and his
    auction went for something like 11 or 12 ETH. But his ability is that he's going
    to use the funds from his auction to sweep. He's going to sweep the ROMs collection
    and send... I think it's like 60% go to the final bidder and 30% go to the third-highest
    bidder.
  topic: DeFi/Investment

    acts as a market manipulator and social engineer, mirroring real-world DeFi governance
    risks and complex game theory.

  text: Gigas Maximus, who's kind of like the architect of Gigabers, he's the creator.
    ... He may be trying to manipulate the market. He may be trying to corner supply
    of something. He may be trying to stoke some beef between two different factions
    to create a faction war between them. But he's a much more interesting villain
    than a classic two-dimensional bad guy. The idea with Gigas is that ultimately
    what he wants to try to do is control the game economy and get players doing his
    bidding. So, he's a lot more Machiavellian and a lot more cunning and sinister...
  topic: Web3/Strategy
- impact_reason: This is a profound statement on early conviction. Hiring people who
    believed in the vision before external validation (market price, VC funding) leads
    to superior loyalty and commitment.
  relevance_score: 10

  text: What I love about the team that we were able to hire before all of this is
    they independently built their own conviction in us right before the market confirmed
    that for them.
  topic: investment
- impact_reason: A powerful testament to early financial discipline and potentially
    leveraging DeFi/treasury management to generate yield, reducing reliance on external
    capital.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The funny thing is, we almost didn't raise because we're in this great position
    where we don't need the money. We received funds and haven't needed them since.
    They're generating yield for us, which is kind of cool and surreal.
  topic: DeFi

    to use a hybrid on-chain/off-chain model based on feature necessity, rather than
    ideological purity.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Gigabers is not fully on-chain; it's partially on-chain. So, we're deciding
    on a feature-by-feature basis what goes on-chain and what doesn't.

    RPG elements ('dungeons') with Web3 mechanics ('fractions,' 'NFTs') under a decentralized
    structure.

  text: We took dungeons, we took fractions, we took NFTs, and how a decentralized
    studio pulled this game off.
  topic: Web3 Vision/Technology
- impact_reason: A strong counter-narrative to traditional project management, arguing
    that agility and responsiveness outweigh the commitment of a public roadmap, especially
    in fast-moving sectors like crypto/gaming.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We have this take that I think public roadmaps are a bit of an encumbrance...
    having a roadmap as more of an encumbrance than anything else.
  topic: Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Clearly defines their initial target demographic, which is essential
    for early Web3 projects: users who bridge the gap between gaming and crypto literacy.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We're building primarily for what we'd say is a crypto-native gamer or an
    on-chain gamer. So, it's someone who likes playing games, but they've already
    been onboarded to crypto.
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: Provides a concrete example of integrating crypto-like risk mechanics
    (loss of capital/assets) into gameplay loops without overwhelming the user.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: One example is you're trying to craft something... there's a chance that some
    of the crafts could fail, and if they fail, you lose your items... we're introducing
    lots and lots of these micro-experiences of risk and reward.
  topic: DeFi/Technology
- impact_reason: 'A pragmatic stance on blockchain infrastructure selection: utility
    and business viability (finding PMF) trump abstract ideological purity, especially
    for early-stage projects.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We heard all kinds of other versions and variations and dogmatic approaches
    about decentralization and the rest, which is important, but at the end of the
    day, we're a bootstrap startup. If we don't find PMF, forget everything else.
  topic: Strategy/Technology
- impact_reason: Acknowledges that the target audience enjoys the financial/trading
    aspect as much as the gameplay, confirming that NFTs should facilitate complex
    economic meta-games.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So, they kind of open this interesting trading meta-game, or they plan to
    the economic meta-game around the game itself. We have to recognize that our player
    set is kind of crypto-native gamers. Trading is one of the games that they love
    most...
  topic: Investment/DeFi
- impact_reason: Directly references a well-known, successful DeFi/NFT mechanism (Nouns
    DAO auction model) being adopted for treasury building and deflationary mechanics
    in a gaming context.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you guys are familiar with the Nouns auction system, they kind of pioneered
    this daily auction where we have one piece auctioned per day, and it built up
    this massive treasury for Nouns. So, that's what we're doing with the final 150
    pieces of our NFT collection.
  topic: DeFi/Technology
- impact_reason: Provides quantifiable evidence of the deflationary mechanism's success,
    showing over 10% reduction in supply driven by the auction treasury.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The last ten auctions, I think they went for... So, we're like 120th altogether,
    and the total amount of NFTs that have been bought and burned through this auction
    flywheel is, I think, around 420 now. So, more than 10% of the collection has
    been burned, and we still have over 100 auctions to go.
  topic: DeFi/Technology
- impact_reason: Quantifies the immediate, high financial value derived from NFT utility
    within the game, showcasing a strong incentive structure for high-tier NFT ownership.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And those skins right now are being valued in the market at something like
    0.8 ETH, 0.9 ETH. So, it's just a little money printer for them.
  topic: Investment/Adoption
- impact_reason: Addresses the critical challenge of accessibility in Web3 gaming,
    striving to balance high-value collector mechanics with casual, low-barrier participation.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We want someone who doesn't have a lot of time or doesn't have a lot of money
    to still be able to come into this game and participate in a meaningful way and
    have fun at the same time.
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: 'Describes the ideal hiring philosophy for decentralized or agile
    Web3 teams: prioritizing intrinsic motivation and shared vision over micromanagement.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We've tried to bring in people to the team who get it, people who are self-motivated,
    who don't need handholding and monitoring or to be shown or told what good looks
    like. They already know, and where there's a strong alignment for the shared vision.
    So, it's like playing in a band where, if you're going to jam or do some improvisation,
    your bandmates kind of already know what you're thinking...
  topic: Business/Strategy
- impact_reason: This introduces the concept of 'atomic scaling'—a highly efficient,
    lean operational philosophy, which is a powerful strategic insight for any startup,
    especially in capital-intensive Web3 environments.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This may be the largest we ever get, right? We're doing this thing called
    atomic scaling, which is trying to create as much value as we can with as few
    people and as few resources as possible.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: A direct challenge to traditional scaling wisdom (Brooks's Law implications),
    emphasizing the value of small, focused teams for speed and quality, highly relevant
    for lean Web3 development.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I don't actually think that increasing the team size helps us move faster
    or build a better product. In fact, it may make it harder for us to do so.

    a core group, fostering deep loyalty before any major product launch or financial
    incentive existed.

    we did have a small community of... It was literally just 10 or 20 people who
    hung out in a Discord together for the best part of the year while, unbeknownst
    to them, we quietly built the game Gigabers.

    and product usage over transactional content creation, crucial for genuine Web3
    community building.

    actually playing the game.

- impact_reason: Reiterates the commitment to lean operations even after securing
    VC funding, prioritizing product development and community over rapid, wasteful
    scaling.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We don't suddenly want to scale the team up, double, triple the size of the
    team, start spending like crazy. And we're still going to do grassroots, very
    organic, trench-level work, building community, retaining players, shipping surprisingly
    cool updates, and keeping the team very lean.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: 'A core principle for Web3 gaming adoption: user experience and fairness
    trump the need for 100% decentralization or on-chain settlement for every feature.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Most gamers, they don't care how the design decision is under the hood. They
    want to have a fun experience, they want fair trading, they don't want exploits,
    they don't want to be completely diluted by bots.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: 'A specific, actionable anti-Sybil/anti-bot mechanism: implementing
    a sign-up fee to ensure participants have ''skin in the game'' and filter out
    low-effort actors.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Everyone has had to pay to join the game, which kind of raises the bar or
    the overall floor of the participation in the game economy.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Acknowledges the immediate and profound threat/opportunity of AI
    in gaming, forcing developers to design systems resilient to automated players.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: AI is a massive paradigm shift for many different industries; gaming is no
    exception to that. And we're probably already at a point that you cannot determine
    whether a player is a human or is it AI behind those actions in the game.
  topic: technology

    user experience (fun) remains intact even when the system is being heavily exploited

    interaction.
  relevance_score: 8

    like, 'Hey, you said this was coming next month.' Actually, we can just continuously
    surprise them with what's actually coming out.
  topic: Business/Strategy
- impact_reason: Directly contrasts their agile method with the restrictive nature
    of the 'waterfall' approach common in traditional development, highlighting the
    rigidity imposed by public roadmaps.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think you guys hit the nail on the head with the agile approach because
    most projects are waterfall, you know, so it's one off to the other, and when
    you put these expectations out, they hold you accountable. It doesn't matter even
    if the environment has changed, they'll still hold you accountable for that one
    milestone that you said.

    an edge. That utility, very briefly, is it gives players energy, it gives them
    rare resources.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Dive into Gigaverse — the on-chain RPG redefining
  Web3 gaming!


  This episode of Dads Gone Crypto features **Founder Diff**, the mastermind behind
  the on-chain RPG **Gigabers**, detailing its rapid growth, unique development philosophy,
  and innovative integration of Web3 mechanics.


  **1. Focus Area**: Web3 Gaming, On-Chain RPG Development, Decentralized Studio Operations,
  and NFT Utility within Gaming Ecosystems.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Agile, Roadmap-less Development**: Gigabers deliberately avoids public roadmaps
  to maintain extreme agility, allowing them to pivot quickly based on community feedback
  and fast-moving crypto/gaming trends, preventing "expectation debt."

  *   **Risk/Reward Micro-Experiences**: The game integrates crypto-native concepts
  of risk and reward into core gameplay loops, such as crafting mechanics where ingredients
  can be lost upon failure, mirroring speculative behavior in broader crypto markets.

  *   **Abstract Chain Selection**: Abstract was chosen specifically for its consumer-first
  approach, focusing on building an app store experience that actively supports developers
  in finding Product-Market Fit (PMF) and generating revenue, which was crucial for
  the bootstrap startup.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Impressive Traction**: Gigabers achieved rapid success, attracting 75,000
  players, generating $4.5 million in game revenue, and facilitating over $9 million
  (potentially $11 million) in peer-to-peer asset trades within six months of launch.

  *   **NFT Utility & Deflationary Mechanics**: The premier asset, **ROMs**, provides
  an economic edge (energy, rare resources) that allows holders to lean into the trading
  meta-game, calculating an implied APY based on market prices.

  *   **GLHFers Auction Flywheel**: A secondary NFT collection, **GLHFers**, uses
  a Nouns-style deflationary auction model for its final 150 pieces, with auction
  proceeds used to buy and burn the collection''s floor price, demonstrating a mechanism
  for sustained asset value management.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Gigabers**: The on-chain RPG built on Abstract and powered by Proof of Play.

  *   **Founder Diff & Carnish**: The co-founders who built the game organically before
  quitting their day jobs to focus on it full-time.

  *   **Abstract**: The chosen blockchain partner, lauded for its focus on consumer
  experience and developer support.

  *   **GLHFers**: The initial PFP collection that introduced the deflationary auction
  mechanics and features characters (like "Masters of the Gigabers") whose utility
  bleeds into the main game.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   No direct regulatory discussion occurred, but the emphasis on **peer-to-peer
  trading ($9M+ volume)** highlights the organic, decentralized economic activity
  occurring within the game ecosystem, which often operates outside traditional gaming
  monetization structures.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  *   The success of Gigabers suggests a future where high-quality, engaging gameplay
  (leveraging nostalgia) can successfully coexist with on-chain mechanics, provided
  the onboarding friction is minimized (e.g., adding Stripe payments alongside crypto
  entry).

  *   The introduction of complex social layers like **Factions** and the Machiavellian
  architect **Gigas Maximus** hints at evolving game narratives driven by social meta-games
  designed to manipulate the in-game economy.


  **7. Target Audience**:

  *   Web3 game developers and founders seeking case studies on rapid scaling and
  decentralized development.

  *   Crypto investors and analysts interested in successful on-chain gaming models
  and NFT utility integration.

  *   Gamers curious about the intersection of deep gameplay aesthetics and blockchain
  economics.

  ### Comprehensive Narrative Summary


  The episode centers on the explosive growth and unique development philosophy of
  **Gigabers**, an on-chain RPG that rapidly attracted 75,000 players and generated
  significant revenue and trading volume. Founders Diff and Carnish detailed their
  journey from a weekend passion project to a full-time venture, emphasizing their
  **organic, surprise-driven launch** and subsequent commitment to an **agile, roadmap-less
  development cycle**. This approach is seen as crucial for staying relevant in the
  fast-moving crypto space, prioritizing player excitement over rigid milestone adherence.


  A core theme was **accessibility balanced with depth**. Gigabers is designed to
  be intuitive enough for casual players ("Uncle Jebediah") while offering deep economic
  engagement for crypto natives. This is achieved through strong nostalgic aesthetics
  (80s/90s gameplay feel) and the integration of **micro-experiences of risk and reward**
  within crafting and item acquisition.


  Technically, the choice of the **Abstract** chain was strategic, prioritizing a
  partner focused on consumer experience and developer success over pure dogma. The
  economic structure is multifaceted:

  1.  **ROMs**: Utility NFTs that grant an economic edge, fostering a trading meta-game
  where holders track implied APYs.

  2.  **GLHFers Auctions**: A deflationary mechanism where auction proceeds fund the
  buy-and-burn of the collection''s floor, creating sustained engagement and value
  capture for the ecosystem. The auction winners often gain in-game utility (e.g.,
  weekly skins), linking L1 activity directly to the game world.


  The discussion concluded by exploring the social meta-layer: seven **Factions**
  driven by unique lore and weekly competitions, overseen by the enigmatic **Gigas
  Maximus**. Gigas Maximus is positioned not as a simple villain, but as a Machiavellian
  economic manipulator intended to orchestrate social conflict and control the game''s
  economy, suggesting the future of Gigabers involves complex, player-driven economic
  narratives layered on top'
