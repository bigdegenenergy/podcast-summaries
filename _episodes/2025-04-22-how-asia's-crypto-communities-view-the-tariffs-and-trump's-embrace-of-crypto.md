    adopt looser definitions for utility tokens, potentially simplifying token launches
    compared to strict pre-approval regimes.

  This 81-minute episode of *Unchained* features host Laura Shin interviewing **Emily
  Parker** (China and Japan advisor at the Global Blockchain Business Council) and
  **Yet** (CIO/Chairman of Annamoka Brands) to discuss the geopolitical and regulatory
  climate surrounding crypto in Asia, particularly in light of potential US tariffs
  and the shift in US political stance toward digital assets.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**: The primary focus is on the **geopolitical and regulatory dynamics
  of the cryptocurrency and Web3 industry in key Asian jurisdictions (China, Hong
  Kong, Japan, Korea)**, specifically analyzing the impact of US trade tariffs and
  the perceived crypto-friendliness of the potential Trump administration.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **China''s Crypto Stance Nuance**: The common narrative that crypto is outright
  banned in China is inaccurate; while trading is prohibited, owning Bitcoin is not
  a crime, and trading continues actively.

  *   **Blockchain as Strategic Infrastructure**: China views blockchain and Web3
  as strategically important, evidenced by state media (CCTV) coverage, though this
  is distinct from supporting decentralized crypto trading.

  *   **Regulatory Arbitrage Shift**: Jurisdictions like Hong Kong and Singapore benefited
  from US hostility toward crypto, but this dynamic is shifting as the US now competes
  to become the "crypto capital."


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Crypto as Risk-On Asset**: Generally, in the current uncertain macro environment
  (including tariff threats), crypto (especially altcoins) is being treated as a risk-on
  asset, leading to de-risking.

  *   **Bitcoin as Macro Hedge**: There is a growing conversation in Hong Kong and
  Japan about adding Bitcoin to corporate balance sheets specifically as a hedge against
  potential dollar weakening or geopolitical instability caused by tariffs.

  *   **Diversification Strategy**: Many large Chinese businesses dependent on US
  trade have already diversified their supply chains over the last several years in
  anticipation of trade friction, mitigating the immediate shock of potential tariffs.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Emily Parker & Yet**: Provided expert analysis based on their deep involvement
  in Asian markets, policy advisory (Yet advises Neom/Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong''s
  Web3 Council), and investment (Annamoka Brands has over 540 Web3 portfolios).

  *   **D-Sprad (Korea)**: Mentioned as a research organization that observed a surge
  in Korean crypto market sentiment correlating directly with Trump’s election victory
  in late 2024.

  *   **Vases/Jesse Pollock**: Briefly mentioned via listener comments regarding the
  failure of a creator coin to gain traction due to poor timing and market conditions.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   **Japan''s Tax Hurdle**: A major obstacle to crypto adoption in Japan is the
  high crypto tax rate (up to 55%), though there is serious discussion about lowering
  it closer to the 20% rate for stocks, potentially paving the way for a Bitcoin ETF.

  *   **Hong Kong as China''s Proxy**: Hong Kong’s pro-crypto regulatory moves (stablecoin
  rules, exchange licenses) are seen as happening with Beijing’s explicit approval,
  positioning Hong Kong as the conduit for exporting Chinese financial innovation
  (like "Dim Sum bonds") globally, which geopolitically challenges US dominance.

  *   **US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve**: While the US established a strategic Bitcoin
  reserve, there was no immediate corresponding chatter or policy push in Hong Kong
  or Singapore for similar government reserves.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  *   The shifting US stance is influencing regulatory momentum in Asia; Japan may
  move toward ETF approval sooner than previously expected.

  *   Increased competition between the US and Asian hubs (Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai)
  will provide entrepreneurs with more choice regarding regulatory environments.

  *   The interplay between US tariffs, dollar strength, and Bitcoin''s role as a
  potential hedge will remain a central theme in Asian investment circles.


  **7. Target Audience**: **Crypto/Web3 Professionals, Geopolitical Analysts, Institutional
  Investors, and Policy Makers** focused on the intersection of global trade, US politics,
  and Asian digital asset regulation.

  **Comprehensive Summary:**


  The podcast episode provided a deep dive into how recent US political shifts—specifically
  the threat of tariffs and Donald Trump’s embrace of crypto—are being interpreted
  across Asia''s leading digital asset hubs. Emily Parker and Yet emphasized that
  generalizations are difficult, but distinct regional reactions emerged.


  Regarding the tariffs, the general sentiment in places like China and Hong Kong
  was not panic, but rather preparedness, with many businesses having already diversified
  away from heavy US reliance. The crypto conversation mirrored global trends: questioning
  if Bitcoin serves as a hedge against a weakening dollar. However, Yet noted a tangible
  trend in Hong Kong and Japan of companies beginning to add Bitcoin to their balance
  sheets as a macro hedge.


  The most significant discussion centered on the **US policy reversal**. Asian jurisdictions,
  which previously benefited from US hostility via regulatory arbitrage, are now recalibrating
  as the US actively seeks to become the "crypto capital." This shift appears to be
  influencing local policy: in Japan, the changing winds in the US are correlated
  with serious internal discussions about drastically lowering crypto taxes (from
  55% to near 20%) to enable a future Bitcoin ETF. Similarly, in Korea, market sentiment
  saw a noticeable surge immediately following Trump’s election win, attributed to
  the expectation of a more crypto-friendly era.


  Yet stressed the geopolitical importance of Hong Kong as China’s proxy for blockchain
  innovation. While China officially bans crypto trading, its strategic endorsement
  of blockchain technology is channeled through Hong Kong’s evolving regulatory framework
  (stablecoins, exchange licensing). This positioning'
