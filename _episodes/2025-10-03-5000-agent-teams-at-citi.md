summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - Citigroup is rolling out an agentic AI system capable of executing multi-step
    tasks across different internal systems autonomously, starting with 5,000 employees.
  - The primary benefit of Citi's new agents is the removal of human touchpoints between
    sequential workflow steps, increasing autonomy.
  - Citigroup is finding it difficult to accurately estimate the cost and ROI of agentic
    systems due to the rapidly decreasing cost of model usage.
  - The impact of increased capacity from agents on the workforce remains an open
    question, with the potential for reinvestment in growth versus cost-cutting.
  - Distill AI, which focuses on operationalizing AI within large enterprises, raised
    $175 million in a Series B, achieving a $1.8 billion valuation.
  - Perplexity launched a premium email assistant plug-in for Gmail and Outlook, positioning
    email as the central 'home of context' for professional memory and productivity.
  - OpenAI is actively hiring for an applied Evals team to build systems that directly
    shape model behavior and accelerate reliability for economically valuable tasks.
  overview: Citigroup is launching a major initiative to deploy agentic AI capabilities
    across its platform, starting with a pilot for 5,000 employees, marking a significant
    shift toward autonomous task completion that connects previously siloed workflows.
    This move highlights the growing enterprise focus on operationalizing AI for efficiency,
    even as companies grapple with accurately calculating the ROI and long-term workforce
    impact of these advanced systems. The transcript also covers related industry
    developments, including Distill AI's massive funding round, Perplexity's new email
    assistant, and OpenAI's focus on building robust evaluation systems.
