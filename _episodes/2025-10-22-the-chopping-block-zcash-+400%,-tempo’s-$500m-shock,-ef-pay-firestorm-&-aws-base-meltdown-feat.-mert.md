  topic: strategy/technology

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: The Chopping Block: Zcash +400%, Tempo’s $500M
  Shock, EF Pay Firestorm & AWS/Base Meltdown feat. Mert - Ep. 929


  This 60-minute episode of *The Chopping Block* features hosts Seed, Tom, and special
  guest Mert (Helius) dissecting several major controversies and market movements
  in the crypto space, focusing heavily on the Zcash price surge and the internal
  turmoil within the Ethereum ecosystem sparked by the Tempo fundraising and subsequent
  talent departures.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics, Ecosystem Politics,
  and Talent Retention**. Key areas include the recent price action of Zcash (ZEC),
  the massive funding round for the L1 blockchain Tempo, and the internal governance
  and compensation issues within the Ethereum Foundation (EF).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Zcash Privacy Mechanics:** The Zcash price surge highlighted a widespread
  lack of understanding among newer crypto participants regarding fundamental privacy
  features like shielded transactions and anonymity sets, underscoring the industry''s
  general knowledge gap on privacy tech.

  *   **Tempo''s Architecture (Implied):** While not deeply technical, the discussion
  touches on the debate over whether payment-focused chains (like Tempo, which is
  incubated by Stripe) can succeed as Layer 1s, with Mert suggesting they might be
  better suited as Layer 2 solutions.

  *   **ZK Proofs in Bitcoin:** The conversation references Satoshi Nakamoto’s early
  acknowledgment of the desire for ZK proofs in Bitcoin, contrasting it with Zcash’s
  successful implementation, which is a key technical differentiator.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Zcash Narrative Shift:** The 400% ZEC price rally is seen as a shift in narrative,
  moving from long-term stagnation to being viewed as the "best trade in crypto,"
  driven by renewed interest in privacy and influencer momentum (Mert, Naval).

  *   **Tempo Valuation:** The $500M Tempo raise at a $5B valuation is considered
  strong given the backing (Stripe, Paradigm), though one host suggested its immediate
  trading valuation could be closer to $15B based on current market comparables, implying
  it might be slightly overpriced at launch.

  *   **Investment Philosophy Conflict:** The Zcash debate highlights a clash between
  the "cypherpunk ethos" (privacy, sovereignty) often associated with early Bitcoin,
  and the current TradFi-aligned narrative of Bitcoin (ETFs, BlackRock).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Zcash (ZEC):** The subject of a massive recent price pump, leading to friction
  with OG Bitcoin maximalists.

  *   **Tempo:** The blockchain incubated by Stripe and Paradigm, which raised $500M
  at a $5B valuation, drawing criticism for potentially "sucking value" from the Ethereum
  ecosystem.

  *   **Ethereum Foundation (EF):** Central to the controversy regarding underpayment
  and political centralization.

  *   **Dankrad:** Key Ethereum Foundation researcher who announced his move to Tempo
  full-time, causing significant backlash in the ETH community.

  *   **Peter Szilagyi:** Former head of Geth development, who leaked a memo detailing
  severe underpayment ($600k over six years) and political centralization within the
  EF leadership structure.

  *   **Mert (Helius):** Defended the Zcash movement and strongly criticized the EF''s
  compensation structure, calling it a "colossal failure of leadership."


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion indirectly touches on regulatory risk, noting that developers working
  on privacy code like Zcash''s face potential legal jeopardy ("you can go to jail
  for writing privacy code"), which Mert argues makes Zcash a low-EV (negative expected
  value) project for bad actors looking to orchestrate simple pumps.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a fracturing within the crypto community regarding core
  values:

  1.  **Talent Exodus:** The EF''s failure to compensate top talent adequately (as
  evidenced by Szilagyi’s memo) will continue to drive key developers toward well-funded,
  corporate-backed L1s like Tempo, potentially leading to an "Ethereum talent drain."

  2.  **Ecosystem Competition:** The Zcash rally signals that privacy narratives still
  hold significant sway, challenging the current focus of Bitcoin influencers on TradFi
  integration.

  3.  **Culture vs. Compensation:** The industry is moving toward a reality where
  developers must choose between the "nonprofit land" ethos of organizations like
  the EF and the lucrative opportunities offered by for-profit chains.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Investors, Ecosystem Builders, Blockchain
  Developers, and Venture Capitalists** who need an insider perspective on ecosystem
  politics, talent dynamics, and significant market movements outside of the immediate
  Bitcoin/Ethereum narratives.'
