  extracted: mention some of the conjectures we've been talking about you know a lot
    of stuff is built on top of them now there's a lot of effects Pico's MP has more
    ripple effects than basically any other right if the readman hypothesis is disprove
    it um that would be a big mental shock to the number theorist but it would have
    follow on effects for cryptography um because a lot of cryptography uses number
    theory uses number theory constructions evolving perhaps and so forth and it relies
    very much on the intuition that number theorists have built over many many years
    of what operations evolving primers behave randomly and what ones don't and in
    particular encryption methods are designed to turn text with information on it
    into text which is indistinguishable from from random noise so um and hence we
    believe to be almost impossible to crack at least mathematically um but uh if
    something has caught our police at the readman hypothesis is wrong it means that
    they're there are actual patches of the primes that we not aware of and if there's
    one there's probably going more um and suddenly a lot of our crypto systems are
    in doubt yeah but then how do you then say stuff about the primes yeah that you're
    going towards the coaxing conjecture again um because if i you do you want it
    to be random right yes yes yeah yeah so more broadly i'm just looking for more
    tools more ways to show that yeah that things are right now how do you prove it
    conspiracy doesn't happen right is there any chance to that p equals np is there
    some can you imagine a possibly universe it is possible i mean this is various
    uh scenarios i mean if there's there's one where it is technically possible but
    in practice never actually implementable the evidence is sort of slightly pushing
    in favor of no that we probably p is not equit np i mean it seems like it's one
    of those cases similar similar to rumen hypothesis it i think the evidence is
    leaning pretty heavily on the no certainly more on the no than on the yes the
    funny thing about p equals np so we have also a lot more obstructions than we
    do for almost any other problem um so while there's evidence we also have a lot
    of results ruling out many many types of approaches to the problem uh this is
    the one thing that the computer scientist is actually very good at it's actually
    saying that certain approaches cannot work no go theorems it could be understandable
    we don't yeah we don't know there's a funny story i read that when you won the
    fields metal somebody from the internet wrote you and asked uh you know what are
    you gonna do now they want this procedure award and then you just quickly very
    humbly said that you know this shiny metal is not gonna solve any of the problems
    i'll currently working out some okay keep working on them it's just first of all
    it's funny to me that you would answer an email in that context and second of
    all it um it just shows your humility but anyway uh maybe you could speak to the
    fields metal but it's another way for me to ask about uh uh about uh Gregorio
    Proman what do you think about him famously declining the fields metal and millennial
    prize which came with a one million dollar of prize money he stated that i'm not
    interested in money or fame the prize is completely irrelevant for me if the proof
    is correct then no other recognition is needed yeah well he's he's somewhat of
    an outlier um even among mathematicians who tend to uh do have uh some more idealistic
    views i've never met him i think i'd be interested in me the one day but i never
    had the chance i know people who met him he's always had strong views about certain
    things um you know i mean it's not like he was completely isolated from the math
    community i mean he would give talks and write papers and so forth um but i somewhere
    he just decided not to engage with the rest of the community he was dissolution
    or something i don't know um and he decided to uh to uh to piece out uh and you
    know collect mushrooms in same period as work or something and then that's that's
    fine you know and you can you can do that um i mean that's another sort of flip
    side i mean we are not a lot of problems that we solve you know they some of them
    do have practical application that's that's great but uh like if you stop thinking
    about a problem you know so he's he hasn't published since in this field but that's
    fine there's many many other people who've done this as well um yeah so i guess
    one thing i didn't realize initially with the field's metal is that it sort of
    makes you part of the establishment um you know so you know most mathematicians
    you know there's uh uh you just career mathematicians you know you just focus
    on publishing your next paper maybe getting one just promoted one one rank you
    know and and starting a few projects maybe having to take some students or something
    yeah but then suddenly people want your opinion on things and uh you have to think
    a little bit about uh you know things that you might just have foolishly say because
    you know no one's going to listen to you uh so it's more important now is it constraining
    to you are you able to still have fun and be a rebel and try crazy stuff and well
    uh play with the idea i have a lot less free time than i had previously um i mean
    mostly by choice i mean i i i i i i can always see i have the option to sort of
    uh decline so i declare a lot of things i could decline even more um well i could
    acquire a repetition thing so unreliable that you would always been asked anymore
    um this is this i love the different algorithms here this is great this is it's
    always an option um but you know um there are things that i like i mean so i mean
    i i i don't spend as much time as i do as a postdoc you know just just working
    in one part of the time or um falling around i still do that a little bit but
    yeah as you're advancing your career it's some of the more soft skills so math
    somehow front nodes all the technical skills to the early stages of your career
    so um yeah so it's uh as a postdoc is publisher of perish you're you're you're
    incentivized to basically focus on on proving very technical themes to prove yourself
    um as far as proof the theorems um but then as as you get more senior you have
    to start you know mentoring and and and and giving interviews and uh and trying
    to shape um direction of field both research wise and and you know uh sometimes
    you have to uh you know just to present with mr

    it would have follow on effects for cryptography um because a lot of cryptography
    uses number theory uses number theory constructions evolving perhaps and so forth
    and it relies very much on the intuition that number theorists have built over
    many many years of what operations evolving primers behave randomly and what ones
    don't and in particular encryption methods are designed to turn text with information
    on it into text which is indistinguishable from from random noise so um and hence
    we believe to be almost impossible to crack at least mathematically um but uh
    if something has caught our police at the readman hypothesis is wrong it means
    that they're there are actual patches of the primes that we not aware of and if
    there's one there's probably going more um and suddenly a lot of our crypto systems
    are in doubt yeah but then how do you then say stuff about the primes yeah that
    you're going towards the coaxing conjecture again um because if i you do you want
    it to be random right yes yes yeah yeah so more broadly i'm just looking for more
    tools more ways to show that yeah that things are right now how do you prove it
    conspiracy doesn't happen right is there any chance to that p equals np is there
    some can you imagine a possibly universe it is possible i mean this is various
    uh scenarios i mean if there's there's one where it is technically possible but
    in practice never actually implementable the evidence is sort of slightly pushing
    in favor of no that we probably p is not equit np i mean it seems like it's one
    of those cases similar similar to rumen hypothesis it i think the evidence is
    leaning pretty heavily on the no certainly more on the no than on the yes the
    funny thing about p equals np so we have also a lot more obstructions than we
    do for almost any other problem um so while there's evidence we also have a lot
    of results ruling out many many types of approaches to the problem uh this is
    the one thing that the computer scientist is actually very good at it's actually
    saying that certain approaches cannot work no go theorems it could be understandable
    we don't yeah we don't know there's a funny story i read that when you won the
    fields metal somebody from the internet wrote you and asked uh you know what are
    you gonna do now they want this procedure award and then you just quickly very
    humbly said that you know this shiny metal is not gonna solve any of the problems
    i'll currently working out some okay keep working on them it's just first of all
    it's funny to me that you would answer an email in that context and second of
    all it um it just shows your humility but anyway uh maybe you could speak to the
    fields metal but it's another way for me to ask about uh uh about uh Gregorio
    Proman what do you think about him famously declining the fields metal and millennial
    prize which came with a one million dollar of prize money he stated that i'm not
    interested in money or fame the prize is completely irrelevant for me if the proof
    is correct then no other recognition is needed yeah well he's he's somewhat of
    an outlier um even among mathematicians who tend to uh do have uh some more idealistic
    views i've never met him i think i'd be interested in me the one day but i never
    had the chance i know people who met him he's always had strong views about certain
    things um you know i mean it's not like he was completely isolated from the math
    community i mean he would give talks and write papers and so forth um but i somewhere
    he just decided not to engage with the rest of the community he was dissolution
    or something i don't know um and he decided to uh to uh to piece out uh and you
    know collect mushrooms in same period as work or something and then that's that's
    fine you know and you can you can do that um i mean that's another sort of flip
    side i mean we are not a lot of problems that we solve you know they some of them
    do have practical application that's that's great but uh like if you stop thinking
    about a problem you know so he's he hasn't published since in this field but that's
    fine there's many many other people who've done this as well um yeah so i guess
    one thing i didn't realize initially with the field's metal is that it sort of
    makes you part of the establishment um you know so you know most mathematicians
    you know there's uh uh you just career mathematicians you know you just focus
    on publishing your next paper maybe getting one just promoted one one rank you
    know and and starting a few projects maybe having to take some students or something
    yeah but then suddenly people want your opinion on things and uh you have to think
    a little bit about uh you know things that you might just have foolishly say because
    you know no one's going to listen to you uh so it's more important now is it constraining
    to you are you able to still have fun and be a rebel and try crazy stuff and well
    uh play with the idea i have a lot less free time than i had previously um i mean
    mostly by choice i mean i i i i i i can always see i have the option to sort of
    uh decline so i declare a lot of things i could decline even more um well i could
    acquire a repetition thing so unreliable that you would always been asked anymore
    um this is this i love the different algorithms here this is great this is it's
    always an option um but you know um there are things that i like i mean so i mean
    i i i don't spend as much time as i do as a postdoc you know just just working
    in one part of the time or um falling around i still do that a little bit but
    yeah as you're advancing your career it's some of the more soft skills so math
    somehow front nodes all the technical skills to the early stages of your career
    so um yeah so it's uh as a postdoc is publisher of perish you're you're you're
    incentivized to basically focus on on proving very technical themes to prove yourself
    um as far as proof the theorems um but then as as you get more senior you have
    to start you know mentoring and and and and giving interviews and uh and trying
    to shape um direction of field both research wise and and you know uh sometimes
    you have to uh you know just to present with mr.
  type: recommendation
- actionable: true
  confidence: medium
  extracted: say for people don't know not only are you known for the brilliance of
    your work but the incredible productivity just the number of papers which are
    all very high quality so there's something to be said about being able to jump
    from topic to topic yeah it works for me yeah i mean i mean i'm being there also
    people who are very productive and they take focus very deeply on yeah i think
    i want us to find their own workflow um like one thing which is a shame in mathematics
    is that we have mathematics there's sort of a one-size-fits-all approach to teaching
    mathematics um and you know so we have a certain curriculum and so forth i mean
    you know maybe like if you do math competitions or something you get a slightly
    different experience but um i think many people they don't find their their native
    math language until very late or usually too late so they they stop doing mathematics
    and they have a bad experience with a teacher who's trying to teach them one way
    to do mathematics that they don't like it um my theory is that um humans don't
    come evolution has not given us a math center of a brain directly we have a vision
    center and a language center and some other centers um which have evolution as
    home but we it doesn't we don't have any sense of mathematics um but our other
    centers are sophisticated enough that different people uh we we we can repurpose
    other areas of our brain to do mathematics so some people have figured out how
    to use the visual center to do mathematics and so they think very visually when
    they do mathematics some people have to repurpose their their language center
    and they think very symbolically um you know um some people like if they are very
    competitive and they they're like gaming they there's a type there's a part of
    your brain that's very good at at at solving puzzles and games and and and that
    can be repurposed but like when i talked about my�hetician you know they don't
    quite think they i can tell that they're using some of different styles of thinking
    then i i mean not not destroyed but they they may prefer visual like i i don't
    like you prefer visual so much i need lots of visual aids myself um you know my
    thanks for vice the common language so we can still talk to each other even if
    we are thinking in different ways but you can tell there's a different set of
    subsystems being used in the thinking process like they take it from past they're
    very quick at things that i struggle with and vice versa um and yet they still
    get to the same goal um that's beautiful and yeah but i mean the way we educate
    unless you have like a personal life to you there was something i mean education
    sort of just financial scale has to be mass produced you know you have to teach
    the 30 kids you know they have 30 different styles you can't you can't teach 30
    different ways on that topic what advice would you give to students uh young students
    who are struggling with math and but are interested in it and would like to get
    better is there something in this yeah um in this complicated educational context
    what would you yeah it's a tricky problem one nice thing is that there are now
    lots of sources for my faculty in Richmond outside the classroom so in my day
    they're already there are math competitions um and you know they're also like
    popular math books in the library um yeah but now you have you know youtube uh
    there are forums just devoted to solving you know math puzzles and um and math
    shows up in another place you know like um for example there are hobbyists who
    play poker for fun and um they they you know they are for very specific reasons
    i'm interested in very specific probability questions um yes and and they they
    actually know there's a community of amateur proletists in in poker um in chess
    and baseball i mean there's there's there's uh yeah um there's math all over the
    place um and i'm hoping actually with there with these new sort of tools for lean
    and so forth that actually we can incorporate the broader public into math research
    projects um like this is almost is doesn't happen at all currently so in the sciences
    there's some scope for citizen science like astronomers uh they're the images
    we discover comets and there's biologists there people who could identify butterflies
    and so forth um and in math in um there are small number of activities where amateur
    mathematicians can like discover new primes and so forth but but previously because
    we have to verify every single contribution um like most mathematical research
    projects it would not help to have input from the general public in fact it would
    just be be time-consuming because just error-checking and everything um but you
    know one thing about these formalization projects is that they are bringing together
    more bringing in more people so i'm sure that high school students have already
    contributed to some of these formalizing projects who contributed to math will
    have um you know you don't need to be a PhD holder to just work on one atomic
    thing there's something about the formalization here that also uh as a very first
    step opens it up to the programming community to yes the people who are already
    comfortable yes the program it seems like programming is somehow maybe just the
    feeling but it feels more accessible to folks than math math is seen as this like
    extreme especially modern mathematics seen as this extremely difficult to enter
    area and programming is not so that could be just an entry point you can execute
    and it can get results you know you can put out the world pretty quickly yeah
    um yeah like if uh if programming was taught as an almost entirely theoretical
    subject where you just talk with the computer science that's the theory of functions
    and and and and and routines and so forth and outside of some some very specialized
    homework assignments you don't like your program like on the weekend for fun yeah
    or yeah there would be as consider as hard as math um yeah so as I said you know
    there are communities of non-matheticians where they're deploying math for some
    very specific purpose you're like like optimizing the poker game and and for them
    then math becomes fun for them uh what advice would you give in general to young
    people how to pick a career how to find themselves like yeah that's a tough tough
    tough question yeah so um there's a lot of certainty now in the world you know
    I mean I there was this period after the war where uh at least in the west you
    know if you came from a good demographic you uh you know like you there was a
    very stable path through it to a good creator it goes to college you get an education
    you pick one profession and you stick to it just becoming much more think of the
    past so I think you just have to be adaptable and flexible I think people will
    have to get skills that are transferable you know like learning one specific program
    in language or one specific subject mathematics or something it's it's that is
    still this not a super transferable skill but sort of knowing how to um reason
    with abstract concepts or how to problem solve and things go wrong and so anyway
    these are things which I think will still need even as our tools get better and
    you know you you would be working with AI sports so forth but actually you're
    an interesting case study I mean you're like one of the great living mathematicians
    right and then you had a way of doing things and then all of a sudden you start
    learning I mean first of all you kept learning new fields yeah but you've learned
    lean that's that's a non trivial thing to learn like that's a yeah that's a for
    a lot of people this is extremely uncomfortable leap to take right yeah a lot
    of mathematicians um let's well I've always been interested in new ways to do
    mathematics I I feel like a lot of the ways we do things right now are inefficient
    um like I spend like many my colleagues you spend a lot of time doing very routine
    computations or doing things that other mathematicians would instantly know how
    to do and we don't know how to do and why can't we search and get a quick response
    and so on so that's why I've always been interested in exploring new workflows
    about four or five years ago I was on a committee where we had to ask for ideas
    for interesting workshops to run at a math institute and at the time Peter Schorzer
    had just formalized one of his his new theorems and there's some other developments
    in computer assisted proof that look quite interesting and I said oh we should
    we should uh um we should have a workshop on this this is a good idea um and then
    I was a bit too enthusiastic about this idea so I got violent told to actually
    write it so I did with a bunch of other people colonization Jordan Ellen Bergen
    and and uh a bunch of other people um and it was it wasn't a nice success we put
    together a bunch of mathematicians and computer scientists and other people and
    and we got up to spin and state we are um and it was really interesting um developments
    that but most mathematicians didn't know what was going on that lots of nice proofs
    of concept you know it's just so hints of what was going to happen this was just
    before chat GBT but there was even then there was one talk about language models
    and the potential uh capability of those in the future so that got me excited
    about the subject so I started giving talks um about this is some of which more
    of us just start looking at um now that I went to run this conference and then
    chat GBT came out and like suddenly AI was everywhere and so I got interviewed
    a lot um about about this topic um and in particular the interaction between AI
    and former proof assistants and I said yeah they should be combined this this
    this is this is um this is a perfect synergy to happen here and at some point
    I realized that I have to actually do not just talk the talk but walk the walk
    you know like you know I don't work in machine learning and I don't work in true
    formization and there's a limit to how much I can just rely on authority and saying
    you know I'm a I'm a wonder mathematician just trust me you know when I say that
    this is going to change my fate because I'm not doing it any when I don't do any
    of myself so I thought I had to actually uh uh justify it yeah but there's a lot
    of what I get into actually um I don't quite see an advice as how much time I'm
    going to spend on it and it's only after I'm sort of waist deep in in in a project
    that I I realized by that point I'm well that's deeply admirable that you're willing
    to go into the fray be in some small way beginner right or have some of the sort
    of challenges that a beginner would right and yeah new concepts new ways of thinking
    also you know sucking at a thing that others I think I think in that talk you
    know you could be a field metal winning mathematician and undergrad know something
    better yeah um I think mathematics inherently I mean mathematics is so hugely
    say certain nobody knows all of modern mathematics um and inevitably we make mistakes
    and um you know uh you can't cover up your mistakes with just sort of provider
    and I mean because people will ask for your proofs and if you don't have the proofs
    you know what the proofs um I don't love math yeah so it does keep us honest I
    mean not I mean you can still it's not a perfect panacea but I think uh we do
    have more of a culture of admitting error than because we're forced to all the
    time big ridiculous question I'm sorry for it once again who is the greatest mathematician
    of all time maybe one who's no longer with us uh who are the candidates? the oiler,
    gauze, newton, ramanogen, helper so first of all I says I asked much before like
    there's some time dependence but on the day yeah like if you if you if you park
    cumulatively over time for example you click like like sort of like this is one
    of the the pretenders um and then maybe some unnamed anonymous method just before
    that um you know whoever came up with the concept of numbers you know um do mathematicians
    today still feel the impact of Hilbert just oh yeah directly of what everything
    has happened in the 20th century yeah Hilbert spaces we have lots of things that
    are named after him of course just the arrangement of mathematics and just the
    introduction of certain concepts I mean 23 problems have been extremely influential
    there's some strange power to the declaring which problems yeah hard to solve
    the statement of the open problems yeah I mean you know this is bystander effect
    in everywhere like if no one says you should do x and I just sort of mills around
    waiting for somebody else to to do something and like nothing gets done um so
    and and like it's the one one thing that actually you have to teach undergraduate
    mathematics is that you always try something so um you see a lot of paralysis
    in an undergraduate trying a math problem if they recognize that there's a certain
    technique that can be applied they will try it but there are problems for which
    they see none of their standard techniques obviously applies and the common reaction
    is then just paralysis I don't know what to do I was I think there's a quote from
    the Simpsons I've tried nothing and I'm all that of ideas um so you know like
    the next step then is to try anything like no matter how stupid and in fact how
    almost the stupid of the better um which you know I'm one a technique which is
    almost guaranteed to fail but the way it fails is going to be instructive um like
    it fails because you do not at all taking to account this hypothesis oh this hypothesis
    must be useful that's a clue I think he also suggested somewhere this this fascinating
    approach which really stuck with me as they're using it it really works I think
    you said it's called structure procrastination no yes it's when you really don't
    want to do a thing the imagine a thing you don't want to do more yes yes that's
    worse than that and then in that way you procrastinate by not doing the thing
    that's worse yeah yeah it's a nice it's a nice hack it actually works yeah yeah
    if there's um I mean with anything like you know I mean like you um psychology
    is really important by you you you you you talk to athletes like marathon runners
    and so forth and yeah and they talk about what's the most important thing is that
    they're training veteran men or the diet and so well so much of it is psychology
    um you know just tricking yourself to to think that the form is feasible um so
    you motivate to do it is there something our human mind will never be able to
    comprehend well I sort of I guess the mathematician I mean yeah okay it's a reduction
    I and it's between a lot there must be some it's between large number like I'm
    just that I was the first thing I came to mind so that but even broadly is there
    are we limb is there something about our mind that's we're going to be limited
    even with the help of mathematics well okay I mean it's like how much augmentation
    are you willing like like for example if I didn't even have pen and paper um I
    guess I had no technology whatsoever okay so I'm not allowed blackboard pen and
    paper you're already much more limited than you would be incredibly limited even
    language they have the English language is a technology it's a it's a it's one
    that's been very internalized so you're right they're really the the formulation
    of the problems and correct because there really is no longer a just a solo human
    we're already augmented an extremely complicated intricate ways right yeah yeah
    yeah so worry like a collective intelligence yes yes I guess so humanity plural
    has much more intelligence in principle on his good days then then the individual
    humans put together it can all have less okay but um yeah so yeah math math math
    the mathematical community plural is incredibly super intelligent uh entity um
    that uh no single human mathematician can can can come close to to to replicating
    you see it a little bit on these like question analysis sites um uh so this mathematical
    flow which is the math version of stackable flow and like sometimes you get like
    this very quick responses to very difficult questions from the community um and
    it is it's a pleasure to watch actually well as as as as an expert I'm a fan spectator
    of that of that site just seeing the brilliance of the different people they um
    the depth analysis that people have and though the willingness to engage in the
    in the rigor and the nuance of the particular questions pretty cool to watch it's
    fun it's honestly just fun to watch um what gives you hope about this whole thing
    we have going on human civilization I think uh yeah the um the younger generation
    is always like like really creative and enthusiastic and inventive um it's a pleasure
    working with with uh with uh with young students um you know the uh the progress
    of science tells us that the problems that used to be really difficult can become
    extremely you know can become like trivial to solve you know I mean like it was
    like navigation you know just just knowing where you work on the planet was this
    horrendous problem people people died um you know I lost fortunes because so they
    couldn't navigate you know and we have devices in our pockets that do this automatically
    for us like is a completely solved problem you know so things that I've seen unfeedable
    for us now could be maybe just so homework exercises with you yeah one of the
    things I find really sad about the finiteness of life is that I won't get to see
    all the cool things would create as a civilization you know that because it in
    the next hundred years two hundred years just imagine showing showing up in two
    hundred years yeah well already plenty has happened you know like if you could
    go back in time and talk to you if your teenage self was on thing you know I mean
    yeah yeah and just the internet and and now AI I mean it's like I get the they've
    been in they've been in internalized and says yeah of course uh and I can understand
    a voice and and give reason why you know slightly incorrect answers to any question
    but yeah this was mind blowing even two years ago and in the moment it's hilarious
    to watch on the internet and so on the the drama uh people take everything for
    granted very quickly and then they we humans seem to entertain ourselves with
    drama well out of anything that's created somebody needs to take one opinion another
    person needs to take an opposite opinion argue with each other about it but when
    you look at the arc of things I mean it's just even in progress of robotics yeah
    just to take a step back and be like wow this is beautiful the way humans are
    able to create this yeah when they infrastructure and the culture is healthy yeah
    the community of humans can be so much more intelligent and mature and rational
    than individuals within it well one place I can always count on rationality is
    the comment section of your blog which I'm a fan of there's a lot of really smart
    people there and thank you of course for putting those ideas out on the blog and
    it's I can't tell you how uh on or d'I m that you would spend your time with me
    today I was looking forward this for a long time there I'm a huge fan you inspire
    me you inspire millions of people thank you so much for talking thank you it was
    a pleasure thanks for listening to this conversation with Terence Tao to support

    just be be time-consuming because just error-checking and everything um but you
    know one thing about these formalization projects is that they are bringing together
    more bringing in more people so i'm sure that high school students have already
    contributed to some of these formalizing projects who contributed to math will
    have um you know you don't need to be a PhD holder to just work on one atomic
    thing there's something about the formalization here that also uh as a very first
    step opens it up to the programming community to yes the people who are already
    comfortable yes the program it seems like programming is somehow maybe just the
    feeling but it feels more accessible to folks than math math is seen as this like
    extreme especially modern mathematics seen as this extremely difficult to enter
    area and programming is not so that could be just an entry point you can execute
    and it can get results you know you can put out the world pretty quickly yeah
    um yeah like if uh if programming was taught as an almost entirely theoretical
    subject where you just talk with the computer science that's the theory of functions
    and and and and and routines and so forth and outside of some some very specialized
    homework assignments you don't like your program like on the weekend for fun yeah
    or yeah there would be as consider as hard as math um yeah so as I said you know
    there are communities of non-matheticians where they're deploying math for some
    very specific purpose you're like like optimizing the poker game and and for them
    then math becomes fun for them uh what advice would you give in general to young
    people how to pick a career how to find themselves like yeah that's a tough tough
    tough question yeah so um there's a lot of certainty now in the world you know
    I mean I there was this period after the war where uh at least in the west you
    know if you came from a good demographic you uh you know like you there was a
    very stable path through it to a good creator it goes to college you get an education
    you pick one profession and you stick to it just becoming much more think of the
    past so I think you just have to be adaptable and flexible I think people will
    have to get skills that are transferable you know like learning one specific program
    in language or one specific subject mathematics or something it's it's that is
    still this not a super transferable skill but sort of knowing how to um reason
    with abstract concepts or how to problem solve and things go wrong and so anyway
    these are things which I think will still need even as our tools get better and
    you know you you would be working with AI sports so forth but actually you're
    an interesting case study I mean you're like one of the great living mathematicians
    right and then you had a way of doing things and then all of a sudden you start
    learning I mean first of all you kept learning new fields yeah but you've learned
    lean that's that's a non trivial thing to learn like that's a yeah that's a for
    a lot of people this is extremely uncomfortable leap to take right yeah a lot
    of mathematicians um let's well I've always been interested in new ways to do
    mathematics I I feel like a lot of the ways we do things right now are inefficient
    um like I spend like many my colleagues you spend a lot of time doing very routine
    computations or doing things that other mathematicians would instantly know how
    to do and we don't know how to do and why can't we search and get a quick response
    and so on so that's why I've always been interested in exploring new workflows
    about four or five years ago I was on a committee where we had to ask for ideas
    for interesting workshops to run at a math institute and at the time Peter Schorzer
    had just formalized one of his his new theorems and there's some other developments
    in computer assisted proof that look quite interesting and I said oh we should
    we should uh um we should have a workshop on this this is a good idea um and then
    I was a bit too enthusiastic about this idea so I got violent told to actually
    write it so I did with a bunch of other people colonization Jordan Ellen Bergen
    and and uh a bunch of other people um and it was it wasn't a nice success we put
    together a bunch of mathematicians and computer scientists and other people and
    and we got up to spin and state we are um and it was really interesting um developments
    that but most mathematicians didn't know what was going on that lots of nice proofs
    of concept you know it's just so hints of what was going to happen this was just
    before chat GBT but there was even then there was one talk about language models
    and the potential uh capability of those in the future so that got me excited
    about the subject so I started giving talks um about this is some of which more
    of us just start looking at um now that I went to run this conference and then
    chat GBT came out and like suddenly AI was everywhere and so I got interviewed
    a lot um about about this topic um and in particular the interaction between AI
    and former proof assistants and I said yeah they should be combined this this
    this is this is um this is a perfect synergy to happen here and at some point
    I realized that I have to actually do not just talk the talk but walk the walk
    you know like you know I don't work in machine learning and I don't work in true
    formization and there's a limit to how much I can just rely on authority and saying
    you know I'm a I'm a wonder mathematician just trust me you know when I say that
    this is going to change my fate because I'm not doing it any when I don't do any
    of myself so I thought I had to actually uh uh justify it yeah but there's a lot
    of what I get into actually um I don't quite see an advice as how much time I'm
    going to spend on it and it's only after I'm sort of waist deep in in in a project
    that I I realized by that point I'm well that's deeply admirable that you're willing
    to go into the fray be in some small way beginner right or have some of the sort
    of challenges that a beginner would right and yeah new concepts new ways of thinking
    also you know sucking at a thing that others I think I think in that talk you
    know you could be a field metal winning mathematician and undergrad know something
    better yeah um I think mathematics inherently I mean mathematics is so hugely
    say certain nobody knows all of modern mathematics um and inevitably we make mistakes
    and um you know uh you can't cover up your mistakes with just sort of provider
    and I mean because people will ask for your proofs and if you don't have the proofs
    you know what the proofs um I don't love math yeah so it does keep us honest I
    mean not I mean you can still it's not a perfect panacea but I think uh we do
    have more of a culture of admitting error than because we're forced to all the
    time big ridiculous question I'm sorry for it once again who is the greatest mathematician
    of all time maybe one who's no longer with us uh who are the candidates? the oiler,
    gauze, newton, ramanogen, helper so first of all I says I asked much before like
    there's some time dependence but on the day yeah like if you if you if you park
    cumulatively over time for example you click like like sort of like this is one
    of the the pretenders um and then maybe some unnamed anonymous method just before
    that um you know whoever came up with the concept of numbers you know um do mathematicians
    today still feel the impact of Hilbert just oh yeah directly of what everything
    has happened in the 20th century yeah Hilbert spaces we have lots of things that
    are named after him of course just the arrangement of mathematics and just the
    introduction of certain concepts I mean 23 problems have been extremely influential
    there's some strange power to the declaring which problems yeah hard to solve
    the statement of the open problems yeah I mean you know this is bystander effect
    in everywhere like if no one says you should do x and I just sort of mills around
    waiting for somebody else to to do something and like nothing gets done um so
    and and like it's the one one thing that actually you have to teach undergraduate
    mathematics is that you always try something so um you see a lot of paralysis
    in an undergraduate trying a math problem if they recognize that there's a certain
    technique that can be applied they will try it but there are problems for which
    they see none of their standard techniques obviously applies and the common reaction
    is then just paralysis I don't know what to do I was I think there's a quote from
    the Simpsons I've tried nothing and I'm all that of ideas um so you know like
    the next step then is to try anything like no matter how stupid and in fact how
    almost the stupid of the better um which you know I'm one a technique which is
    almost guaranteed to fail but the way it fails is going to be instructive um like
    it fails because you do not at all taking to account this hypothesis oh this hypothesis
    must be useful that's a clue I think he also suggested somewhere this this fascinating
    approach which really stuck with me as they're using it it really works I think
    you said it's called structure procrastination no yes it's when you really don't
    want to do a thing the imagine a thing you don't want to do more yes yes that's
    worse than that and then in that way you procrastinate by not doing the thing
    that's worse yeah yeah it's a nice it's a nice hack it actually works yeah yeah
    if there's um I mean with anything like you know I mean like you um psychology
    is really important by you you you you you talk to athletes like marathon runners
    and so forth and yeah and they talk about what's the most important thing is that
    they're training veteran men or the diet and so well so much of it is psychology
    um you know just tricking yourself to to think that the form is feasible um so
    you motivate to do it is there something our human mind will never be able to
    comprehend well I sort of I guess the mathematician I mean yeah okay it's a reduction
    I and it's between a lot there must be some it's between large number like I'm
    just that I was the first thing I came to mind so that but even broadly is there
    are we limb is there something about our mind that's we're going to be limited
    even with the help of mathematics well okay I mean it's like how much augmentation
    are you willing like like for example if I didn't even have pen and paper um I
    guess I had no technology whatsoever okay so I'm not allowed blackboard pen and
    paper you're already much more limited than you would be incredibly limited even
    language they have the English language is a technology it's a it's a it's one
    that's been very internalized so you're right they're really the the formulation
    of the problems and correct because there really is no longer a just a solo human
    we're already augmented an extremely complicated intricate ways right yeah yeah
    yeah so worry like a collective intelligence yes yes I guess so humanity plural
    has much more intelligence in principle on his good days then then the individual
    humans put together it can all have less okay but um yeah so yeah math math math
    the mathematical community plural is incredibly super intelligent uh entity um
    that uh no single human mathematician can can can come close to to to replicating
    you see it a little bit on these like question analysis sites um uh so this mathematical
    flow which is the math version of stackable flow and like sometimes you get like
    this very quick responses to very difficult questions from the community um and
    it is it's a pleasure to watch actually well as as as as an expert I'm a fan spectator
    of that of that site just seeing the brilliance of the different people they um
    the depth analysis that people have and though the willingness to engage in the
    in the rigor and the nuance of the particular questions pretty cool to watch it's
    fun it's honestly just fun to watch um what gives you hope about this whole thing
    we have going on human civilization I think uh yeah the um the younger generation
    is always like like really creative and enthusiastic and inventive um it's a pleasure
    working with with uh with uh with young students um you know the uh the progress
    of science tells us that the problems that used to be really difficult can become
    extremely you know can become like trivial to solve you know I mean like it was
    like navigation you know just just knowing where you work on the planet was this
    horrendous problem people people died um you know I lost fortunes because so they
    couldn't navigate you know and we have devices in our pockets that do this automatically
    for us like is a completely solved problem you know so things that I've seen unfeedable
    for us now could be maybe just so homework exercises with you yeah one of the
    things I find really sad about the finiteness of life is that I won't get to see
    all the cool things would create as a civilization you know that because it in
    the next hundred years two hundred years just imagine showing showing up in two
    hundred years yeah well already plenty has happened you know like if you could
    go back in time and talk to you if your teenage self was on thing you know I mean
    yeah yeah and just the internet and and now AI I mean it's like I get the they've
    been in they've been in internalized and says yeah of course uh and I can understand
    a voice and and give reason why you know slightly incorrect answers to any question
    but yeah this was mind blowing even two years ago and in the moment it's hilarious
    to watch on the internet and so on the the drama uh people take everything for
    granted very quickly and then they we humans seem to entertain ourselves with
    drama well out of anything that's created somebody needs to take one opinion another
    person needs to take an opposite opinion argue with each other about it but when
    you look at the arc of things I mean it's just even in progress of robotics yeah
    just to take a step back and be like wow this is beautiful the way humans are
    able to create this yeah when they infrastructure and the culture is healthy yeah
    the community of humans can be so much more intelligent and mature and rational
    than individuals within it well one place I can always count on rationality is

    the existence and smoothness of solutions, specifically whether infinite velocity
    (singularity/blow-up) can occur from smooth initial conditions.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There's a famous, I saw a problem called the Navier Stokes regularity problem.
    So the Navier Stokes equations, equations that govern a fluid flow or incompressible
    fluid is like water. The question asks, if you start with a smooth velocity field
    of water, can it ever concentrate so much that the velocity can be infinite at
    some point? That's called a singularity.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: 'Identifies the core mathematical conflict in Navier-Stokes: the
    linear, stabilizing dissipation term versus the nonlinear, destabilizing transport
    term. This concept of competing forces is highly relevant to analyzing complex,
    nonlinear systems like deep learning dynamics.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So the key phenomenon that my technique exploits is what's called supercriticality.
    So in partial differential equations, often these equations are like a tug of
    war between different forces. So in Navier Stokes, there's the dissipation force
    coming from viscosity... But there's also transport that energy from in one location
    of space can get transported because of fluid in motion to other locations. And
    that's a nonlinear effect, and that causes all the problems.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: Crucially distinguishes between critical (2D) and supercritical (3D)
    regimes in PDEs, explaining why the 3D Navier-Stokes problem is vastly harder—a
    direct parallel to complexity scaling in other physical/computational models.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Navier Stokes is what's called supercritical. So at smaller and smaller scales,
    the transport terms are much stronger than the viscosity terms. So the viscosity
    terms are things that calm things down. And so this is why the problem is hard.
    In two dimensions... the Navier Stokes equations is what's called critical, the
    effect of transport and the effect of viscosity, apart the same strength, even
    at very, very small scales. And we have a lot of technology to handle critical
    and also subcritical equations and proof of regularity. But for supercritical
    equations, it was not clear what was going on.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: 'This clearly defines the core mathematical challenge in Navier-Stokes:
    the balance between viscosity (dissipation/regularity) and non-linear advection
    (transport/potential blowup). This is fundamental to understanding turbulence
    and the Millennium Prize problem.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So there are these two competing terms in the Navier Stokes equation, the
    dissipation term and the transport term. If the dissipation term dominates, if
    it's large, then basically you get regularity. And if the transport term dominates,
    then then we don't know what's going on.
  topic: technical
- impact_reason: Identifies the 3D Navier-Stokes problem as 'supercritical,' meaning
    non-linear effects overwhelm stabilizing effects (viscosity) at small scales,
    directly explaining why predicting fine-scale fluid behavior is so difficult.

  text: So I realized is that if you could pull the same thing off for the actual
    equations. So if the equations of water support a computation, so like you can
    imagine kind of a steam punk, but it's really water punk type of thing where,
    you know, so modern computers are electronic... But instead of electrons, you
    can imagine these pulses of water moving in a certain velocity.

    Proman who proved the Poincare conjecture and did so by working alone for seven
    years with basically little contact with the outside world.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: #472 – Terence Tao: Hardest Problems in Mathematics,
  Physics & the Future of AI


  This 203-minute episode features a deep conversation with **Terence Tao**, one of
  the world''s most preeminent mathematicians, covering his work on foundational mathematical
  problems, their surprising connections to physics, and broader reflections on technology
  and the future of AI.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion primarily focused on **Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Physics**,
  specifically:

  *   **Hard Mathematical Problems:** Deep dives into the Kakeya Conjecture (and its
  connection to the 3D needle rotation problem) and the Navier-Stokes Existence and
  Smoothness (Millennium Prize) problem.

  *   **Fluid Dynamics and PDEs:** Exploring concepts like wave propagation, singularities
  (blow-ups), and the balance between dissipation (viscosity) and nonlinear transport
  terms in fluid equations.

  *   **Philosophy of Mathematics & Technology:** Reflections on the nature of mathematical
  discovery, the role of technology (like AI and search engines) in offloading memory,
  and the pursuit of absolute certainty versus practical approximation.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Kakeya Conjecture in 3D:** The problem concerns the minimum volume required
  to rotate a thin object (like a telescope or needle) through every possible direction
  in 3D space. Tao discussed how the solution connects to wave propagation, where
  a negative result (efficient packing of directional "tubes") could imply the formation
  of singularities (blow-ups) in certain wave equations.

  *   **Navier-Stokes Obstruction:** Tao detailed his work on an *averaged* 3D Navier-Stokes
  equation where he successfully engineered a finite-time blow-up. This serves as
  a mathematical **obstruction**, proving that any successful proof of global regularity
  (smoothness) for the true Navier-Stokes equations *must* utilize a specific feature
  of the original equation that his simplified, blow-up-prone version lacks.

  *   **Supercriticality in PDEs:** The difficulty in solving problems like Navier-Stokes
  stems from a "tug of war" between the linear, calming effect of **dissipation (viscosity)**
  and the non-linear, chaotic effect of **transport**. Navier-Stokes is "supercritical"
  because at smaller scales, the transport term dominates the dissipation term, making
  the system unpredictable.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **AI and Cognitive Offloading:** The discussion touched on how tools like Notion
  AI are offloading rote memorization, potentially freeing human cognition for deeper
  reasoning—a shift that could redefine high-value intellectual work.

  *   **Automation of Financial Oversight:** While discussing the complexity of running
  a business, the host speculated on the future role of an "AI CFO," concluding that
  while routine tasks will be automated (leveraging tools like NetSuite), human wisdom
  will remain crucial for navigating complex edge cases.

  *   **Building the Future Trajectory:** The host emphasized that rather than fearing
  technological shifts (like widespread robotics), the focus should be on actively
  building and steering the trajectory toward human flourishing (relevant to companies
  like Shopify).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Terence Tao:** The central figure, renowned for his breadth and depth across
  mathematics, and his work on the Kakeya and Navier-Stokes problems.

  *   **Sujika Kakeya:** Japanese mathematician whose 1918 puzzle inspired the Kakeya
  Conjecture.

  *   **Notion, Shopify, NetSuite, Element, AG1:** Sponsors whose products were used
  as springboards for discussions on collaboration tools, e-commerce infrastructure,
  business management, and physical performance/health.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where:

  1.  **Mathematical Certainty Remains Paramount:** Despite the rise of powerful approximations
  (like those used in engineering), the pursuit of 100% mathematical proof for foundational
  problems (like Navier-Stokes) will continue to drive fundamental scientific understanding.

  2.  **Cognitive Specialization:** Technology will increasingly handle factual recall,
  pushing human expertise toward abstract reasoning, pattern recognition, and the
  synthesis of disparate fields.

  3.  **Physics and Math Convergence:** Progress in complex PDEs (like fluid dynamics)
  will continue to rely on abstract mathematical tools that rule out physical impossibilities,
  providing crucial insights into stability and singularity formation in nature.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Advanced Researchers, Applied Mathematicians,
  Theoretical Physicists, AI/ML Engineers** interested in the theoretical underpinnings
  of complex systems, and **Technology Strategists** interested in the impact of cognitive
  offloading tools on high-level intellectual work.'
