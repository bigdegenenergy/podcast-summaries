    follow trends.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And then the other big thing is I feel that philosophy made me really think
    about established institutions, why they're established, and if they make sense
    for everyone. And crypto allows you to ask the same questions because there are
    a lot of projects that are really shitty, and you wonder why they get money, and
    then there are projects that really could change the world and they're questioning
    the status quo.
  topic: Web3 Vision
- impact_reason: 'Identifies key real-world use cases for blockchain: financial inclusion
    in emerging markets and modernizing stagnant legacy systems like supply chain.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Well, I think things that I like to, we like to do emerging market stuff,
    things that are going to allow for certain groups of people in emerging markets
    to have better ways to make payments, to be participatory in the global economy,
    ways to increase, I mean, even things like supply chain, how do we increase things
    that have been very stagnant for a long time, very, you know, legacy systems,
    how do we use blockchain to make that innovative?
  topic: Adoption/Technology
- impact_reason: Clearly states the Web3 counter-narrative against Big Tech centralization,
    specifically calling out cloud storage as a key area for decentralization.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What else? Things like decentralized cloud storage. So right now we're living
    in a world, at least in the US, especially, but I think we would say the world
    where the big tech guys rule everything. Amazon, you know, we have basically the
    five big stocks on the stock exchange. And so any sort of blockchain tool that
    could come in to change that and decentralize that monopoly is of interest to
    us as well.
  topic: Web3 Vision
- impact_reason: Uses Ethereum's success as evidence that collaboration, rather than
    maximalism, drives ecosystem scale and innovation.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Ethereum has grown immensely over any other ecosystem. But yeah, it's the
    only way. We're incubating a couple products right now with partners, and the
    only way for scale is collaboration.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: A stark, impactful comparison emphasizing the immaturity of the crypto
    market cap relative to major Web2 giants (like Apple), underscoring the urgency
    for industry unity.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The entire crypto ecosystem is smaller than one Web2 product. So if we don't
    collaborate, we won't move anywhere.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: A direct, relatable anecdote illustrating the high-yield promise
    and catastrophic risk associated with centralized lending platforms (CeFi) before
    their collapse.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I was a Celsius customer. So, you know. Oh, there you go. Okay. So at the
    time, I love making 13% until the one bankrupted, you know.
  topic: DeFi
- impact_reason: Defines the critical role of credible, often TradFi-adjacent, thought
    leaders in bridging the gap for mass adoption by establishing trust.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Thought leaders are super important because they give credibility to the space.
    So someone that's coming probably from like a TradFi background that's gone into
    crypto in the last five, 10 years and can explain and give credibility to this
    not being a grifter's space...
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: 'Defines the highest tier of thought leader: those who risk their
    established, doxed personal credibility without direct financial incentive from
    the promotion.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Those are a lot of other people, and those, those for me are like true followers.
    You need to be those, the guys you need to be listening to. They're the ones that
    take their personal credibility, they're not making any money per se from that
    interaction.
  topic: business

    organic journalism, contrasting it with the rise of pay-to-play content.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We need more journalists, and we need more credible news sources in the crypto
    industry. There aren't many. And some have gone to a lot of to like pay-to-play.

- impact_reason: 'Defines the core value proposition of micro-KOLs: high trust, genuine
    curation, and essential grassroots support for new projects.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think what's great about micro-influencers is that they've done a really
    good job of curating their communities, and people really trust them because they're
    doing what they love, and they're doing due diligence on projects, and they're
    kind of keeping the crypto projects afloat.
  topic: Adoption/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Provides a direct, actionable investment thesis for marketing budgets:
    shift spending from expensive macro-influencers to cost-effective, high-trust
    micro-KOLs.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: my suggestion from an agency and from a project perspective is to definitely
    invest more in micro-KOLs than in these big ones that are a hundred thousand followers
    or more and they're charging a grand or five to 20 grand for a post because I
    think it's going to be the micro-influencers that are going to push projects forward
    for sure.
  topic: Investment/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Provides a strong rationale for why philosophy majors thrive in
    crypto: the inherent need to critically question established systems and logic,
    which is fundamental to decentralized technology.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think it's the ability to question a lot. So it's kind of like, does this
    work, does this not work? Why? The logic behind things. That's a word. So just
    questioning, understanding if this makes sense, why it makes sense. It should
    be to go with the grain, should be to question the normal route and try and figure
    out where around it.
  topic: Strategy/Philosophy

    to rich, verifiable on-chain data to fuel growth strategies, moving beyond traditional
    marketing guesswork.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We are a data-driven, we're the number one data-driven marketing growth marketing
    agency for Web3. What that means is that there are tons of agencies out there
    that do marketing, but our whole philosophy and mission is that everything should
    be fueled by data. So we live in, we're working in a space where we can get so
    much data because we're working with on-chain analytics.
  topic: Business/Technology
- impact_reason: Highlights the massive education and adoption gap that still exists
    globally, making 'reach' (awareness and understanding) the primary hurdle for
    Web3 growth.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So reach, I think, is massively important because of the fact that so few
    people in the world even understand what we do, what's happening in crypto.
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: Addresses the critical challenge of integrating rapidly evolving
    blockchain technology into formal, slow-moving academic curricula.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Education is huge. So my co-founder is actually a professor at a university,
    and she's working on a lot of initiatives on how you can't have like a blockchain
    degree because by the time you've studied it in four years, it's obsolete, right?
    I mean, it moves so fast.
  topic: Adoption/Education

    education, even when taught by newly converted academics.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: He said that he was tapped to do the class on blockchain because he was the
    youngest professor on staff. They were like, learn about it and teach it. And
    his is the only class that has a waiting list for the last 10 years of people
    that want to take it, and he always fills it of like 100 people.
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: Argues that collaboration is essential for survival and progress,
    especially during market downturns, to overcome product similarity and build stronger
    ecosystems.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: More than anything, crypto needs to be a collaborative space because especially
    when we see kind of a bear market, a lot of these products are very similar in
    nature. So the more collaborative we are, I think the more we can get ahead.
  topic: Strategy
- impact_reason: A powerful statement on communication strategy, arguing against maximalist
    echo chambers in favor of open dialogue.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: People don't want to listen to someone in an echo chamber. They want to hear
    a conversation more than a monologue.
  topic: Strategy/Adoption
- impact_reason: Highlights the core tension in the crypto community between maximalism
    (focusing on one chain/asset) and the necessity of collaboration for ecosystem
    growth.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The solution to me is the opposite of, is the opposite of collaboration. So
    how do you get to collaboration from maximalization?
  topic: strategy

    in novel, cross-layer infrastructure solutions, distinguishing it from the maturity/boring
    nature of stablecoins.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Stablecoin is kind of boring because they're like banks, right? I think the
    energy, what I feel is really around different forms, like different cool infrastructure
    products. So how are we creating new layers, things that aren't Layer 1 and not
    a Layer 2, but something that's going across every layer of blockchain.
  topic: technology

    associated with specific custodians/wallets, highlighting the dangers of hacks
    and loss of funds.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I used Eidoo. I had a lot of certain coins in there, and Eidoo was hacked
    and taken over by North Korean hackers, I think. And then I tried to get the money
    out, and then money was taken out for me by them.
  topic: technology
- impact_reason: Shifts the narrative focus for mainstream acceptance from purely
    political demands ('less regulation') to tangible economic benefits ('diversify
    economic systems').
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: '...talking about it more than just, we need less regulation, but more about
    how can we diversify the current economic systems so that we''re seeing better
    returns for everyone and we have secured futures.'
  topic: regulation
- impact_reason: Clearly distinguishes between genuine thought leaders and anonymous,
    paid promoters (KOLs/shillers) who damage market integrity.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What they are, are anonymous accounts on X that are shilling coins. They in
    no way shape or form are a thought leader.

    paid shilling by anonymous accounts.

    outlets may be compromising journalistic integrity due to internal pressures for
    speed over accuracy.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: CoinDesk used to be a place where you could really trust, but I have heard
    from some other journalists that there is like pressure on the inside to just
    get stories out.

    L1/L2 narrative, focusing on interoperable, foundational infrastructure.

  text: I think the energy, what I feel is really around different forms, like different
    cool infrastructure products. So how are we creating new layers, things that aren't

    they'll post your article. And so there are very few at this point that are completely

- impact_reason: Draws an analogy to traditional VIP/alpha groups to explain why highly
    targeted, niche communities (even small ones) possess disproportionate value.

  text: it's like having a VIP or an alpha community. So when you have, when you have
    a community that's a thousand people, but it's just a thousand people, but they're
    not curated for a specific reason, they're not going to be as valuable to you.

    tightly curated community, emphasizing shared passion over sheer size.

    going to buy it because you know that they're there.
  topic: Strategy/Adoption
- impact_reason: Illustrates a common entry point into the crypto space—learning rapidly
    under a knowledgeable mentor, often driven by necessity (bad job market) and rewarded
    with equity, highlighting the steep learning curve and opportunity in early-stage
    blockchain projects.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I was on a specific project that was around blockchain, but was talking about
    Corridor, which was a permissioned, a private blockchain. And took the job on
    because it was a bad job market and was basically paid in equity. But the founder

    me under his wing. I learned a crap load in six months. It was like my second
    masters and never looked back.

    that, we do have a mission, I think, to take on projects that are going to do
    something rather different in this space. So we don't generally try to take on

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why the Crypto Industry Needs Authentic Thought
  Leadership Now More Than Ever Before, with Catie Romero-Finger @ BABs


  This 34-minute episode of the Crypto Hipster podcast features host Jimmy Elfassan
  interviewing Catie Romero-Finger, founder of Babs Labs, focusing on the critical
  need for data-driven marketing, authentic thought leadership, and genuine utility
  in the evolving Web3 space.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**: The discussion centers on **Web3/Crypto Marketing and Growth
  Strategy**, emphasizing the shift from hype to data-driven results, the importance
  of authentic communication (thought leadership) over shilling, and identifying projects
  focused on real-world utility (e.g., emerging markets, supply chain, decentralized
  infrastructure).


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Data-Driven Growth**: Babs Labs operates as a data-driven marketing agency,
  leveraging extensive on-chain analytics available in Web3 to create more effective
  growth campaigns, moving beyond traditional marketing guesswork.

  *   **Infrastructure Focus**: Current energy and innovation in the space are shifting
  toward novel infrastructure products that operate across different blockchain layers
  (not just L1s or L2s), as well as decentralized solutions challenging Big Tech monopolies
  (e.g., decentralized cloud storage).

  *   **Education Obsolescence**: The rapid pace of blockchain technology means traditional
  four-year degrees are often obsolete upon graduation, necessitating continuous,
  applicable education through certifications and focused university chapters.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Collaboration Over Maximalism**: The speaker strongly advocates for collaboration
  across ecosystems (e.g., Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum) because the total crypto market
  cap is still smaller than that of a single major Web2 company (like Apple), making
  collective growth essential.

  *   **Utility Focus**: Babs Labs prioritizes projects with tangible use cases, such
  as improving payment rails in emerging markets or innovating stagnant legacy systems
  like supply chains.

  *   **Wallet Security Risks**: The conversation highlighted the danger of relying
  on certain wallets, referencing personal negative experiences (hacks, losses), underscoring
  that security and trust remain paramount for user adoption.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Catie Romero-Finger (Babs Labs)**: Founder of the data-driven marketing agency
  for Web3.

  *   **Philosophy Majors**: Noted as having a high representation in crypto, attributed
  to skills like questioning the status quo and deep logical reasoning.

  *   **Or (Client)**: A decentralized AI product whose professor-founder at Columbia
  teaches the only consistently waitlisted blockchain class, demonstrating high latent
  demand for quality education.

  *   **Anna Mocha Brands/Open Campus**: Mentioned in the context of developing educational
  initiatives.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   The discussion touched upon the need for thought leaders to shift the narrative
  away from simply demanding "less regulation" toward explaining *how* blockchain
  can diversify and secure future economic systems, making the technology palatable
  to mainstream financial audiences (like those on Bloomberg).


  **6. Future Implications**:

  *   The industry must mature past siloed "maximalism" and embrace collaboration
  to achieve meaningful scale.

  *   The future of credible communication relies on **authentic thought leaders**
  who risk their personal credibility by speaking to mainstream media, rather than
  anonymous, paid "KOLs" (Key Opinion Leaders) who merely shill tokens.

  *   There is a significant gap in the market for credible, organic news sources
  that can provide due diligence on projects.


  **7. Target Audience**: Crypto founders, Web3 marketers, growth strategists, investors
  seeking quality projects, and professionals interested in the intersection of technology,
  philosophy, and business strategy.


  ---


  **Comprehensive Summary:**


  The episode explores the current state of Web3 growth, arguing that the industry
  urgently requires **authentic thought leadership** to move beyond speculative hype
  and achieve mass adoption. Catie Romero-Finger of Babs Labs frames her agency''s
  mission around leveraging **on-chain data** to drive marketing success, contrasting
  this with the prevalent "shilling" culture.


  Romero-Finger, whose background in philosophy informs her contrarian approach to
  questioning established institutions, believes this questioning mindset is vital
  for discerning valuable crypto projects from "shitty" ones. She highlights Babs
  Labs’ focus on projects delivering real-world utility, such as enhancing payment
  rails in emerging markets and decentralizing cloud storage to challenge Big Tech
  monopolies.


  A major theme was the distinction between genuine thought leaders and anonymous
  Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs). True thought leaders are doxed, risk their personal
  credibility by engaging with mainstream media (like Bloomberg), and provide nuanced
  explanations of crypto''s potential to secure economic futures. In contrast, many
  KOLs are merely paid promoters, a practice users are increasingly wary of due to
  past financial losses (e.g., Celsius customers).


  The conversation stressed that **collaboration is non-negotiable for scale**. Given
  that the entire crypto market cap is smaller than that of a single tech giant, ecosystem
  maximalism hinders progress. Furthermore, education is identified as a critical
  bottleneck; the industry needs practical, adaptable learning pathways (certifications,
  university chapters) to cultivate the talent required for growth. Finally, the event
  landscape is evolving toward more curated, focused gatherings where face-to-face
  networking remains highly effective for fostering the necessary partnerships.'
