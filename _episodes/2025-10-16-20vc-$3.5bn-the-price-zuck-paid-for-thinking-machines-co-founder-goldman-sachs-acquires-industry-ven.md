summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Valuations, Exits, and the Future of Venture


  This episode of the 20VC podcast, featuring Harry Stebbings alongside venture veterans
  Jason Lampkin and Rory O''Driscoll, dives deep into several high-profile recent
  events in the tech and finance world, focusing heavily on valuation dynamics, founder
  loyalty, and the evolving structure of asset management.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **General Tech and Venture Capital Strategy**, specifically
  covering M&A activity in the asset management space, high-stakes founder departures
  from major startups, and the strategic financial maneuvers of large tech investors
  like SoftBank.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **AI Agent Reliability:** A brief, humorous mention of the host relying heavily
  on AI agents working "all night," highlighting the growing integration and dependence
  on advanced automation in professional workflows.

  *   **Asset Purchase vs. Stock Purchase Analogy:** The departure of the Thinking
  Machines co-founder is likened to an "asset purchase" (acquihire) rather than a
  traditional M&A, where the buyer (Meta) is primarily interested in securing the
  talent/assets (the people) rather than the entire corporate structure, a trend expected
  to increase.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Asset Manager Valuation Multiples:** The acquisition of Industry Ventures
  by Goldman Sachs (GS) is analyzed through the lens of AUM multiples. Industry Ventures,
  being a fund-of-funds/secondary specialist, commanded a **~10% of AUM multiple**
  (around $970M total deal value for $7B AUM), which is considered standard for this
  hybrid model, contrasting with primary managers (KKR/Carlyle) trading at 20% of
  AUM, and public asset managers trading at 1-2%.

  *   **Strategic Rationale for GS:** Goldman Sachs acquires Industry Ventures to
  gain a platform to push private asset offerings through its Apex platform to HNW/UHNW
  clients, capitalizing on the high-fee nature of private markets compared to shrinking
  public asset management margins.

  *   **Monetizability of VC Firms:** A key distinction is drawn between firms that
  are "asset gatherers" with productizable businesses (like Industry Ventures or potentially
  a media company) versus traditional, partner-dependent venture funds (like a pure
  stock-picking fund), where the latter is inherently **not monetizable** through
  a 100% sale.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Industry Ventures (Hans Morris):** Acquired by Goldman Sachs for up to $970M.
  Praised for building a successful, monetizable asset management machine, particularly
  its secondary business.

  *   **Thinking Machines (Andrew Tulloch):** Co-founder left the AI company (valued
  at $10B post-money) to join Meta for a reported $3.5 billion payout, sparking a
  debate on founder loyalty.

  *   **SoftBank:** Borrowed **$5 billion against its ARM holding** to increase its
  investment exposure in OpenAI, signaling aggressive capital deployment despite existing
  leverage.

  *   **Arthur Rock:** Mentioned as an "OG" of seed investing, serving as a benchmark
  for legendary, direct investors.

  *   **Roger O''Driscoll:** Launched a new fund, prompting discussion on the "hunger"
  of successful VCs and the nature of pure stock-picking funds.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No explicit regulatory discussions were held, but the conversation touched upon
  the **increasingly transactional nature of VC deals**—where relationships are secondary
  to the highest price—which impacts founder expectations and the structure of investment
  agreements.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where:

  1.  **Talent Mobility is Highly Valued:** Founders leaving successful startups for
  massive payouts (even mid-cycle) will become a recognized risk factor, necessitating
  stricter founder vesting and co-founder agreements (e.g., longer cliffs, penalty
  clauses).

  2.  **Asset Management Consolidation:** Large financial institutions (like GS) will
  continue to acquire specialized private asset platforms to secure high-margin revenue
  streams as public market management fees compress.

  3.  **The "Hunger" Question:** LPs will increasingly question the motivation of
  founders who have already achieved massive wealth, potentially leading to scrutiny
  over sustained performance after major liquidity events.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Venture Capitalists (GPs), Limited Partners (LPs), and Senior Tech Founders/Executives.**
  The discussion requires a deep understanding of fund economics, asset management
  valuation, and the dynamics of high-growth startup equity.'
