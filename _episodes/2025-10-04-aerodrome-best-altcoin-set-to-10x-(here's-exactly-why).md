summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Aerodrome BEST Altcoin Set to 10X (Here''s EXACTLY
  Why)


  This 11-minute podcast episode, hosted by "the drooth" on the *Discover Crypto*
  channel, focuses on making a bullish case for **Aerodrome (AERO)**, positioning
  it as a top altcoin poised for significant gains (10X or more) due to its deep integration
  with the Coinbase Base ecosystem.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**:

  The primary focus is on **Layer 2 Scaling Solutions (specifically Coinbase''s Base
  network)** and **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**, centered around the strategic importance
  of Aerodrome as the primary Decentralized Exchange (DEX) within that ecosystem.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Base Network Integration:** Aerodrome has been explicitly chosen by Coinbase
  to serve as the integrated DEX, launchpad, and primary location for all asset pools
  and launches on the Base mainnet.

  *   **Super App Synergy:** Coinbase is aggressively developing its "Base app" into
  a comprehensive financial super app (akin to WeChat), and Aerodrome''s trading execution
  capabilities are being directly embedded into this massive user onboarding mechanism.

  *   **TVL Strength:** The Base ecosystem is showing strong DeFi activity, with Aerodrome
  ranking highly in Total Value Locked (TVL) within the Base chain, competing closely
  with established protocols like Aave and Morpho.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Strategic Positioning:** The speaker argues that Aerodrome is positioned perfectly
  to capture the volume flowing from Coinbase''s massive user base, mirroring the
  excitement and market share captured by Uniswap in the previous cycle.

  *   **Volume Strength:** Aerodrome''s current trading volume is noted as being significantly
  stronger (flatline/up) compared to Uniswap''s volume during a recent market pullback,
  suggesting robust underlying activity.

  *   **Price Target Justification:** Based on a conservative comparison to Uniswap''s
  peak market capitalization during the last cycle, the speaker suggests Aerodrome
  could realistically achieve a $10+ price target, implying substantial upside from
  its current levels (around $1.40 at the time of recording).


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Aerodrome (AERO):** The central subject, touted as the best altcoin investment
  due to its Base integration.

  *   **Coinbase:** The driving force behind the Base network and the entity integrating
  Aerodrome directly into its forthcoming "Base app" super app.

  *   **Uniswap:** Used as the primary historical benchmark for valuation comparison,
  highlighting its previous cycle performance.

  *   **Paul Atkins (SEC):** Mentioned briefly as an indicator that the SEC might
  be opening the door for increased US-based crypto innovation.

  *   **Morpho Labs:** Noted as another high-performing protocol building within the
  Base ecosystem.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  The episode briefly touches on the regulatory environment, noting that the US government
  (via the Department of Justice targeting Binance) appears to be favoring and propping
  up Coinbase as the leading domestic crypto powerhouse, which benefits Aerodrome’s
  integration.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  The conversation suggests the future of US crypto adoption will be heavily centralized
  around major exchange ecosystems like Coinbase, with Layer 2 solutions like Base
  becoming critical infrastructure. Protocols deeply embedded in these centralized
  on-ramps (like Aerodrome) are expected to capture disproportionate value.


  **7. Target Audience**:

  This content is highly valuable for **active crypto investors and traders** focused
  on **altcoin selection, Layer 2 ecosystems, and DeFi protocols** that have strong
  institutional backing or strategic partnerships.


  ---


  **Comprehensive Summary:**


  The podcast episode presents a highly bullish thesis for Aerodrome (AERO), arguing
  it is the best-positioned altcoin to deliver 10X returns based on its foundational
  role within Coinbase''s rapidly expanding Base ecosystem. The main narrative arc
  centers on Coinbase''s strategic pivot toward creating a comprehensive "financial
  super app," replacing its wallet with the Base app, which aims to onboard the next
  billion users into Web3.


  The key insight is that **Aerodrome has been selected as the exclusive, integrated
  Decentralized Exchange (DEX)** within this new Coinbase super app structure. This
  integration means that all on-chain trading activity originating from millions of
  Coinbase users will potentially flow directly through Aerodrome, guaranteeing massive
  transaction volume and revenue capture. The speaker cites reports suggesting Aerodrome''s
  daily revenue is set to surge following these Coinbase integrations, leading to
  predictions of an immediate price slingshot toward $10 per token.


  Technically, the discussion highlights Aerodrome''s strong performance within the
  Base TVL rankings, often surpassing established names like Uniswap in terms of current
  on-chain activity relative to its market cap. The speaker contrasts Aerodrome''s
  current volume strength against Uniswap’s declining volume, despite Uniswap’s significantly
  higher market capitalization from the last cycle.


  From an investment perspective, the host explicitly states they are long AERO, having
  bought dips since $0.18, and believes the project can conservatively achieve half
  the market cap success Uniswap saw in the last cycle. This conservative estimate
  still places the token valuation significantly higher than its current price. The
  episode concludes by framing this opportunity within a broader context of US regulatory
  favor toward Coinbase over competitors like Binance, solidifying Coinbase’s role
  as the primary gateway for US crypto finance, with Aerodrome sitting at the center
  of its DeFi infrastructure. The ultimate advice is for listeners to conduct their
  own research (DYOR) but recognize the tangible, centralized backing Aerodrome possesses.'
