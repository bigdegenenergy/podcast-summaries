summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - Establish a relationship based on mutual value and a desire to help each other
    grow immediately.
  - Do not wait for a negative event to initiate feedback discussions.
  - Start new working relationships by explicitly stating the desire for mutual improvement.
  - Be vulnerable by sharing your own perceived strengths and weaknesses first.
  - Set the expectation that all feedback should be open and welcomed by both parties.
  - Regular, perhaps weekly, feedback should be the established norm, not the exception.
  - Proactive feedback builds psychological safety, making future critical input easier
    to deliver and receive.
  overview: The core message emphasizes proactively establishing a foundation of mutual
    respect and a commitment to growth before any critical feedback is necessary.
    This involves setting expectations early on that continuous, open feedback is
    a valued part of the working relationship, not a reaction to failure. By framing
    feedback as a tool for mutual improvement from the start, difficult conversations
    become normalized and less pressurized.
