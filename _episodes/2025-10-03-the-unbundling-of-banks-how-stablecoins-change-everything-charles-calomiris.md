summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - 'Modern banks are defined by their political reality: they are chartered and regulated
    by the nation-state, making them instruments of political power, not just economic
    functions.'
  - A bank charter is more than a license; it is the outcome of a "bank bargain" coalition
    that defines the entity's powers, limitations, and implicit or explicit loss-sharing
    arrangements (bailouts).
  - The historical evolution of banking, including the shift from specially privileged
    corporations (like the East India Company) to general incorporation, is driven
    by political bargains, not automatic economic processes.
  - The political resistance to stablecoins, evidenced by the Biden administration's
    inaction and the incumbent banks' changing strategies, highlights that technological
    disruption is always mediated by vested political interests.
  - The incumbent banking system's power structure is deeply entrenched, exemplified
    by the $2.5 trillion in contracts between merging banks and activist organizations
    from 1995-2007 to secure political approval for mergers.
  - Stablecoins threaten to unbundle core banking functions, particularly payment
    services, which historically have been bundled with lending due to information
    cost advantages, posing a direct threat to established banks and the Federal Reserve's
    control over payment systems.
  - The ultimate promise of blockchain technology extends beyond medium of exchange
    to creating a new unit of account, which directly challenges the existence of
    chartered central banks like the Federal Reserve.
  overview: Charles Calomiris argues that modern banks are fundamentally political
    entities, chartered by the nation-state as part of a "bargain" that defines their
    powers and loss-sharing arrangements, rather than just abstract financial intermediaries.
    He contends that the rise of stablecoins represents a significant technological
    challenge that threatens to unbundle core banking services, forcing incumbent
    institutions and regulators to engage in political maneuvering to control this
    transformation. Understanding this political history is crucial, as the future
    success of stablecoins depends entirely on navigating the established political
    game of bank bargains, not just technological merit.
