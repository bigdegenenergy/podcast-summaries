summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #1536 Hunter Horsley & Matt Hougan | Did The
  Bitcoin ETF End The 4-Year Cycle?


  This episode of the Pom Podcast features Anthony Pompliano in conversation with
  Hunter Horsley (CEO) and Matt Hougan (CIO) of Bitwise, discussing the profound impact
  of the spot Bitcoin ETFs on market structure, investor behavior, and the traditional
  four-year Bitcoin cycle.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on the **institutionalization of Bitcoin investment** following
  the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Key themes include the shift in investor
  sentiment (retail vs. institutional), the competitive landscape among asset managers,
  Bitwise''s specialized market positioning, and the potential obsolescence of the
  traditional four-year Bitcoin halving cycle due to new capital inflows.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **ETF as the "IPO Moment":** The Bitcoin ETFs served as the crucial inflection
  point, similar to a major company IPO, allowing traditional investors who couldn''t
  use crypto apps to finally consider Bitcoin as a legitimate, tradable asset class.

  *   **Elimination of the "Left Tail Risk":** The ETF structure, backed by regulated
  custodians and major financial institutions, effectively eliminated the existential
  fear (the "left tail risk") that Bitcoin might go to zero, making it palatable for
  conservative investors.

  *   **Diversification of Services:** Bitwise is expanding beyond just the ETF product,
  actively engaging in derivative strategies (like running yield strategies for institutional
  SMAs) and supporting staking infrastructure (evidenced by their acquisition of Atestant),
  signaling a move toward comprehensive crypto asset management.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Universal Adoption of the ETF:** The spot Bitcoin ETF has become the primary
  tool for *everyone*—retail, hedge funds (for basis trading), RIAs, and family offices—due
  to its low cost (20 bps for Bitwise) and integrated structure.

  *   **Divergent Sentiment:** There is a stark divergence: retail investors feel
  lukewarm or sad, while institutional investors are experiencing the "best time ever"
  due to multi-year adoption timelines, regulatory clarity (fewer SEC lawsuits), and
  the ETF launch. Institutions are currently "right."

  *   **Private Wealth Onboarding Timeline:** The onboarding process for large wirehouses
  is slow but inevitable. RIAs are already allocating 2.5% to 5%, and the larger,
  slower wirehouses are showing massive internal senior-level engagement, suggesting
  significant future inflows.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Bitwise:** Highlighted for successfully competing against giants like BlackRock
  and Fidelity by positioning itself as a **crypto specialist** trusted by the community
  for retaining Bitcoin''s "soul" (e.g., donating to open-source developers).

  *   **BlackRock/Fidelity:** Mentioned as the major incumbent firms leveraging massive
  distribution power in the ETF space.

  *   **Atestant:** Bitwise''s acquisition, known for developing open-source Ethereum
  staking libraries (Dirk and Vouch), showcasing Bitwise''s commitment to supporting
  broader crypto infrastructure.

  *   **Sovereign Wealth Funds (Abu Dhabi):** Noted for buying the ETF to gain quick
  price exposure, suggesting a future where large pools of capital hold both regulated
  ETPs and self-custodied assets (mirroring the gold market).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The conversation notes that the **election** in November is seen as the next major
  catalyst, potentially accelerating institutional adoption even further by changing
  the regulatory landscape. The consistent removal of SEC lawsuits against crypto
  entities is cited as a positive sign of improving regulatory clarity, which institutions
  value highly.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The traditional **four-year Bitcoin cycle is likely over**. The ETF inflows represent
  a larger, longer-term capital base than the previous retail-driven cycles (2011,
  2015, 2019). This new cycle is expected to be much longer, with strong years predicted
  through 2027, bulldozing over any natural pullbacks caused by leverage cycling out.
  The industry is moving toward a dual structure where investors hold both regulated
