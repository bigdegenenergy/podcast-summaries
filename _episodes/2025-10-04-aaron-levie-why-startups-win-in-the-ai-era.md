    can have AI agents that effectively contain the labor of that job function in
    the software itself. So you can go to a company and you can say, I know you only

summary:
- key_takeaways:
  - The next 1-3 years represent a unique, closing window for startups to build hundreds
    of great companies leveraging AI agents.
  - AI agents are uniquely positioned to unlock value from unstructured enterprise
    data (documents, contracts), turning it into an operational asset.
  - Contrary to job loss fears, AI will primarily automate 'necessary but not strategic'
    work, freeing up employees for high-impact innovation and customer engagement.
  - The shift from cloud to AI is different because enterprise buy-in for AI's future
    is already widespread, unlike the initial skepticism around cloud computing.
  - New business models will pivot from seat-based licensing (SaaS) to consumption-based
    pricing, tied to the volume of work performed by AI agents.
  - Startups should focus on solving entirely new categories of work that software
    couldn't touch before, rather than simply adding AI features to existing software
    categories (e.g., CRM with AI).
  - Companies in the AI space benefit from deflationary economics where raw material
    costs (tokens) decrease over time, allowing for high margins on the surrounding
    workflow software.
  overview: Aaron Levie discusses the current AI era as a critical window for startups
    to build the next generation of foundational companies by automating previously
    impossible tasks involving unstructured data. He contrasts the AI adoption curve
    with the cloud transition, noting that while cloud required convincing enterprises
    of its safety, AI is already widely accepted, shifting the focus to reliable implementation
    and workflow automation. Levie argues that AI agents will free up human workers
    from non-strategic tasks, enabling companies to pursue more ambitious, high-impact
    work that was previously economically unviable.
