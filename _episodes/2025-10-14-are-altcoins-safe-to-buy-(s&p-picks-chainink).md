    do if you're a crypto investor, especially if you believe like I do that Bitcoin
    is going into the millions in the long term

    Global to assess stablecoin stability, directly addressing recent market instability
    concerns.

  text: They have global markets as well, tapping Chainlink to rate the stablecoin's
    ability to retain peg, and TJ, what coincidental timing after the large de-peg
    events of just four or five days ago.
  topic: technology/regulation
- impact_reason: Provides a key insight into the mechanics of the recent market crash,
    attributing severe drops to coordinated liquidity withdrawal by market makers,
    rather than just organic selling.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It does appear we're getting more data now that there was a market maker or
    market makers that sucked a lot of the liquidity out of the market all at the
    same time, exacerbating the issue, driving the prices down even more.
  topic: investment/technology
- impact_reason: Explains the extreme volatility and cascading liquidations seen in
    low-liquidity altcoins during stress events, specifically mentioning the danger
    of using cross-margin with low-cap assets as collateral.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you start to get liquidated and the liquidity is already sucked out of
    the market, that's what those altcoins should just get absolutely [wiped out].
    So if you've got, say you've got... somebody's got $10 million of fart coin in
    their account, but they're trading on a Bitcoin pair, but they're using cross
    and some of that collateral is in a low liquidity altcoin or a meme coin, and
    then you start to get liquidated and the market makers pulled the liquidity, that's
    what's going to cause it to crash down 80%, 90% to some of these ridiculous prices
    that we saw.
  topic: defi/investment

    infrastructure (Chainlink) for critical financial functions (stablecoin risk assessment).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: They partnered with Chainlink to get financial institutions, AKA the big banks,
    AKA Wall Street, on-chain access to stablecoin stability assessments.

    infrastructure (Chainlink) for critical financial data (stablecoin risk assessment).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So they partnered with Chainlink to get financial institutions, AKA the big
    banks, AKA Wall Street, on-chain access to stablecoin stability assessments.
  topic: Adoption/Technology
- impact_reason: A significant prediction challenging the traditional Bitcoin four-year
    cycle model, suggesting institutional influence will lead to a more systematic,
    S&P-like market structure.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If they're going to bring that same mentality to crypto, that's part of what's
    driving a lot of the narrative that the four-year cycle is over. We'll have accumulation
    periods, and then we'll pump, and we'll have some structured pullbacks and some
    healthy resets, but we're not going to get the clear four-year cycle of up only,
    down only, sideways only, slow up, big up. That's basically the four-year cycle,
    and that I do think is coming to an end.
  topic: Market Trends/Adoption
- impact_reason: Offers a strong conjecture that the recent stablecoin de-pegging
    event was a deliberate stress test or attack vector against Aave's collateralization
    via the Athena stablecoin.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But I do believe part of what was going on when they pulled that liquidity
    was trying to break Athena and trying to get it to come up. Because if Athena
    broke and really significantly didn't recover its peg, a huge amount of Aave's
    collateral right now is Athena.
  topic: DeFi/Strategy
- impact_reason: Strong, direct warning against trading around major macroeconomic
    events (Powell speeches) due to extreme volatility, using vivid cautionary language.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Be careful trading leading up to this. Powell is going to step up 12:20 Eastern
    Standard Time. So, we're looking about an hour and a half from now. Markets in
    full suspense mode. Are you playing it safe right in the volatility? Careful riding
    the lightning, man. Careful trying to ride that lightning. It might end up you
    might be the thunder clap, but it's just your ass hitting the ground.
  topic: Strategy/Investment
- impact_reason: A clear bullish accumulation thesis for altcoins following a market
    flush-out of leverage.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I do think a risk-reward right now on altcoins now is a good time to be buying
    and accumulating. Even if we do go slightly lower on Bitcoin, seeing all that
    wet leverage wiped out, seeing, you know, all the charts get basically crushed,
    doesn't make me scared of altcoins. It actually makes me say, like, 'Okay, actually,
    these are pretty good entries.'
  topic: Investment/DeFi
- impact_reason: Highlights a major market player making a massive, leveraged bearish
    bet, signaling potential near-term downside risk.

  text: Bitcoin whale shorted the last crash. Remember, he made $192 million. He has
    now opened a short and then even boosted the bet slamming down $400 million that
    Bitcoin's going to tank.
  topic: Investment
- impact_reason: Suggests coordinated market manipulation involving multiple factors
    beyond a single political event, pointing to institutional/large player coordination
    (mentioning Wintermute liquidity pull).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I do think it had somebody had prior knowledge. Definitely people had prior
    knowledge because it was a lot more going on than just the Trump tweet. And that's
    part of what I talked about yesterday is I don't know if he knew anything about
    Trump stuff, but they probably knew that Wintermute was going to pull all their
    liquidity.
  topic: Regulation/Investment
- impact_reason: 'This is a core philosophical argument for Bitcoin''s value proposition:
    its intrinsic link to real-world, un-printable energy contrasts sharply with infinitely
    printable fiat currency.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But you can't print energy, true. That's why Bitcoin is based on energy. You
    can always print more money. You can always issue fake fiat currency, and every
    government in history has done so. But it is impossible to fake energy.
  topic: Technology/Investment Thesis
- impact_reason: Reiterates the fundamental thesis of Bitcoin as an energy/value storage
    layer, which can then be leveraged for other opportunities.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Bitcoin is the best way coming back to storing your wealth or storing your
    energy. That's what Bitcoin does best. It stores energy for the future, stores
    value, and builds up your energy supply that you can deploy into other things
    later.
  topic: Investment Thesis
- impact_reason: Draws a direct historical line from the end of the gold standard
    to massive increases in national debt and inflation/affordability crises, reinforcing
    the argument for sound money.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: USA removed all silver bummer coins in '65, closed the gold window in '71,
    which removed backing of gold. After that, they unleashed debt up to almost $40
    trillion. So, if you wonder why housing's unaffordable, everything seems more
    expensive, it's because your currency is being devalued a little each year.
  topic: Adoption/Investment Thesis
- impact_reason: Strong endorsement of 'The Bitcoin Standard' thesis, linking currency
    debasement directly to civilizational decline, which is the ultimate driver for
    seeking decentralized, hard money like Bitcoin.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you guys haven't read The Bitcoin Standard yet, I would recommend it because
    it's almost always the beginning of the end of powerhouse civilizations is when
    they start to be basing the currency. Once they get away from a sound money or
    a hard money supply, that's when everything starts to fall apart...
  topic: Adoption/Strategy
- impact_reason: Directly addresses the primary fear and uncertainty in the current
    altcoin market, setting the stage for market analysis.
  relevance_score: 9

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Are Altcoins Safe To Buy? (S&P Picks Chainlink)


  This 64-minute podcast episode provided a deep dive into the current state of the
  cryptocurrency market, focusing heavily on altcoin safety, technical analysis, and
  significant institutional developments, particularly involving Chainlink. The hosts
  addressed immediate market volatility following a recent sell-off and offered forward-looking
  perspectives on potential market catalysts.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area:**

  The primary focus was **Cryptocurrency Market Analysis and Investment Strategy**,
  specifically addressing the safety and viability of buying altcoins amidst market
  downturns. Secondary topics included technical indicators (RSI, Wyckoff patterns),
  institutional adoption (Chainlink/S&P), and macroeconomic factors (Fed policy, potential
  government shutdown impact).


  **2. Key Technical Insights:**

  *   **Bitcoin Range & RSI Divergence:** Bitcoin was observed bouncing strongly off
  the $110k level (implied range context), with analysis showing clear bearish divergence
  on the RSI at the top, and potential hidden bullish divergence suggesting a recovery
  within 24-72 hours.

  *   **Chainlink W Formation:** The LINK chart displayed a pattern highly similar
  to its 2020 run-up—a "W formation" followed by a downside wick that washed out longs,
  suggesting potential for a significant move upward.

  *   **Altcoin Rotation & Strength:** Solana was noted for outperforming peers during
  the recent drawdown, indicating potential strength ahead, possibly tied to upcoming
  ETF news. Strong performers during the dip included **Tau (Origin Trail)**.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle:**

  *   **Altcoin Safety Question:** The central theme was whether "alt season" is a
  myth or real, with the hosts suggesting that leverage has been flushed out, setting
  the stage for a more structured move upward once catalysts hit.

  *   **Institutional Entry Strategy:** The hosts posited that institutions might
  be deliberately accumulating positions during current pullbacks to secure better
  entries before a major rally.

  *   **BNB as an Altcoin Catalyst:** There was speculation that **BNB**, rather than
  Ethereum, might be the primary driver kicking off the next major altcoin season,
  with profits rotating down into the BNB ecosystem (e.g., ASTR, PancakeSwap).


  **4. Notable Companies/People:**

  *   **Chainlink (LINK):** Highlighted as the "title story" due to its partnership
  with **S&P Global** to provide **Stablecoin Stability Assessments (SSAs)** on the
  Base network, powered by **DataLink**.

  *   **S&P Global:** The entity behind the S&P 500, tapping Chainlink for institutional-grade
  risk assessment data for stablecoins.

  *   **Crypto.com & PayPal:** Mentioned in context of previous content releases by
  the channel.

  *   **Scott Melker:** Referenced for pointing out the bearish divergence on Bitcoin''s
  RSI.

  *   **CryptoFace:** Mentioned as a guest expected on afternoon streams to discuss
  market drivers.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  *   The **Clarity Act** establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins was
  cited as a factor increasing demand for real-time risk profiles like Chainlink''s
  SSAs.

  *   The potential impact of the **US government shutdown** ending was viewed as
  a bullish catalyst for altcoins, especially pending ETF approvals.

  *   There was discussion of **China urging the US to correct 100% tariffs**, linking
  this to a potential "Terra playbook" step involving anticipated trade deal teasers
  from the Trump administration.


  **6. Future Implications:**

  The conversation suggests a shift away from strict four-year crypto cycles toward
  a more systematic, S&P 500-like trajectory characterized by structured pullbacks
  and steady accumulation phases, driven by increasing institutional integration.
  Chainlink’s role in providing essential risk infrastructure for regulated finance
  is seen as a major long-term driver.


  **7. Target Audience:**

  This episode is most valuable for **Active Cryptocurrency Traders and Investors**
  who utilize technical analysis, monitor institutional on-ramps, and are making strategic
  decisions about portfolio allocation between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and specific high-potential
  altcoins (like LINK and BNB).'
