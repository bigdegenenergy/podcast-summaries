    a warhead or crude nuclear device and according to estimates from both US government
    sources and nuclear experts it would take about four to six months for aron to
    develop a crude nuclear device right this is something that you wouldn't use a
    missile to deliver but you'd use a plane or a ship and it would take somewhere
    in the neighborhood of about a year and a half to deliver or to develop a warhead
    and that's to a fix to the missile so it's sort of the three legs of the nuclear
    stool right the weapons grade uranium the missiles to deliver it and the and the
    warhead so I just want to sort of define terms so that when we're having this

  confidence: medium
  extracted: have stayed in the deal because I thought you gave us some important
    restrictions on the short term certain leverage but Trump decides to withdraw
    from that agreement because he recognizes that the fatal flaw of the agreement
    the fatal flaws of the agreement are one giving them any enrichment capability
    especially an industrial size within 15 years right and two are these sunsets
    as Scott said which under which these restrictions are going to go away and Iran's
    going to end end up with a massive nuclear program but I think that's just important
    we can talk about the JCPA the process and everything else if you're interested
    I'd like to go ahead and quickly accuse the FBI and the CIA of framing Trump for
    treason with Russia and pushing the Russia gate hoax I'm trying to agree with
    my friend here because what it is is that that completely ruined Donald Trump's
    ability to engage in real diplomacy with Russia for his entire first term certainly
    for the first three years of it he was completely handcuffed it was it was it
    was it was it was terrible as I'm sure you're well aware for the future now our
    past and current history of Ukraine as well as for this deal too why couldn't
    Trump pick up the phone I don't know the details here but I'll take his word for
    it that the British and the French and the Germans weren't being nice to Trump
    they didn't like him they didn't want to do it why couldn't he pick the pick up
    the phone and say hey Putin I need you to call the Iatola for me and tell him
    hey you'd like to see him lift these sunsets too and this and that why because
    they framed him for treason so he was completely unable to engage in real diplomacy
    with Russia and I bet that he'd agree with me on that one too so next actually
    can I just say one thing interesting and again I think it's going to be a later
    topic and so it's going to be a provocative statement but I think let's put it
    on the table I absolutely agree with Scott I mean I think it was a travesty that
    the of the accusations against Donald Trump as a Russian agent I mean completely
    debunked but it did it I think it paralyzed his presidency for two two and a half
    years I agree with Scott the idea that you would accuse the president of the United
    States of being a foreign agent for Vladimir Putin I think is unfounded and I
    thought at the time just graceful and I thought it was really important I think
    Scott did really good work and into banking that I would say that just a couple
    days ago I was watching a podcast Scott was on and you used Trump being an agent
    for Netanyahu and the Israeli government so I think again the accusations of the
    president of the States as a foreign agent for some foreign government I think
    we should just put all of that aside in any discussion and just say president
    Trump makes his own decisions whether we agree with them or agree with them but
    he's not working for the FSB and he's not working for more side president Trump
    makes his own decisions based on American national security now I was making a
    point that's hyperbole making a point but he did in fact could you google this
    for me because I always forget exactly how many hundreds of millions of dollars
    that he took from Sheldon Adelson and Miriam Adelson who are Americans by the
    way who are Americans who Sheldon Adelson said his only regret in life is that
    he served in the American army instead of the IDF and said America should nuke
    Iran in order to get them to give up their nuclear weapons he said I have one
    issue one Israel and they gave Trump hundreds of millions of dollars over three
    campaigns that's not just a jeez I really hope you'll think of me in the future
    Scott first of a couple things so one there's a lot of people that are friends
    with Trump and try to gain influence I believe that Trump is an American is making
    his own decisions let's for the purpose of this conversation just focus on that
    and see what are the right decisions and what are the wrong decisions and maybe
    I wonder what decisions I could get you to make if I gave you hundreds of millions
    of dollars well me personally you couldn't give me it doesn't matter I couldn't
    even get you I couldn't get you drop in on a verb ramp or nothing for a hundred
    million bucks nothing you cannot control my decisions with money it's the American
    system Lex that's how it works it's money that's right yeah we can go down that
    right same if we were talking about archer Daniels middling company throwing hundreds
    of millions of dollars around they get policies based on their hundreds of millions
    of dollars the squeaky wheel gets the grease right all that so Lex I think you're
    right I mean I think you'll I must spend what four million dollars to helping
    Trump get elected and obviously there are a number of philanthropists I think
    clearly his son Don juniors had a lot of influence and who gets selected in these
    positions in the panaghan and a sea and Tucker Colson has had a lot of influence
    so I think as you say there's he surrounds himself with people who have certain
    ideas ideologies policies the president makes these own just I just want to touch
    on just one thing because I I don't want to leave this alone just out of respect
    for for the victims of Iran backed terrorism and hostage taking and assassinations
    since 1979 you know this is the regime that took our took hostages in 79 took
    our diplomats hostage um Scott says you know 83 was really the only thing that
    happened and and throws out a lot of information certainly some some pretty breathtaking
    accusations that some of the Israelis knew about this and didn't tell the Americans
    and some assault officers accusation yeah Victor Australia is his name yeah I
    know exactly who he is and and he's been widely discredited and having an axe
    to grind with with more side but anyway I'm not only 83 but all through the 90s
    the 2000s 2010s 2020s there have been hundreds of attacks of assassinations of
    hostage taking there are thousands Americans who have been killed and maimed by
    the regime can you be specific what you're talking about I mean I can give you
    a whole list sure literally I'm happy to pull it up Lex I shared it with you it's
    a long list of attacks all through the 80s and 90s and really I mean everything
    from the you know co bar towers the two bar towers well kita can I that was a
    song of been London college shake moham's got let him lay it off all right let's
    hear yeah oh I got my pen in my hand go ahead and again according again according
    to you as intelligence fighting it was actually his bala that worked with al-Qaeda
    trained al-Qaeda in that attack and the co bar towers um they were they were kidnapping
    our diplomats in Beirut um they were they launched attacks against our our soldiers
    while in Iraq the notion that's not to bunk that no I don't I don't think what
    you say you debunked it you you just made your claim um but those were a run-backed
    malicious um backed by the cut by custom solomani who's got referred to who was
    the commander of the rgc kud's force who supplied them with those ied's or those
    eft's actually those explosive well okay again this has been all confirmed by
    one of you search alissa rubin new york times eft factory or you can look in the

    what you can it's easy to find in my book you can flip right to soda straws and

    hear yeah oh I got my pen in my hand go ahead and again according again according
    to you as intelligence fighting it was actually his bala that worked with al-Qaeda
    trained al-Qaeda in that attack and the co bar towers um they were they were kidnapping
    our diplomats in Beirut um they were they launched attacks against our our soldiers
    while in Iraq the notion that's not to bunk that no I don't I don't think what
    you say you debunked it you you just made your claim um but those were a run-backed
    malicious um backed by the cut by custom solomani who's got referred to who was
    the commander of the rgc kud's force who supplied them with those ied's or those
    eft's actually those explosive well okay again this has been all confirmed by
    one of you search alissa rubin new york times eft factory or you can look in the
    christian science monitor operation eagle claw yeah where they found these things
    what you can it's easy to find in my book you can flip right to soda straws and
    eft's and you see where I I have all my citations for the solid dozen american
    newspaper reporters who were embedded with american soldiers who found these factories
    in a rocky shea stand okay with irraqi arab's work in the machines not iran so
    i'd like your viewers to to google not just a couple of sources but actually google
    the u.
  type: recommendation
- actionable: true
  confidence: medium
  extracted: talk about it actually that's a good cue take about let's take about
    the break okay we took a quick break and i'll uh scot yeah okay so a few things
    there first of all on amad the pre-2003 nuclear weapons research the cia estimate
    in 2007 concluded that all research had stopped in 2003 and seymour hersh reported
    that the reasoning behind that was mainly that america got rid of sedom who sane
    for them now in gareth portris book manufactured crisis he shows that the major
    conclusion that the uh d i a had made that the iranians were researching nuclear
    weapons was based on some invoices that they had intercepted for some dual use
    materials some specialty magnets and things that they thought boy this looks like
    this could be part of of weapon station program a secret program here and you
    know gareth portris a really great critic of all of these policies and claims
    says hey this was a good faith misunderstanding by d i a they were doing their
    job but it turned out the i a a later when america gave them that information
    the i a a went and verified oh there's the magnet and there's this and there's
    that and all those dual use items actually were being used for civilian purposes
    and so then um as gareth writes in his book the only real reason that the n i
    e said that they even had a program before 2003 was essentially because they didn't
    want to dispute their last mistaken conclusion so they said okay well that was
    right up until then but that was when that changed and then the other half of
    their reason for accepting that there ever was a nuclear weapons research program
    uh in the country before 2003 was the smoking laptop and i'm sorry i think i misspoke
    early when i said that the laptop was in 2005 that's just the Washington Post
    story that had a bunch of stuff about it that was in 2003 as well or 2004 possibly
    so this was why the um but it was still all again forged by the israelis and funneled
    through the m e k cult um but was obsolete essentially and had nothing in it at
    least the accusations and it weren't past 03 and so there's really no reason believe
    that there was actually a nuclear weapons research program even before 03 which
    then again the national intelligence council says ended in 2003 and hasn't been
    restored to this question just not a comment by me but a question just your perspective
    so just so i understand this so the the nuclear archive this this massive archive
    that the israelisrael to take out of taeron bring to the united states bring to
    the i a e a which is very detailed blueprints it's just the alleged studies documents
    again it's the same stuff from the smoking laptop yeah so let me just ask you
    because it's it's huge and it's very detailed and it shows clearly that the aeron
    had an active nuclear weapons program certainly until 2003 and then we can have
    a discussion about what happened after that are you suggesting that that's all
    been forged by by israel yes nothing in the smoking all felt that not the not
    the laptop but this entire archive that they pulled out with this you're you're
    thinking of like blueprints the big photo op with all the dot all the four documents
    i've seen it i've seen it i've seen many of the documents there's thousands of
    pages i'm asking this is not what i'm claiming is that all forged is that is that
    not all about the uranium tetra fluoride and the warhead that david albright debunked
    and all the same claims that were in the smoking laptop from the bushiers david
    david david albright actually already entire book it's a very detailed book your
    listeners should google it's it's david albright on the archive where he goes
    in he went in in detail and he confirms the information in that archive that aeron
    had an active program under something called a mod to develop five atomic weapons
    so i again you and i can debate this all day now this would have been before in
    a taunts was even dug and before it's a central center future spinning right get
    all that i'm just making sure everybody understands assuming that was true we're
    talking about a piece of paper but you you you but it's not a piece of paper it's
    a massive archive i'm just asking the question you you believe more side fabricated
    all of this as a lie to deceive the united states the ia ea and international
    community that's just my question my understanding is that there's nothing significant
    in the 2018 archive that was not already in the debunked claims from the laptop
    but my question is is not that it's debunked because we can argue about whether
    it's debunked but are you saying that most side fabricated it yeah that's where
    you're claiming yeah because the cia admitted that there was no laptop and all
    he hindered admitted that he got it from the mck and where did the mck get it
    the mck got it from the israeli it's got him i asked him at the laptop i'm asking
    about this huge archive that was sitting in a warehouse in taeron full i don't
    know the truth behind those documents i don't believe israeli claims of what they
    were and where they came from without for example reading all brights book and
    seeing what he has to say about all of that i don't take netanyahu's claims and
    and okay so what's so significant in there you say that there's a document that
    has a plan to to make five bombs but isn't the rest of the proof the same green
    salt experiments and the warhead for the missile that david albright showed was
    obviously fake because the warhead was purportedly being designed for a missile
    that was now going to have an entirely different nose cone on it now so david
    albright again you know we should bring david albright here david albright as
    a prominent physicist nuclear proliferation expert known for his detailed research
    publication of nuclear weapons he has a bunch of books peddling peril irons perils
    pursuit of nuclear weapons plutonium and haleen rich uranium 1996 and so on yeah
    so so folks should read the book on the on the archive because david had full
    access to the archive all the all the detailed documents and blueprints and he
    writes a book that again the conclusion of which is iron had an active nuclear
    weapons program no no the conclusion was they were researching it right before
    2003 they had no nuclear material to introduce into a single machine right well
    they active programming now they had a they had already built a covert enrichment
    facility which was only they hadn't it was closed netons was empty by till the
    end of 2006 right they didn't even spin some screws in there until they they got
    in centrifuge for acucon they'd built a deeply buried underground facility at
    netons they were putting in place the component parts for a nuclear weapons capability
    and a mod showed conclusively unless you believe most side fabricated at all that
    they actually had the plan to build nuclear warhead again see more her says that
    it was when see more her she's not a nuclear weapons expert david albright has
    the archive your hersha s sources said you're claiming America invaded Iraq and
    overthrew sedom who's saying for them that was when they gave up even considering
    the need for it remember the Iranians held a million man vigil for the Americans
    on september 11th the Iranians hated the Taliban in fact the Americans thought
    iron might invade Afghanistan earlier in 2001 and they hated sedom who's saying
    so they had every reason in the world to want to work with the United States that's
    a distraction and the American you it says distraction my question is here let's
    not go to al-Qaeda the Taliban and 9-11 and the Iranians and a million people
    vigil let's just stay on the top you're asking me what I already am you believe
    was I fabricated that entire already told you I don't take their word for anything
    and I'd have as far as I understand the accusations in there are the same ones
    from the laptop that are already discredited and I haven't read david al-Bright's
    book you're distracting from me refuting this giant list of false claims that
    you made previously that's all agreed that's all the great you're going to read
    the book maybe lex you're going to read the book viewers you should read the book
    I think david al-Bright has done a meticulous job it's a by the way just just
    warning it's a big book very detailed hundreds of pages and he goes through it
    in meticulous detail in analyzing this archive and showed again that aron had
    an active nuclear weapons program designed to build five atomic warheads now we
    can talk about what happened after 2003 and did they make the decision to totally
    stop it yeah god changed this mind after the neo conservatives lied america in
    the war with the rock for aerial shirone so it's just a clarify you mark it and
    david al-Bright believe that aron was developing a nuclear weapon and you skydder
    saying they were not before 2003 that's just just to summarize what we're just
    talking about well I could tell you that so garis book came out in 2014 which
    is before this archive was supposedly revealed in tae ron but in in garis book
    he shows that the cia and national intelligence estimate of 2007 that said that
    there was a program before 2003 and was halted after america invaded iraq was
    based on one the the the dia's mistaken but sincere interpretation of these invoices
    for these to use technologies and then the smoking laptop which was completely
    fake and funneled into the stream by the moujadine e-colk communist terrorist
    cult the same people who come off with you know ten major hopes then cri they
    just put out then cri the national council for assistance in iran that's the mk
    they just put out a fake story what three four weeks ago about a big secret nuclear
    weapons site in iran don't you remember and then nothing happened with that because
    it was another lie by the mk happens all the time so lex maybe we should talk
    about what happened after 2003 what about this 2007 and i what does it mean did
    it mean iran had now abandoned its nuclear weapons program or does something else
    never had a nuclear weapons program but let's talk about that they had interesting
    interesting according to the n i e they had a nuclear weapons research program
    that never made anything at all so you can try to conflate that if you want that's
    what i think everybody can see what you do in 2007 and i says what the 2007 and
    i e says is that and you are correct according to the 2007 n i e is iran made
    the decision after the invasion of iraq not to pursue an active nuclear weapons
    program anymore because we were putting their best friends and power in tae ron
    in backdad for them well because the united states are on it and worry no more
    and in a matter of a hundred days had taken down the iraqi army and that put in
    Abdulaziz al-Hakim's faction that's fine for Islamic revolution in iraq who've
    been living in iran for 20 years that's why you and i did not publicly support
    the iraq war did we i publicly opposed it good for you as opposed to i should
    have publicly opposed it rather than just working on iran in 2003 but you're right
    it redounded to the benefit of iran that invasion but but that's not actually
    what i'm talking about what i'm talking about is a hundred days the iranian sea
    that the u
  text: we should talk about it actually that's a good cue take about let's take about
    the break okay we took a quick break and i'll uh scot yeah okay so a few things

    just the other day that if we get rid of the aia tolla that will solve all the
    problems which is just crazy to think that they have Israeli officials have been
    tweeting out pictures and piling around with the son of the shaw talking about
    reinstalling his royal majesty's monarchy sock puppet dictator ship that's taking
    back iran for the people of iran giving them over to a bunch of foreign backed
    exiles try was that what trump meant when he gave that speech and cutters saying
    we don't believe in neo conservatism and spreading democracy anymore he's just
    setting up because we're going to try to reinstall a monarch can you go into the
    analysis of best case and worst case you laid out the best case what so worst
    case would be the worst case is this that i hear that what was the worst case
    i i miss the best case is a deal yeah that we quit now the deal that basically
    you guys agree on the on the best yeah i mean we respect their right to a civilian
    nuclear program and tried to negotiate as i said back into something like the
    jcpo which again had them exporting their entire style no so uranium out of the
    country he wants no nuclear program what so no that's not what i said there's
    no i said we'd be careful what i said well no enrichment capability i said right
    to retire dependence on other countries to supply their fuel and you can you teach
    me the difference yeah so let me just step back from this because we agree on
    some and we disagree on a major issue and that if we both agree iran deserves
    a civilian nuclear program i told is never going to give in on enrichment can
    i just we know that okay so premise for our whole discussion here okay therefore
    what he's saying is we're going to have to keep escalating the war until the mission
    is accomplished i said that Scott i think it's again important the the distinction
    here right we both agree that iran deserves a civilian nuclear program 23 countries
    have civilian nuclear programs and they don't have enrichment and they don't have
    reprocessing where we differ is i don't think iran should have the iran standard
    i think that should iran should agree to the gold standard the 23 us allies have
    agreed to so have civilian nuclear program but you don't get to keep the key enrichment
    and reprocessing capabilities that you need to develop nuclear weapons do you
    think that bill Clinton should have just let the Chinese sell them the light water
    reactor that they wanted to back in the 90s yeah an america of course allowed
    russia to sell them a heavy water reactor for the same purpose but i agree with
    Scott that i think one of the ways are out of this is yes whether it's the Chinese
    or preferably as an american i prefer the americans actually sell reactors to
    the iranians is great in a nuclear industry in this country let's do that but
    if they can't the south korean's can the russians can the chinese can i wouldn't
    want to have significant russian and chinese influence in iran so better that
    it be a western country that does it nevertheless provide those reactors in their
    proliferation proof there's no enrichment and no reprocessing you buy your fuel
    rods from abroad you put them in the reactors you power the iranian electrical
    grid which is in terrible shape because the i told the has spent a half a trillion
    dollars trying to build nuclear weapons and not trying to provide electricity
    for his people let's help him let's help his people get electricity but the key
    difference in our argument and it's a fundamental difference got's right like
    the key difference is i do not want to give this regime enrichment or reprocessing
    because they have shown over time for whatever reason whether you believe it's
    they intended to where we were lying about it or we broke them it doesn't matter
    what they have shown over the past number of years is they have gone up from three
    point six seven percent in rich iranian for civilian purpose all the way up to
    sixty percent which is ninety nine percent of what you need for weapons great
    since we've seen them do it before we don't want to see them do it again so no
    enrichment full this mantle meant full deal and then there's a peaceful resolution
    to what i what i worry about is positions that are taken that under my president
    trumps negotiating leverage in a month because can i ask you you were saying you
    support the jc you were opposed to yeah we're opposed yeah you were opposed to
    withdrawing from it yeah don't you think that trump could have gone over there
    and negotiate to make it better and would you agree that it was a huge mistake
    to withdraw that because they were as we agreed shipping out all of their enriched
    uranium to only be brought back in a form that they could not use to make nukes
    the scientists had decided that if they kicked all the inspectors out and beat
    their chest and started making a new it would take them a full year to have enough
    weapons great uranium for a single gun type new under the jcp away right so can
    i let me answer your question yeah because you're right i mean i'm glad you've
    pointed out because i i try to take a nuanced position in during the jcp away
    debate and i got hammered by the left and i got hammered by the right okay the
    the the left hammered me because i criticized the jcp away because it's fundamental
    flaw with twofold one it gave eran enrichment capability that would expand over
    time as the restriction sunset it right and number two the restri the sunsets
    were going to kick in and eran would emerge with this industrial size program
    which we would not be able to stop now the nuanced position which i got hammered
    on by the right was i said go negotiate with the Europeans agree on a common transatlantic
    position to approach the eranians and say look that deal that we did back in 2015
    we think it's flawed we want to extend that deal we want to get rid of the sunsets
    and we are going to negotiate a deal now does that mean we have to give you more
    sanctions relief yeah probably the reins are not going to just agree without sanctions
    relief what happened is the Trump administration tried to negotiate with the Europeans
    the Europeans were opposed because they didn't want to revisit the agreement we
    knew from we knew that eranians were completely opposed and there was no way they
    were going to do this if the United States and Europe were divided and so at that
    what's i'm just just a little bit of history i just think it's interesting history
    it was at that point that president tried to decide it to withdraw from the agreement
    but what i'm asking you is if say you were the national security advisor under
    the jcpoa where they are still shipping all their enriched uranium out of the
    country and all that which you you would be advising him to not leave in the negotiations
    to improve the deal would you have been willing to accept some level of enrichment
    then as long as we're still we have the restriction part where they're shipping
    it all out of the country or to you enrichment at all is always a red line essentially
    equivalent to them being 99% of the way to a nuclear weapon it look enrichment
    capability is a red line it has to be a red line and and even though you know
    it's protected by the MPT the right to piece of nuclear technology they call it
    a loophole but well they have the right to enrich uranium as there's different
    interpretations of everything including agreements there is a a a raging debate
    about whether the npt actually gives you a right to enrich in fact the Obama administration
    even with the jcpoa wasn't was not willing to recognize a ron's right to enrich
    but they were willing to recognize its de facto reality that they were enriching
    so it's the non-proliferation treaty ron is a member of it and it is supposed
    to promote civilian peaceful civilian nuclear energy and it's supposed to prevent
    countries from developing nuclear weapons I think that's a basic summary of it
    and it mandates that non nuclear weapons states have a safe guards agreement with
    the ia ea and full of additional protocols and whatever they have the right to
    suspect well no they had an additional protocol that they were biting not even
    enriching at all while they were negotiating with the e3 and then with the jcpoa
    really did was add a bunch of additional protocols and subsidiary arrangements
    agreements to ratify additional protocol I just want to just be clear on the facts
    I mean it's really important which point in time did they refuse to ratify because
    they did ratify the jcpoa which was full of additional protocols and and subsidiary
    arrangements and agreements they're called there's there's an important additional
    protocol that are on refused which one was that the one where they promised not
    to enrich at all which they actually did abide by while they were negotiating
    with the e3 in the w bush years before they even started spinning central defense
    you asked me what I would advise the national security advisor the United States
    or if I was the national security advisor the United States which I guess I can't
    be because I'm a foreigner but the fact of the matter is I think you could still
    be national security advisor so big nebrzinski sure was I think he was taking
    a shot back at the fact that you took a shot you know what looks I think that
    you probably would recognize that there are many people who lobby for israel's
    interests in the United States who clearly don't care that much about what happens
    to the United States of America in it as a consequence because they care about
    israel which is a different country than America right it's not part of I think
    it's an American an American citizen cares primarily about America that is fundamentally
    for me to make an accusation that they don't requires a very large amount of proof
    for each individual I don't care in that American and israel's interests are the
    same requires a tremendous amount of cognitive dissonance by those who support
    israel's interests they say they're not all the sponsor of terror as though Iran
    has anything to do with anti-American terrorists I don't know who is the they
    that we're talking about but I believe American citizens care about America first
    they may discuss other nations and the interests in the Middle East or in in Europe
    and and those interests might align with their own worldview whatever but when
    it comes at the end of the day if everybody starts to war with everybody else
    their America first like I I'm America first if there's a war that breaks out
    and we have to pick up guns I'm fighting for America I'll take them on a case
    by case basis case I know immigrants I know immigrants who are absolutely super
    patriots who know American history and love and care about America more than their
    next door neighbors we're from here yeah but having universal okay sure let's
    talk about case by case then that's fine well I think I think I think he's I think
    clearly accusing me a worse war with Iran he was he's entertained the possibility
    of putting ground troops in there don't take personal tasks just don't take this
    country either of you you've taken personal shots let's not do it yeah you guys
    are just having fun and I'm having fun just on the idea here let me or spot he
    said that there's a there's a red on the there's a threat from Iran to remissile
    to America's bases in the Middle East yeah because of Israel and because of this
    war the first time Iran ever fired missiles at an American base over there was
    in response never wrong bombing them it's never wrong is that what everybody thinks
    never is ball is wrong you score this let's bring it back got a joke Scott Scott
    it's a remarkable to me and I want to reiterate and then Iran shot missiles at
    Qatar and Iraq Scott you're a patriotic American God bless you God bless the United
    States thank you for allowing me to come to this country and become an American
    it's a great country and as a patriotic American I assume that the the United
    States government and the United States intelligence community in the United States
    military okay has America's best interest at heart however we have learned from
    the history and Scott's done a very good job of detailing this during the Iraq
    war that the United States gets it wrong okay I don't think the United States
    lied us into war but the United States got it wrong so I think Scott's right we
    must make sure that we learn the lessons of Iraq but not over learn the lessons
    of Iraq I would also say this there are many lobby organizations in the United
    States there's the China lobby there's the oil lobby there's the the pharmaceutical
    lobby there's the Qatar lobby I live in Washington I see all these lobby organizations
    okay the fact of the matter is the pro-Israel lobby which actually lobbies in
    support of the US-Israel relationship is comprised of tens of millions of Christians
    and Jews and Hindus and yes yes Muslims who believe strongly in a strong US Israel
    relationships the reason that relationship has been so strong over so many years
    and that this quote lobby has been so successful is they're pushing through an
    open door with policymakers not because some nefarious money influence but because
    of the end of the day the interests align we we counterterrorism together we counter
    nuclear proliferation together and we believe that the US Israel relationship
    is a strong relationship and and these accusations of dual loyalty and these accusations
    of Israel firsters that Scott's thrown around I think distract us from the conversation
    which I think we should return to all right let's talk about today we've talked
    about best case scenarios we talked about worst case scenarios and we talked about
    really worst case scenarios so I think let's let's talk about the way forward
    and I'd be interested in hearing from Scott where he thinks we're going and I'm
    certainly I don't crystal ball these things it's always difficult to predict but
    I I think President Trump has done a really good job I think he has led this right
    he has not been you know the at the back-end call of BB Netanyahu or Mohammed
    bin Salman of Saudi Arabia or anyone else he has led this effort he has made these
    decisions this is a man who threat is entire career and not just his political
    rear but many many years before that believe that an Iranian nuclear weapon was
    a threat to the United States of America not just to our allies but to the United
    States of America he's been very clear on record he led this campaign since he
    started in January he offered negotiations he got rebuffed by the Iranians in
    Oman he put pressure on the regime economically he continued to offer negotiations
    he offered a very good something that I thought was flawed I mean I got to tell
    you the the offer in Oman that he gave to the Iranians I thought it was flawed
    because I think it allowed Iran to retain this key enrichment capability the Iranians
    turned it down and I think Hamane to his everlasting regret is going to wonder
    why did I turn that down I could have got the enrichment capability that Scott
    thinks they deserve and yet I rejected it why did I reject it because now look
    what's happened in the past 12 days you know I've lost for dough mostly we'll
    see what happens on the BDA the battle damage assessment I've certainly lost the
    tons I've lost my conversion facility at Isfahan which converts uranium hexafluoride
    into into well converts yellow cake into uranium hexafluoride to pump into centrifuges
    and the most important thing I lost at Isfahan there's a conversion facility that
    takes 90% enriched uranium and turns it into uranium metal without uranium metal
    they don't have any 90% enriched uranium he just means hypothetically if they
    did have some you know this be clear you know the 60% that's 99% of the weight
    and 90% enriched uranium by the way you can make a crude nuclear device with 60%
    enriched uranium I just want to put that on the record but he lost that key conversion
    facility that turns 90% enriched uranium or even 60% enriched uranium into uranium
    metal you need uranium metal to fashion a crude nuclear device or a warhead that's
    been destroyed and I just when I was coming in this morning I just checked I thought
    it was interesting I'm in a whole lot of discussion about the fact that about
    12 or 16 trucks showed up at Fordot in the days before the the US strikes and
    moved something out of Fordot well according to reports just this morning we'll
    see if they're verified I don't trust single sourcing I don't trust what some
    reporter just says in their stories because reporters got it wrong over and over
    again especially all the ones who accused present Trump of interrussian agent
    but we'll see what happens we'll see if it's verified but according to the reports
    most of the material remained at Fordot because the Iranians were calculating
    this was the most heavily fortified facility they were also calculating the present
    Trump was not going to strike it because what they had been doing was listening
    to lots of voices and we can name the voices or we can just talk talk to them
    about a collective who were who they thought were telling Trump don't do it and
    we're telling Trump don't do it and Trump decided on his own to do it so they
    kept the enriched material at Fordot and if that's the case it may be that much
    of it was destroyed again caveat it's just one or two stories right now one in
    NBC news and let's see what happens over the coming days but if that's the case
    that material may have been destroyed one other element that we haven't even talked
    about at all today which I think your listeners should be aware of we talked a
    lot about nuclear weapons development warhead development what the Israelis did
    was they took out the top 15 nuclear weapons scientists who have been part of
    remember I talked about that original and mod program and the development of those
    five atomic weapons well some of them who are old enough come from the mod program
    which is the early 2000s some of them are new but they've been or not new but
    younger and they've been trained by the veterans the 15 top guys taken out that
    is a kin to its January of feb
  text: we should not kill the aia tolla but Benjamin Netanyahu says we should he
    said just the other day that if we get rid of the aia tolla that will solve all
    the problems which is just crazy to think that they have Israeli officials have
    been tweeting out pictures and piling around with the son of the shaw talking
    about reinstalling his royal majesty's monarchy sock puppet dictator ship that's
    taking back iran for the people of iran giving them over to a bunch of foreign
    backed exiles try was that what trump meant when he gave that speech and cutters
    saying we don't believe in neo conservatism and spreading democracy anymore he's
    just setting up because we're going to try to reinstall a monarch can you go into
    the analysis of best case and worst case you laid out the best case what so worst
    case would be the worst case is this that i hear that what was the worst case
    i i miss the best case is a deal yeah that we quit now the deal that basically
    you guys agree on the on the best yeah i mean we respect their right to a civilian
    nuclear program and tried to negotiate as i said back into something like the
    jcpo which again had them exporting their entire style no so uranium out of the
    country he wants no nuclear program what so no that's not what i said there's
    no i said we'd be careful what i said well no enrichment capability i said right
    to retire dependence on other countries to supply their fuel and you can you teach
    me the difference yeah so let me just step back from this because we agree on
    some and we disagree on a major issue and that if we both agree iran deserves
    a civilian nuclear program i told is never going to give in on enrichment can
    i just we know that okay so premise for our whole discussion here okay therefore
    what he's saying is we're going to have to keep escalating the war until the mission
    is accomplished i said that Scott i think it's again important the the distinction
    here right we both agree that iran deserves a civilian nuclear program 23 countries
    have civilian nuclear programs and they don't have enrichment and they don't have
    reprocessing where we differ is i don't think iran should have the iran standard
    i think that should iran should agree to the gold standard the 23 us allies have
    agreed to so have civilian nuclear program but you don't get to keep the key enrichment
    and reprocessing capabilities that you need to develop nuclear weapons do you
    think that bill Clinton should have just let the Chinese sell them the light water
    reactor that they wanted to back in the 90s yeah an america of course allowed
    russia to sell them a heavy water reactor for the same purpose but i agree with
    Scott that i think one of the ways are out of this is yes whether it's the Chinese
    or preferably as an american i prefer the americans actually sell reactors to
    the iranians is great in a nuclear industry in this country let's do that but
    if they can't the south korean's can the russians can the chinese can i wouldn't
    want to have significant russian and chinese influence in iran so better that
    it be a western country that does it nevertheless provide those reactors in their
    proliferation proof there's no enrichment and no reprocessing you buy your fuel
    rods from abroad you put them in the reactors you power the iranian electrical
    grid which is in terrible shape because the i told the has spent a half a trillion
    dollars trying to build nuclear weapons and not trying to provide electricity
    for his people let's help him let's help his people get electricity but the key
    difference in our argument and it's a fundamental difference got's right like
    the key difference is i do not want to give this regime enrichment or reprocessing
    because they have shown over time for whatever reason whether you believe it's
    they intended to where we were lying about it or we broke them it doesn't matter
    what they have shown over the past number of years is they have gone up from three
    point six seven percent in rich iranian for civilian purpose all the way up to
    sixty percent which is ninety nine percent of what you need for weapons great
    since we've seen them do it before we don't want to see them do it again so no
    enrichment full this mantle meant full deal and then there's a peaceful resolution

    tons I've lost my conversion facility at Isfahan which converts uranium hexafluoride
    into into well converts yellow cake into uranium hexafluoride to pump into centrifuges
    and the most important thing I lost at Isfahan there's a conversion facility that
    takes 90% enriched uranium and turns it into uranium metal without uranium metal
    they don't have any 90% enriched uranium he just means hypothetically if they
    did have some you know this be clear you know the 60% that's 99% of the weight
    and 90% enriched uranium by the way you can make a crude nuclear device with 60%
    enriched uranium I just want to put that on the record but he lost that key conversion
    facility that turns 90% enriched uranium or even 60% enriched uranium into uranium
    metal you need uranium metal to fashion a crude nuclear device or a warhead that's
    been destroyed and I just when I was coming in this morning I just checked I thought
    it was interesting I'm in a whole lot of discussion about the fact that about
    12 or 16 trucks showed up at Fordot in the days before the the US strikes and
    moved something out of Fordot well according to reports just this morning we'll
    see if they're verified I don't trust single sourcing I don't trust what some
    reporter just says in their stories because reporters got it wrong over and over
    again especially all the ones who accused present Trump of interrussian agent
    but we'll see what happens we'll see if it's verified but according to the reports
    most of the material remained at Fordot because the Iranians were calculating
    this was the most heavily fortified facility they were also calculating the present
    Trump was not going to strike it because what they had been doing was listening
    to lots of voices and we can name the voices or we can just talk talk to them
    about a collective who were who they thought were telling Trump don't do it and
    we're telling Trump don't do it and Trump decided on his own to do it so they
    kept the enriched material at Fordot and if that's the case it may be that much
    of it was destroyed again caveat it's just one or two stories right now one in
    NBC news and let's see what happens over the coming days but if that's the case
    that material may have been destroyed one other element that we haven't even talked
    about at all today which I think your listeners should be aware of we talked a
    lot about nuclear weapons development warhead development what the Israelis did
    was they took out the top 15 nuclear weapons scientists who have been part of
    remember I talked about that original and mod program and the development of those
    five atomic weapons well some of them who are old enough come from the mod program
    which is the early 2000s some of them are new but they've been or not new but
    younger and they've been trained by the veterans the 15 top guys taken out that
    is a kin to its January of feb.
  type: recommendation
- actionable: true
  confidence: medium
  extracted: be consistent we should be consistent not just with american allies but
    also very clear with american enemies i think that's the third important thing
    we do fourth is i think it's really important that we find some kind of accommodation
    between the israelis and the Palestinians we can go down many rabbit holes on
    that but i think that lays the predicate for a southe israeli normalization deal
    that then brings in multiple era countries and Muslim countries and finally is
    we talked about the abraham Accords i i think we need to start thinking about
    what do the sirus Accords look like right sirus was the great Persian king right
    who by the way brought the you know the Jews back from from the diaspora to jirusselam
    and sirus Accords would be let's find an agreement between the united states and
    israel and a ron that would be a remarkable transformation in the region if we
    could actually do that so imagine a middle east and again i know the sounds fanciful
    but i think this is what trump has in mind when he starts to talk about the things
    you're seeing in his truth posts is actually a middle east that can be fundamentally
    transformed where we actually do bring peace between israel a ron Saudi Arabia
    and the rest of these countries i by the way completely agree with you on Syria
    the idea that we are trusting a former al-Qaeda ISIS jihadist to rule Syria i
    think is a big bet president trump has made he's made it on the advice of mbs
    we'll see how that transforms or transpires and see if Syria is transformed but
    the notion that somehow we should just be rolling the dice lifting all the sanctions
    and taking this former al-Qaeda jihadist at his word is a big bet if we get the
    bet right that is actually a remarkable occurrence because now of a sudden in
    Syria and Lebanon are brought into this Abraham Accords sirus Accords structure
    and then we actually have what i think the all three of us want is peace in the
    middle east stability in the middle east i don't think we need democracy in the
    middle east i think if the middle east look like the ua that'd be a pretty good
    middle east i think we'd all be pretty comfortable without if that kind of stability
    and prosperity and ultimately you could put these countries on a pathway to greater
    democracy the way that we did during the cold war where countries like Taiwan
    and South Korea that were military dictatorships end up becoming pro-western democracy
    so that's kind of stepping back maybe a little bit partly hannish but i think
    we should also always keep in mind what a potential vision for peace could look
    like so scott as many people know here in austin texas you are the director of
    the libertarian institute let's zoom out a bit what are the key pillars of libertarianism

    is the non-aggression principle but which essentially is the same thing as our
    our social rules for dealing with each other in private life no force no theft
    no fraud and keep your hands to yourself and we apply that same moral law to government
    and so you know some libertarians are anarcho-capitalists summer so-called minarchists
    meaning we want the absolute minimum amount of government a night watchman type
    state in in other words just enough to enforce contracts and protect property
    rights and allow freedom in a free market to work there's also of course natural
    rights theory Austrian school economics and a lot of revisionist history and and
    it is something very key to libertarian theory was expressed by mary n Rothbard
    was that war is the key to the whole libertarian business because especially in
    the united states of america as long as we maintain a world empire makes it impossible
    for us to have a limited and decentralized government here at home as our constitution
    describes and so i was going to crack a joke but neither of you have called me
    an isolationist yet but i was going to joke yes as as Thomas Jefferson wrote in
    the declaration of isolation the same guy a principal author of the declaration
    of isolation he said in his first inaugural address we seek peace commerce and

  type: recommendation
- actionable: true
  confidence: medium
  extracted: also just say one more thing not to be agist but most of the major leaders
    with nukes and those with power in the world are in their seventies and eighties
    i don't know if that contributes to it but they kind of a ground in a different
    time that may i have a hope for the fresher younger leaders have to have a more
    optimistic view towards peace and to be able to reach towards peace and yeah underlying
    so much of what we're talking about here is all this enmity right but america
    could just work remember when china cut that pseudo sort of peace deal between
    Saudi and iran a couple years ago or last year was it we could try to double up
    on that we should we could try to come up with ways for Saudi and Iran to exchange
    as much as possible you know i know you don't like all the going back too far
    in history but it's important it's in my book that in nineteen ninety three is
    a big number zinski who the revolution had happened on his watch operation equal
    claw the disaster of the rescue mission in seventy nine after the hostage crisis
    in everything all that egg was on z b space but in ninety three he said we should
    normalize relations we should build an oil pipeline across iran so they can make
    money we can make money and we can start to normalize and Ronald Reagan's secretary
    of state Alexander Hague who had been Kissinger's right hand man agreed they both
    were trying to push that but the Clinton administration went ahead with martin
    indick who had been yet sock shameers man and inaugurated the dual containment
    policy instead because these railings were concerned that america had just beaten
    up on a rock so bad in iraq war one that now a rock wasn't powerful enough to
    balance against iran so america had to stay in Saudi to balance against them both
    and that was the origin of the dual containment policy was martin indick who had
    been yet sock shameers man who pushed it on clinton and this was not the israelis
    it was the coities who lied that there was a truck bomb attempt assassination
    against hw bush which was a total hoax it was debunked by seymour herch by the
    end of the year it was just a whiskey smuggling ring and it was the same guy whose
    daughter had claimed to have seen the iraqy soldiers throw the babies out of the
    incubators he was the guy who two years later made up this hoax about sedom who's
    saying trying to murder bush senior but when he did that was when bill clinton
    finally gave in and adopted the dual containment policy because he had been interested
    in potentially reaching out to sedom and the iatola both at that time but instead
    of having normalization with both we had to have permanent cold war through the
    end of the century with both and my argument is simply it just didn't have to
    be that way is the same thing with russia look at you know how determined the
    democrats especially are to have this conflict with russia where to donald trump
    nah not at all we could get along with them and so it's perfectly within reason
    if the big nebrzinski says we can talk with iran and get along with iran and donald
    trump says we can get along with russia then the same thing for north korea the
    same thing for china and then and then who do we have left to fight just bala
    has bala's nothing without iran but just that's got knife fighting that's that'll
    be the last remain that's the fun kind of fight that'll be fine fine peaceful
    you're the CEO of at dd the foundation for defense of democracies it's a dc based
    organization that focuses on national security and foreign policy what has been
    your approach to solving some of these problems of the world so look i love the
    vision that scott painted and i agree with some of the libertarian instincts that
    he has but my view is that america is the indispensable power scott mentioned
    earlier in the conversation about the rules based order that is so important on
    the npt and all these rules based agreements that are important to maintain well
    the rule rules based order has been maintained by the united states since world
    were two right there is no american prosperity to the degree that we have there's
    no recovery of europe there's no recovery of aja after the devastation of world
    were two without american power and the rules based order that america has led
    and backstopped and i think america first is about american power and deterrence
    i think if you want to avoid war i think you cannot just believe in some fantasy
    where all the world's leaders are going to get together in some place and are
    just going to agree to disarm all their nuclear weapons and we'll disarm our entire
    military and we'll have one submarine off our coast and some of all of that is
    going to lead to peace i mean i think what is led to peace in the past has been
    the american for deterrence of our military and i believe that our enemies think
    we will credibly use it i think if they believe will credibly use it then it's
    less likely they will challenge us and if they less likely to challenge us and
    challenge our allies is less likely to be war so for me deterrence leads to peace
    and any kind of unilateral disarmament any kind of i think sort of fancival notion
    that somehow their our enemies are going to respect the non-aggression principle
    that is the core fundamental underpinnings of libertarianism which i think in
    in a personal relationship i think is very important but remember these are aggressors
    they don't respect the non-aggression principle i think we can spend a lot of
    time we did over how many hours now has been talking about the fact that in scots
    view of the world it's america that provokes it's america that provokes and then
    it's not america provoking it's Israel provoking and oh by the way america provokes
    because we're being seduced or paid or brow beaten by those those Israelis and
    you know those Jews in america i mean i think that whole notion at some point
    we are we are the provocative force in global politics i think is is wrong i think
    the fact of the matter is we make mistakes we are an imperfect nation we have
    made some serious sometimes catastrophic mistakes but the there is a bad world
    out there there are evil men who want to do us harm and we have to prevent away
    prevent them from doing us harm and to do that we need an american military that
    is serious and well supported we don't need a military industrial complex that
    ultimately is going to pull us into wars we need thoughtful leaders like president
    trump who will resist that and we'll say at the end of the day i will use force
    when it is selective narrow overwhelming and deadly and that was trump's operation
    just a few days ago he he went after three key facilities that were being used
    to develop the capability for nuclear nuclear weapons are the greatest danger
    to humanity i totally agree with scott like i think a world without nuclear weapons
    the kind of world that that Reagan envisioned and others have envisioned since
    is really the only way we can eliminate the most devastating weapons that can
    end humankind but we have to make sure that those weapons don't end up in the
    hands of regimes that seek to do us harm and they have have done us harm over
    over many many decades so yeah i mean deterrence peace through strength rules
    based order the foundation for defense of democracies is not the foundation for
    promotion of democracy we don't believe in this important concept that we have
    to promote democracy around the world i'll speak for myself because we have many
    people at my think tank 105 people we have different views i don't personally
    believe that it is the world in the United States to bring democracy to the middle
    east or democracy around the world i think to the extent we tried we failed i'm
    not sure the middle east is ready for democracy now a ron is interesting because
    it's not an Arab country right it is it is a different country altogether culturally
    it's a very sophisticated country it has a long history it actually has a history
    where it has had democracy in the past it is a country that i think could incredible
    potential under the right leadership and under the right circumstances i don't
    know if the right circumstances are a constitutional monarchy with reza pala v
    as the as the as the crown prince or the Shah i don't know whether it's a secular
    democracy or not let let let iranians make that decision if i've been pronouncing
    it wrong this whole time reza pala v you know the guy got met him yeah yeah pala
    v pala what were you saying i thought it was pala v oh wow yeah no it's okay it's
    okay you know you know you've never gotten wrong in pronouncing a problem no problem
    that's not that that's not pronouncing so many things correctly i think people
    will give you can i ask you though like i mean all this militarization is led
    to a state of permanent war we've been bombing a rack for 34 years we launched
    we put a war against the Taliban who didn't attack us instead of al-Qaeda who
    did fought for 20 years in the Taliban one anyway we overthrew a launching aggressive
    war against sadam who's saying put the it's holos best friends in power launching
    aggressive war against libya on this ridiculous hoax that cadapu is about to murder
    every last man woman and child in Benghazi imagine charlotte north carolina being
    wiped off the map barakobama lied in order to start that war and completely destroyed
    libya it's now three pieces in a state of semi-permanent civil war including and
    this wasn't just back then this is to this day the re legalization a re-institutionalization
    of chattel slavery of sub-seher and black Africans in libya to this day as a result
    the art intervention this was not a direct overt war but america israel soudi
    cutter and turkey all back to bin lawd knights in syria completely destroyed syria
    to the point where the caliphate grew up and then we had launched a rack war three
    to destroy the caliphate again and so i'm not seeing the peace through strength
    i'm seeing permanent militarism and permanent war through strength point well
    made he's speaking to the the double edged sword of a strong military that what
    you mentioned that trump did seems like a very difficult thing to do which is
    keep it hit hard and keep it short we don't know how this ended yet but even the
    beginning part is not trivial to do like just hitting one mission and focalizing
    except for one post no regime change like really pushing peace make a deal cease
    fire like that's that's an uncommon way to operate so i guess you said that we
    should resist the military industrial complex that's not easy to do that that
    that's the double edged sword of a strong military let me say real quick and i
    promise i'll show up can i almost say one thing and i'll stop you made me point
    then i just i just want to add it's a really important point okay is grass roots
    effort there is no who the lobby in america okay it was grass roof efforts by
    libertarians quakers and leftists to get war powers resolutions introduced in
    trump's first term to stop the war in Yemen which was launched not for israel
    for Saudi Arabia and ua e by barakobama in 2015 that's not a first afghan war
    one about israel either okay but this Yemen war was i thought 9-11 was about israel
    well it was in great part but the afk the decision to sack Kabul and do a regime
    change and all that had nothing to do with the liqueur whatsoever other than well
    we got to keep the war going long enough to go to bagdad okay so was Israel fault
    i was in the middle of saying about the war in Yemen that we got the war powers
    resolution through twice and trump vetoed it twice and his man peat nivaro explained
    to the new york times that this was just welfare for american industry a lot of
    industrialists were angry about the terrorists disrupting trade with china and
    somehow they substituted rathion for all american industry somehow and said industry
    will be happy if we funnel a lot of money to rathion that's peat nivaro talking
    to the new york times about why they continued the war in Yemen throughout trumps
    entire first term he had no interest in it all the whole thing was it was obama's
    fall the whole thing was essentially on autopilot and what was he doing is flying
    us al-qaeda's air force against the hoothies who originally if you go back to
    january of 2015 america was passing intelligence to the hoothies to use to kill
    al-qaeda you know a qa p the guys that tried to blow up the plane over Detroit
    with the underpants bomb on christmas day 2009 that did all those horrific masqueras
    in europe real aspen lawdnight terrorists the hoothies were our allies against
    them before barak obama stabbed them in the back and why did trump keep that going
    when he inherited that horrific war from barak obama why do you do it according
    to his trade guy so that they could keep funneling american taxed and inflated
    dollars into the pocket books of stockholders of rathion incorporated right military
    industrial complex the point was made yeah maybe i could respond to that because
    i mean again it's always america's fault this is the corner sky is sick and jab
    but you know i know but it's downy and ua asked barak obama for permission to
    start that war and for american help in prosecuting it and he said yes and in
    help i'm gonna sagway into an answer because i i think it deserves an answer a
    military industrial complex is a serious concern um because i think you're right
    it there you know the bigger and gets um and the more weapons you have you think
    the more the greater the temptation to use it right i think that's sort of the
    the argument and then there's also self enrichment and how much money can be made
    and in all of that i think is of serious concern to people look i think trump
    is somebody who it's hard press to say that donald trump um is a great advocate
    of the military industrial complex or that he is he is in their pocket the same
    way that he's in the pocket of these railies and in the pocket of the Saudis and
    in the pocket of everybody i mean i think the one thing with trump is that trump
    has he has learned the lessons of american engagement over the past few decades
    and i think scott's done a good job of kind of laying out the mistakes have been
    made even though you know we can discuss about causal connections and who's responsible
    and you know i i lean on and we i want to well scott can i finish because you
    know your your causal connection is always it's america aggressing israel aggressing
    and all these poor people responding to us um but nonetheless i think trump has
    he's learned the lessons but he hasn't overlaid the lessons he he's not paralyzed
    by a rack or if gana stan or the mistakes made by his predecessors he understands
    that at the end of the day we need serious american power we need lethal power
    we need four deterrence and he's been very careful and very selective about how
    he uses american power i mean we've talked about it throughout this call conversation
    trump used american power to kill custom solomani the world's most dangerous terrorists
    he killed bug daddy the head of isis one of the world's most dangerous terrorists
    he he refrained from going after the iranian take down of our drone he refrained
    from when the iranians fired on soudi aramco and took off 20% of our oil right
    he's been very very selective about the use of american power he did go after
    the houthis who are a ron backed and we're using iranian missiles to go after
    our ship that's not true those are north korean missiles completely debunked by
    jane's defense quickly nice try nice try anyway everybody knows that the iranians
    have been financing the houthis his ball has been training the houthis and iran
    has given capabilities to the houthis to develop their own indigenous missile
    capability the fact of matter is he he did in a way go after the houthis much
    more intensively than Biden did in order to prevent them from continuing to shut
    down red she shipping on which both america and our allies depend as a trade route
    he actually did quite successfully because after a few days of pretty intensive
    bombing the houthis got the message and they cut a deal with donna trump they're
    not going to interfere with our ship anymore he got to deal with them they kept
    bomb in israel which is what got him involved in the first place he completely
    backed out sounds to me like they won and he backed down well it sounds it sounds
    like he in terms of promoting american in national security interests sounds like
    he did he did a pretty good job of sending a message to the houthis and the iranians
    don't worry best with the united states and that gets us to the contemporary reality
    he took a decision one day on one day to send our beetos and our subs in order
    to to severe damage to three nuclear facilities was a one day campaign was selective
    it was narrow it was overwhelming and i think it sends a message to hamine i think
    it sends a message to regimes around the world anti-american regimes around the
    world that donna trump has not over learned the lessons of the past 20 years right
    but that in fact he is not going to dismantle the u
  text: we should also just say one more thing not to be agist but most of the major
    leaders with nukes and those with power in the world are in their seventies and
    eighties i don't know if that contributes to it but they kind of a ground in a
    different time that may i have a hope for the fresher younger leaders have to

    enough to balance against iran so america had to stay in Saudi to balance against
    them both and that was the origin of the dual containment policy was martin indick
    who had been yet sock shameers man who pushed it on clinton and this was not the
    israelis it was the coities who lied that there was a truck bomb attempt assassination
    against hw bush which was a total hoax it was debunked by seymour herch by the
    end of the year it was just a whiskey smuggling ring and it was the same guy whose
    daughter had claimed to have seen the iraqy soldiers throw the babies out of the
    incubators he was the guy who two years later made up this hoax about sedom who's
    saying trying to murder bush senior but when he did that was when bill clinton
    finally gave in and adopted the dual containment policy because he had been interested
    in potentially reaching out to sedom and the iatola both at that time but instead
    of having normalization with both we had to have permanent cold war through the
    end of the century with both and my argument is simply it just didn't have to
    be that way is the same thing with russia look at you know how determined the
    democrats especially are to have this conflict with russia where to donald trump
    nah not at all we could get along with them and so it's perfectly within reason
    if the big nebrzinski says we can talk with iran and get along with iran and donald
    trump says we can get along with russia then the same thing for north korea the
    same thing for china and then and then who do we have left to fight just bala
    has bala's nothing without iran but just that's got knife fighting that's that'll
    be the last remain that's the fun kind of fight that'll be fine fine peaceful
    you're the CEO of at dd the foundation for defense of democracies it's a dc based
    organization that focuses on national security and foreign policy what has been
    your approach to solving some of these problems of the world so look i love the
    vision that scott painted and i agree with some of the libertarian instincts that
    he has but my view is that america is the indispensable power scott mentioned
    earlier in the conversation about the rules based order that is so important on
    the npt and all these rules based agreements that are important to maintain well
    the rule rules based order has been maintained by the united states since world
    were two right there is no american prosperity to the degree that we have there's
    no recovery of europe there's no recovery of aja after the devastation of world
    were two without american power and the rules based order that america has led
    and backstopped and i think america first is about american power and deterrence
    i think if you want to avoid war i think you cannot just believe in some fantasy
    where all the world's leaders are going to get together in some place and are
    just going to agree to disarm all their nuclear weapons and we'll disarm our entire
    military and we'll have one submarine off our coast and some of all of that is
    going to lead to peace i mean i think what is led to peace in the past has been
    the american for deterrence of our military and i believe that our enemies think
    we will credibly use it i think if they believe will credibly use it then it's
    less likely they will challenge us and if they less likely to challenge us and
    challenge our allies is less likely to be war so for me deterrence leads to peace
    and any kind of unilateral disarmament any kind of i think sort of fancival notion
    that somehow their our enemies are going to respect the non-aggression principle
    that is the core fundamental underpinnings of libertarianism which i think in
    in a personal relationship i think is very important but remember these are aggressors
    they don't respect the non-aggression principle i think we can spend a lot of
    time we did over how many hours now has been talking about the fact that in scots
    view of the world it's america that provokes it's america that provokes and then
    it's not america provoking it's Israel provoking and oh by the way america provokes
    because we're being seduced or paid or brow beaten by those those Israelis and
    you know those Jews in america i mean i think that whole notion at some point
    we are we are the provocative force in global politics i think is is wrong i think
    the fact of the matter is we make mistakes we are an imperfect nation we have
    made some serious sometimes catastrophic mistakes but the there is a bad world
    out there there are evil men who want to do us harm and we have to prevent away
    prevent them from doing us harm and to do that we need an american military that
    is serious and well supported we don't need a military industrial complex that
    ultimately is going to pull us into wars we need thoughtful leaders like president
    trump who will resist that and we'll say at the end of the day i will use force
    when it is selective narrow overwhelming and deadly and that was trump's operation
    just a few days ago he he went after three key facilities that were being used
    to develop the capability for nuclear nuclear weapons are the greatest danger
    to humanity i totally agree with scott like i think a world without nuclear weapons
    the kind of world that that Reagan envisioned and others have envisioned since
    is really the only way we can eliminate the most devastating weapons that can
    end humankind but we have to make sure that those weapons don't end up in the
    hands of regimes that seek to do us harm and they have have done us harm over
    over many many decades so yeah i mean deterrence peace through strength rules
    based order the foundation for defense of democracies is not the foundation for
    promotion of democracy we don't believe in this important concept that we have
    to promote democracy around the world i'll speak for myself because we have many
    people at my think tank 105 people we have different views i don't personally
    believe that it is the world in the United States to bring democracy to the middle
    east or democracy around the world i think to the extent we tried we failed i'm
    not sure the middle east is ready for democracy now a ron is interesting because
    it's not an Arab country right it is it is a different country altogether culturally
    it's a very sophisticated country it has a long history it actually has a history
    where it has had democracy in the past it is a country that i think could incredible
    potential under the right leadership and under the right circumstances i don't
    know if the right circumstances are a constitutional monarchy with reza pala v
    as the as the as the crown prince or the Shah i don't know whether it's a secular
    democracy or not let let let iranians make that decision if i've been pronouncing
    it wrong this whole time reza pala v you know the guy got met him yeah yeah pala
    v pala what were you saying i thought it was pala v oh wow yeah no it's okay it's
    okay you know you know you've never gotten wrong in pronouncing a problem no problem
    that's not that that's not pronouncing so many things correctly i think people
    will give you can i ask you though like i mean all this militarization is led
    to a state of permanent war we've been bombing a rack for 34 years we launched
    we put a war against the Taliban who didn't attack us instead of al-Qaeda who
    did fought for 20 years in the Taliban one anyway we overthrew a launching aggressive
    war against sadam who's saying put the it's holos best friends in power launching
    aggressive war against libya on this ridiculous hoax that cadapu is about to murder
    every last man woman and child in Benghazi imagine charlotte north carolina being
    wiped off the map barakobama lied in order to start that war and completely destroyed
    libya it's now three pieces in a state of semi-permanent civil war including and
    this wasn't just back then this is to this day the re legalization a re-institutionalization
    of chattel slavery of sub-seher and black Africans in libya to this day as a result
    the art intervention this was not a direct overt war but america israel soudi
    cutter and turkey all back to bin lawd knights in syria completely destroyed syria
    to the point where the caliphate grew up and then we had launched a rack war three
    to destroy the caliphate again and so i'm not seeing the peace through strength
    i'm seeing permanent militarism and permanent war through strength point well
    made he's speaking to the the double edged sword of a strong military that what
    you mentioned that trump did seems like a very difficult thing to do which is
    keep it hit hard and keep it short we don't know how this ended yet but even the
    beginning part is not trivial to do like just hitting one mission and focalizing
    except for one post no regime change like really pushing peace make a deal cease
    fire like that's that's an uncommon way to operate so i guess you said that we
    should resist the military industrial complex that's not easy to do that that
    that's the double edged sword of a strong military let me say real quick and i
    promise i'll show up can i almost say one thing and i'll stop you made me point
    then i just i just want to add it's a really important point okay is grass roots
    effort there is no who the lobby in america okay it was grass roof efforts by
    libertarians quakers and leftists to get war powers resolutions introduced in
    trump's first term to stop the war in Yemen which was launched not for israel
    for Saudi Arabia and ua e by barakobama in 2015 that's not a first afghan war
    one about israel either okay but this Yemen war was i thought 9-11 was about israel
    well it was in great part but the afk the decision to sack Kabul and do a regime
    change and all that had nothing to do with the liqueur whatsoever other than well
    we got to keep the war going long enough to go to bagdad okay so was Israel fault
    i was in the middle of saying about the war in Yemen that we got the war powers
    resolution through twice and trump vetoed it twice and his man peat nivaro explained
    to the new york times that this was just welfare for american industry a lot of
    industrialists were angry about the terrorists disrupting trade with china and
    somehow they substituted rathion for all american industry somehow and said industry
    will be happy if we funnel a lot of money to rathion that's peat nivaro talking
    to the new york times about why they continued the war in Yemen throughout trumps
    entire first term he had no interest in it all the whole thing was it was obama's
    fall the whole thing was essentially on autopilot and what was he doing is flying
    us al-qaeda's air force against the hoothies who originally if you go back to
    january of 2015 america was passing intelligence to the hoothies to use to kill
    al-qaeda you know a qa p the guys that tried to blow up the plane over Detroit
    with the underpants bomb on christmas day 2009 that did all those horrific masqueras
    in europe real aspen lawdnight terrorists the hoothies were our allies against
    them before barak obama stabbed them in the back and why did trump keep that going
    when he inherited that horrific war from barak obama why do you do it according
    to his trade guy so that they could keep funneling american taxed and inflated
    dollars into the pocket books of stockholders of rathion incorporated right military
    industrial complex the point was made yeah maybe i could respond to that because
    i mean again it's always america's fault this is the corner sky is sick and jab
    but you know i know but it's downy and ua asked barak obama for permission to
    start that war and for american help in prosecuting it and he said yes and in
    help i'm gonna sagway into an answer because i i think it deserves an answer a
    military industrial complex is a serious concern um because i think you're right
    it there you know the bigger and gets um and the more weapons you have you think
    the more the greater the temptation to use it right i think that's sort of the
    the argument and then there's also self enrichment and how much money can be made
    and in all of that i think is of serious concern to people look i think trump
    is somebody who it's hard press to say that donald trump um is a great advocate
    of the military industrial complex or that he is he is in their pocket the same
    way that he's in the pocket of these railies and in the pocket of the Saudis and
    in the pocket of everybody i mean i think the one thing with trump is that trump
    has he has learned the lessons of american engagement over the past few decades
    and i think scott's done a good job of kind of laying out the mistakes have been
    made even though you know we can discuss about causal connections and who's responsible
    and you know i i lean on and we i want to well scott can i finish because you
    know your your causal connection is always it's america aggressing israel aggressing
    and all these poor people responding to us um but nonetheless i think trump has
    he's learned the lessons but he hasn't overlaid the lessons he he's not paralyzed
    by a rack or if gana stan or the mistakes made by his predecessors he understands
    that at the end of the day we need serious american power we need lethal power
    we need four deterrence and he's been very careful and very selective about how
    he uses american power i mean we've talked about it throughout this call conversation
    trump used american power to kill custom solomani the world's most dangerous terrorists
    he killed bug daddy the head of isis one of the world's most dangerous terrorists
    he he refrained from going after the iranian take down of our drone he refrained
    from when the iranians fired on soudi aramco and took off 20% of our oil right
    he's been very very selective about the use of american power he did go after
    the houthis who are a ron backed and we're using iranian missiles to go after
    our ship that's not true those are north korean missiles completely debunked by
    jane's defense quickly nice try nice try anyway everybody knows that the iranians
    have been financing the houthis his ball has been training the houthis and iran
    has given capabilities to the houthis to develop their own indigenous missile
    capability the fact of matter is he he did in a way go after the houthis much
    more intensively than Biden did in order to prevent them from continuing to shut
    down red she shipping on which both america and our allies depend as a trade route
    he actually did quite successfully because after a few days of pretty intensive
    bombing the houthis got the message and they cut a deal with donna trump they're
    not going to interfere with our ship anymore he got to deal with them they kept
    bomb in israel which is what got him involved in the first place he completely
    backed out sounds to me like they won and he backed down well it sounds it sounds
    like he in terms of promoting american in national security interests sounds like
    he did he did a pretty good job of sending a message to the houthis and the iranians
    don't worry best with the united states and that gets us to the contemporary reality
    he took a decision one day on one day to send our beetos and our subs in order
    to to severe damage to three nuclear facilities was a one day campaign was selective
    it was narrow it was overwhelming and i think it sends a message to hamine i think
    it sends a message to regimes around the world anti-american regimes around the
    world that donna trump has not over learned the lessons of the past 20 years right
    but that in fact he is not going to dismantle the u.

    i sanctioned yes yes ban sanctioned uh graduations thank you thank you well it's
    it causes some difficulties but anyway um i think the answer to that is that for
    putin he needs to understand that like khamenei he is two options here right option
    one which president trump has signaled over and over and over again is come sit
    down and negotiate a ceasefire with ukraineians okay i don't want to get into
    the details in the back and forth about who's responsible for the fact there's
    no ceasefire putin or zalanski i mean that's a whole other debate and i'm sure
    you guys have a lot of opinions on that um but path one is sit down and let's
    negotiate a ceasefire path two is the united states will use American power in
    order to build our leverage so that Vladimir putin understands that he has to
    do a ceasefire now i'm not suggesting us troops absolutely not all right what
    i am suggesting is there's a package right now with sanctions that have 88 co-sponsors
    in the senate across party lines and i think trump is using that and will use
    that as a sort of sort of damically hanging over putin in the russian economy
    to say look if Vladimir we either do a ceasefire or i'm gonna have no choice but
    to have to start imposing much more punishing sanctions on you and on the russian
    economy so i think there's an economic option i think there's a military option
    and i think the biggest mistake Biden made in this whole war and there's many
    mistakes uh in terms of signaling not having u

  text: the future of their ability to maintain their national sovereignty obviously
    getting their hands on an a bomb as quickly as possible is uh has been you know
    re incentivized to a great degree awesome really worried about the future of the
    non-plaferation treaty with the nuclear weapons states promise to respect the
    right of non-nuclear weapons states to civilian nuclear energy and where here
    you have a non-npt signatory nuclear weapons state israel launch an aggressive
    war against an npt signatory that is was not attacking them and was not making
    nuclear weapons and with the assistance of the world empire the united states
    another nuclear weapons state signatory to the npt and i don't really take this
    that seriously but it's worth at least listening to is uh mead vetev the uh once
    and probably future president of russia he said oh yeah well maybe we'll just
    give him a nuke or kind of imply maybe get Pakistan to now for people familiar
    with like he and peel mead vetev is sort of angry obama right for poop you know
    that skit where it's like obama talks all calm anger translate appeal goes off
    like a angry black guy kind of character right you can go nuts on twitter yeah
    vetev he he goes way out you know above and beyond but i think he's probably acting
    on instructions to talk that way and it is a real risk that the npt could just
    fall apart when it becomes when it's treated uh so callously by the united states
    who invented it and insisted that the rest of the world the dot that think to
    such a great degree trump did say don't use the n words he he talked down to mead
    vetev that's right yeah he did he did the and the new clear word yeah well and
    and i appreciate that and good and i was used right he's writing that is it's
    not and look the Pakistanis could give a new to Iran who are their friends i think
    not the tajas of allies i'm not saying i predict that but there's a danger of
    that um now when it comes to you know eastern asia obviously there's a concern
    about a chinese threat to tywan but nobody thinks china's coming for south korea
    or japan the the question of tywan is one that's very different because as the
    american president agreed with mousay tongue fifty years ago tywan is part of
    china and eventually will be reunited although we hope that's not by force since
    then they have essentially abandoned marxism although it's still a one-party authoritarian
    state but they've essentially abandoned marxism adopted markets at least to the
    degree that they've been able to afford to now build up a giant naval force that
    is capable of retaking tywan and so i think the way to prevent that is not from
    making a bunch of threats and setting examples in other places about how tough
    we are but to negotiate with the chinese and the tywanis and figure out a way
    to reunite the two in a peaceful way in order to prevent that war from breaking
    out because in fact we don't really have the naval and air capability to defend
    tywan we could lose a lot of guys trying and probably kill a lot of chinese trying
    but in the end they'd probably take tywan anyway we'd have lost a bunch of ships
    and and planes for nothing so we can negotiate an end to that and then even if
    america just withdrew from the region we could still negotiate long-term agreements
    between china, japan, south, korea and whoever there's no reason to think that
    everyone would make a mad scramble to a bomb to protect them if the moment they
    are out from under america's nuclear umbrella and so forth and the fact the matter
    is that you know the greatest threat to the status quo as far as the nuclear powers
    go probably is what just happened america and israel launching this war against
    a non-nuclear weapon state as a member in good standing of this treaty throws
    the the whole as they call it the liberal rules based world order into question
    i mean if these rules repeatedly always apply to everyone very often not to us
    then are they really the law or this is just the will of men in washington dc
    and how long do we expect the rest of the world to go ahead and abide by that
    if you know a deal is a deal until we decide as bill clinton said to wake up one
    morning and decide that we don't like it anymore and and change it that was a
    phrase from the founding act of 97 maybe we'll wake up one morning and decide
    that we don't want to do something else entirely is that your bill clinton press
    no i'll spare you okay i was pretty good after the show when we're not recording
    yeah i got i respond to a couple things here just really quickly i'll try to do
    it quickly um first of all you know the the notion that a rawn is in full compliance
    with the npt is just not the case the international atomic energy agency has made
    it clear in report after report after report that a rawn is in violation of its
    obligations under the um protocols of the ia ea under the request of the ia ea
    have made and under the npt so they are a serial violator of the npt unlike all
    these other countries we've been talking about that are allies second is this
    this quote rawn is not attacking israel that's quite amazing quote which kind
    of ignores i think uh fifty sixty years of uh Iranian attacks against israel including
    um suicide bombings and missiles and drones and uh October 7th and it's indisputable
    that a rawn has been attacking israel and they've been they've been doing it for
    many years through their teraproxies that they fund and finance and and weaponize
    and since uh October 7th they directly struck israel with hundreds of ballistic
    missiles in april and october of last year so this notion that before 12 days
    ago the rawnians were just playing nice with israelis and the israelis just came
    out of the blue well you said quote and quote rawn is not as not attacking israel
    so i mean it's just not true yeah they were not in a state of war until israel
    launched a state of war that's the fact yeah they were you know well they backed
    a group that did a thing yeah okay kill thousands of of israelis main thousands
    of israelis but that's what i bought ordered in tehran the Wall Street Journal
    says that us intelligence does not believe that tehran ordered that attack like
    they found out about what the wall street journal says and what us intelligence
    says and we can dispute whether they directed it on October 7th everybody knows
    indisputably that a rawn financed a mass provided fun Hamas it is weapons just
    well just a second provided Hamas with weapons that the irgc and the kud's force
    were training Hamas his balab backed by a rawn was training Hamas there were three
    meetings before October 7th one in bayrutes one in Damascus and one in tehran
    where the irgc has bala Hamas and palestin and islamic jihad were together there
    was a meeting in tehran that was attended by hamane the supreme leader now at
    those three meetings right before october 7th you know maybe they're discussed
    on the weather maybe they were discussing Persian poetry i don't know but it is
    hard to believe they weren't discussing something and the fact that they had armed
    Hamas financed Hamas and weaponized Hamas suggest to me that there is pretty overwhelming
    evidence that a rawn has been at war with israel for decades critics of israel
    will say that Benjamin Netanyahu has also been indirectly financing Hamas by allowing
    the fun to find going that america backs israel so anything israel doubts is america's
    responsibility to under that same logic right i think you started to make it a
    point disagreeing with scott about that they're not a good member of the npt that's
    all tiny technical violations none of that has anything to do with weaponization
    it's always oh yeah how do you explain this isotope and they go well it must have
    came with the Pakistani junk that we bought from a qicon and then later that's
    verified and they go yeah well we want to inspect this let us and they go no and
    then they do a year later and then they find nothing yeah that's just a case that's
    a tire history of iran of the ia ea's objections to iran so you listeners i know
    they're not going to do it because it's a lot of technical reading with weaponization
    but just go out go out and re-eation of nuclear ia ea reports dating back at least
    20 years and you'll see the ia meticulously methodically dispassionately outlining
    all of the violations that iran has embarked on of the npt virtually all those
    are resolved later they won't answer this and then later they do they won't answer
    that and then later they do and many open files are still there still there i
    mean just again like i just i just want your viewers to walk away from this conversation
    thing okay that's interesting i i didn't know that and then i'm going to go fact
    check mark and fact check scott and just kind of see what this is all about right
    because otherwise it's just he says she says or he says he says the fact of the
    matter is is that iran has been in violations of its obligations under the npt
    under the additional protocol it never never never ratified under its safeguards
    obligations under the npt it suggests a pattern of nuclear mandacity they abide
    by the additional protocol without having ratified it they abide by it for three
    years and did not proceed with any enrichment at all as long as they were dealing
    in good faith with the EU until w bush ruin those negotiations and close them
    down only then did they begin to install the centrifugia set nautants it's always
    they're playing screw things you can play and they didn't ratify the thing but
    they abided by it for years so that's an interesting violation of it but i think
    a more pragmatic and important disagreement that we already spoke to is how do
    we decrease the incentive for iran to build nuclear programs not just the next
    couple of years but in the next 10-20 years what that's you're mocking that there's
    a lot of people that will there's neocons that say basically invade everything
    let's make money off of war but there's people that will say that you know operation
    midnight hammer is actually a focused hard demonstration of strength of piece
    of strength that is an effective way to do do politics i mean there's cases to
    be made for all of it if we're really lucky yeah so it's a big risk is your case
    so here's some practical recommendations that i think the United States should
    follow i think the first is you know get the iran ins back to a man negotiate
    with them and do a deal again the deal has to be no enrichment full dismantlement
    i i think for the reasons we talked about today scott and i passionately disagreed
    but that's fine we this is this is a reasonable debate neither us is crazy neither
    us is rational it is what would it take to get a deal with iran i say i say this
    is the deal this has to be our red line scott disagree that's fine but we got
    to get a deal in that deal we got to provide them financial incentives right we're
    going to have to lift a certain number of sanctions because they're going to have
    to get something in return okay and we can argue about exactly how much but i
    think our opening negotiating position is no sanctions relief and then we'll get
    negotiated down from that right i mean like i think a lot of this is about how
    do you position yourself for a negotiation how do you how do you come in with
    leverage and then how do you find areas of compromise where you you satisfy your
    objectives one is oman two is the credible threat of military force needs to remain
    right hominay needs to understand that the United States of America and israel
    will use military force to stop them from developing nuclear weapons if he didn't
    believe that before 12 days ago he now believes that and i think that's the credibility
    of that military force has to be maintained in order to ensure that he does not
    break out or sneak out to a nuclear weapon i i think that's absolutely critical
    third is i think we have to reach agreements with all the other countries in the
    middle east to say hey listen we're demanding zero enrichment and full this man
    element from the iranians you don't get enrichment and you don't get a nuclear
    program that is capable of developing nuclear weapons our gold standard is the
    american standard civilian nuclear energy like 23 countries no enrichment in reprocess
    we should be consistent we should be consistent not just with american allies
    but also very clear with american enemies i think that's the third important thing
    we do fourth is i think it's really important that we find some kind of accommodation
    between the israelis and the Palestinians we can go down many rabbit holes on
    that but i think that lays the predicate for a southe israeli normalization deal
    that then brings in multiple era countries and Muslim countries and finally is
    we talked about the abraham Accords i i think we need to start thinking about
    what do the sirus Accords look like right sirus was the great Persian king right
    who by the way brought the you know the Jews back from from the diaspora to jirusselam
    and sirus Accords would be let's find an agreement between the united states and
    israel and a ron that would be a remarkable transformation in the region if we
    could actually do that so imagine a middle east and again i know the sounds fanciful
    but i think this is what trump has in mind when he starts to talk about the things
    you're seeing in his truth posts is actually a middle east that can be fundamentally
    transformed where we actually do bring peace between israel a ron Saudi Arabia
    and the rest of these countries i by the way completely agree with you on Syria
    the idea that we are trusting a former al-Qaeda ISIS jihadist to rule Syria i
    think is a big bet president trump has made he's made it on the advice of mbs
    we'll see how that transforms or transpires and see if Syria is transformed but
    the notion that somehow we should just be rolling the dice lifting all the sanctions
    and taking this former al-Qaeda jihadist at his word is a big bet if we get the
    bet right that is actually a remarkable occurrence because now of a sudden in
    Syria and Lebanon are brought into this Abraham Accords sirus Accords structure
    and then we actually have what i think the all three of us want is peace in the
    middle east stability in the middle east i don't think we need democracy in the
    middle east i think if the middle east look like the ua that'd be a pretty good
    middle east i think we'd all be pretty comfortable without if that kind of stability
    and prosperity and ultimately you could put these countries on a pathway to greater
    democracy the way that we did during the cold war where countries like Taiwan
    and South Korea that were military dictatorships end up becoming pro-western democracy
    so that's kind of stepping back maybe a little bit partly hannish but i think
    we should also always keep in mind what a potential vision for peace could look
    like so scott as many people know here in austin texas you are the director of
    the libertarian institute let's zoom out a bit what are the key pillars of libertarianism
    and how that informs how you see the world well the very basis of libertarianism
    is the non-aggression principle but which essentially is the same thing as our
    our social rules for dealing with each other in private life no force no theft
    no fraud and keep your hands to yourself and we apply that same moral law to government
    and so you know some libertarians are anarcho-capitalists summer so-called minarchists
    meaning we want the absolute minimum amount of government a night watchman type
    state in in other words just enough to enforce contracts and protect property
    rights and allow freedom in a free market to work there's also of course natural
    rights theory Austrian school economics and a lot of revisionist history and and
    it is something very key to libertarian theory was expressed by mary n Rothbard
    was that war is the key to the whole libertarian business because especially in
    the united states of america as long as we maintain a world empire makes it impossible
    for us to have a limited and decentralized government here at home as our constitution
    describes and so i was going to crack a joke but neither of you have called me
    an isolationist yet but i was going to joke yes as as Thomas Jefferson wrote in
    the declaration of isolation the same guy a principal author of the declaration
    of isolation he said in his first inaugural address we seek peace commerce and
    honest friendship with all nations and entangling alliances with none and that's
    the true libertarian philosophy think dr.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: #473 – Iran War Debate: Nuclear Weapons, Trump, Peace,
  Power & the Middle East


  This 251-minute episode features a robust debate between **Scott Horton** (antiwar.com,
  critic of US interventionism) and **Mark Dubowitz** (Foundation for Defense of Democracies,
  leading Iran expert) concerning the recent escalation of conflict involving Iran
  and Israel, focusing heavily on the nuclear issue and the role of the Trump administration.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **geopolitics and military strategy surrounding Iran''s
  nuclear program**, specifically analyzing the recent Israeli strikes, the subsequent
  US military action (B-2 strikes on Fordow), and the resulting tentative ceasefire.
  Secondary themes include the effectiveness of sanctions, the history of US-Iran
  diplomacy (JCPOA vs. Maximum Pressure), and the long-term implications for regional
  stability and the prospect of regime change.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Enrichment Thresholds and Intent:** The debate centered on the significance
  of Iran enriching uranium to 60%. Dubowitz argued this demonstrated intent toward
  weaponization, while Horton countered that 60% enrichment was a bargaining chip,
  noting Iran could have easily reached 90% purity (weapons-grade) if that were their
  sole goal, and that their primary goal was a latent deterrent, not immediate weaponization.

  *   **Reactor Types and Proliferation Pathways:** A technical distinction was made
  between the **Bushehr** reactor (a proliferation-proof Russian-supplied light water
  reactor used for electricity) and the **Arak** heavy water reactor. Horton claimed
  Arak was shut down by pouring concrete under the JCPOA to prevent it from producing
  weapons-grade plutonium, highlighting the specific technical safeguards negotiated
  in past deals.

  *   **Deeply Buried Facilities:** The discussion highlighted the extreme fortification
  of facilities like **Fordow**, buried 80 meters deep, suggesting a long-term, dedicated
  effort to maintain nuclear capability shielded from conventional attack.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  The discussion was largely geopolitical, offering few direct market insights, but
  implied several strategic angles:

  *   **Sanctions Impact:** Dubowitz emphasized that the "Maximum Pressure" campaign
  has severely hampered Iran''s economy, limiting its ability to fund its "axis of
  misery" (proxy forces).

  *   **Energy Security Risk:** The conflict underscores the persistent risk to Middle
  Eastern energy supplies, which historically drives volatility in global oil and
  gas markets.

  *   **Defense Spending:** Escalation in the region implies continued high demand
  for advanced defense technologies, particularly those capable of penetrating hardened
  targets (like the Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs mentioned).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Scott Horton & Mark Dubowitz:** The two central debaters, representing diametrically
  opposed views on US foreign policy regarding Iran.

  *   **Donald Trump:** Credited by Dubowitz for initiating the "Maximum Pressure"
  campaign and ordering the recent military strikes (B-2s on Fordow) to force Iran
  back to negotiations. Horton views Trump''s diplomatic efforts as a pretext for
  war.

  *   **Ayatollah Khamenei:** Central figure whose intentions regarding nuclear weapons
  development are the core of the disagreement.

  *   **Benjamin Netanyahu:** Mentioned as a proponent of aggressive preemptive action,
  including regime change.

  *   **IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency):** The body whose reports are cited
  by Dubowitz as evidence of Iran''s weapons program.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The episode heavily debated US foreign policy frameworks:

  *   **JCPOA (2015 Deal):** Horton views it as the best path to verifiable peace,
  while Dubowitz sees it as a failure that allowed Iran to retain key capabilities.

  *   **Maximum Pressure:** Dubowitz supports this strategy as necessary leverage
  against a terrorist regime, while Horton sees it as an escalatory path leading inevitably
  to war.

  *   **Red Lines:** The debate centered on whether "zero enrichment" or merely the
  acquisition of a weapon constitutes the non-negotiable US/Israeli red line.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a precarious future:

  *   **Escalation Risk:** Horton fears the recent strikes are the beginning of a
  slippery slope leading to full-scale regime change, chaos, and the empowerment of
  extremist elements (like in post-Iraq scenarios).

  *   **Nuclear Breakout:** Dubowitz believes the strikes were necessary to degrade
  capabilities, but the ultimate outcome depends on whether Iran accepts the current
  diplomatic off-ramp or decides that a nuclear deterrent is now essential, increasing
  the likelihood of a breakout attempt later.

  *   **Negotiation Stalemate:** The current ceasefire is viewed as highly tentative,
  dependent on Khamenei accepting a deal that involves significant nuclear concessions.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This podcast is most valuable for **Geopolitical Strategists, Foreign Policy Professionals,
  Defense Analysts, and individuals interested in international relations and conflict
  resolution**, particularly those tracking US-Middle East dynamics.'
