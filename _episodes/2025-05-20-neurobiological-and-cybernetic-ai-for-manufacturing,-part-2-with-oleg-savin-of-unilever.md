summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Neurobiological and Cybernetic AI for Manufacturing,
  Part 2 - with Oleg Savin of Unilever


  This episode, the second in a series, features Oleg Savin, Enterprise Architect
  and MES Expert at Unilever, discussing the critical distinction between neurobiological
  and cybernetic AI approaches and their implications for modern manufacturing. The
  core narrative focuses on bridging the gap between vast data collection and meaningful
  data utilization through advanced AI architectures.


  **1. Focus Area**: The discussion centers on the necessity of moving beyond current
  data collection practices toward **true Artificial Intelligence (AI)**—distinct
  from standard neural networks—to build the next generation of **Smart Operating
  Systems** in manufacturing. Key concepts include **ontological modeling**, **cybernetic
  vs. neurobiological AI**, and the convergence of **IT/OT**.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Data Underutilization**: Less than 10% of collected manufacturing data is
  meaningfully applied to generate knowledge or drive decisions, highlighting a critical
  need for intelligent filtering systems.

  *   **Ontological Modeling as the Foundation**: Future smart systems must be built
  on ontological models that allow AI to perceive, extract, and interpret high-value
  information fragments from massive data lakes, enabling the system to understand
  the manufacturing domain contextually.

  *   **True AI vs. Neural Networks**: Neural networks are useful but insufficient;
  true AI, as envisioned by Savin, must possess the capacity to acquire and formulate
  knowledge autonomously, moving beyond pattern recognition (like text generation
  in LLMs) to produce *essence* and maintain system stability.


  **3. Business/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Value of Ontology**: The specific ontology developed for a domain is becoming
  the most valuable asset, representing accumulated, stable knowledge that drives
  algorithmic functionality.

  *   **Eliminating Traditional Stages**: The proposed framework will allow frontline
  personnel (engineers, managers) to autonomously design and implement smart operating
  modules, eliminating traditional stages of requirement formulation, programming,
  and installation.

  *   **ROI through Stability**: The primary function of this advanced AI is achieving
  high process stability by predicting and eliminating deviations, potentially rendering
  traditional control, accounting, and management functions redundant, leading to
  significant efficiency gains.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Oleg Savin (Unilever)**: The expert guest, known for his insights on manufacturing
  conferences, driving the technical and philosophical arguments for advanced AI architectures.

  *   **Academician Gorskov**: Mentioned historically regarding early, unimplemented
  national economic management systems that lacked the necessary technological stack
  and mathematical models.


  **5. Future Implications**:

  *   **IT/OT Convergence**: Complete convergence will occur as production staff,
  equipped with ontological knowledge, can configure manufacturing models directly,
  even in the cloud.

  *   **Self-Organization**: Manufacturing will move toward self-organization and
  self-management via autonomous smart modules, enabling end-to-end management of
  the value creation process.

  *   **Shift in Personnel Value**: Future effectiveness will depend less on IT capability
  and more on personnel motivation and their ability to work with information, knowledge,
  and models, fostering creativity.


  **6. Target Audience**: **Manufacturing Executives, Enterprise Architects, Industrial
  IT/OT Leaders, and AI Strategists** focused on deep industrial transformation, particularly
  those looking to understand the theoretical underpinnings required for next-generation
  operational excellence beyond standard machine learning applications.


  ---

  **Comprehensive Summary:**


  Oleg Savin argues that the manufacturing sector is drowning in data (less than 10%
  utilized) because current systems lack the foundational intelligence required to
  interpret it contextually. The solution lies in developing Smart Operating Systems
  based on **true Artificial Intelligence**, which he explicitly separates from the
  current paradigm of neural networks. This true AI must leverage **ontological modeling**—a
  stable, domain-specific knowledge structure—to filter petabytes of data, extract
  relevant patterns, and maintain system stability by anticipating deviations.


  Savin emphasizes that achieving this requires a fundamental shift in understanding,
  necessitating that business leaders acquire knowledge across four domains: **philosophy
  (including phenomenology and epistemology), linguistics, neurobiology/cognitive
  psychology, and mathematics (including synergetics and fractal theory)**. He posits
  that the most advanced systems will utilize a **fractal cognitive computation model
  of consciousness**.


  The practical benefits of adopting this cybernetic/neurobiological hybrid approach
  are profound. First, it forces the **complete convergence of IT and OT**, allowing
  frontline staff to configure complex manufacturing models directly using established
  ontologies. Second, it enables **self-organization and self-management** through
  autonomous modules, leading to end-to-end value chain management. Third, the primary
  outcome is achieving a required level of **process stability** for a given time
  horizon, potentially making traditional reactive control functions obsolete.


  When advising executives on AI initiatives, Savin stresses that they must first
  clearly define the **holistic Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** that characterize
  the business state (e.g., stability, efficiency, value produced, interpreted through
  time). They must then demand explainability from their AI teams on how these high-level
  indicators are formulated and performed in real-time by the underlying models. The
  conversation underscores that while the theory is advanced, the practical implementation
  of these concepts is already underway, promising a revolution in industrial efficiency
  driven by deep, contextual understanding rather than mere data processing.'
