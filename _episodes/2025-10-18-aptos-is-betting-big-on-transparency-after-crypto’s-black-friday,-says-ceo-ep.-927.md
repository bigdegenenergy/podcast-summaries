  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Optos recently has really taken a focus point on how do we build what we call
    the global trading engine? Where assets move freely, where trades happen as seamlessly
    as on centralized exchanges, but with the transparency that only decentralized
    exchanges can bring.
  topic: technology/defi
- impact_reason: Identifies the massive, centralized revenue stream of crypto exchanges
    as the prime target market opportunity for decentralized infrastructure.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And seeing the way that crypto exchanges have gained $50 billion of revenue
    per year, growing very, very rapidly, yet all this is happening in centralized

    a meaningful value add for people to trade on decentralized infrastructure as

  topic: Web3 vision/adoption
- impact_reason: Identifies the intersection of decentralized storage and AI training
    data as a massive, immediate market opportunity, specifically noting cost savings
    (egress fees).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The first and obvious use case is AI. There's a tremendous amount of training
    data that we produce... All that data has to be stored somewhere, and needs to
    be then trained upon and used by different kinds of AI clouds... And Shelby provides
    a perfect fit for that and actually saves on the egress fees tremendously.
  topic: technology/adoption
- impact_reason: 'Articulates a clear Web3 value proposition for the creator economy:
    true ownership, control over monetization (ads), and algorithmic autonomy.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The second use case is interesting is around creators. Creators today use
    different platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and others... And this is
    an opportunity for creators to really drive the platform the way they want to
    drive it. They can have their own content, own their own content, dictate which
    ads are being served, and also have the full control over how the content is used
    with their permission.
  topic: Web3 vision/creator economy
- impact_reason: Presents a vision for scaling blockchain infrastructure by integrating
    centralized, high-speed components (namespaces) with decentralized consensus,
    achieving performance metrics competitive with traditional systems (10ms latency
    within namespaces).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The future we described is around what we call namespaces, the ability for
    us to have these kind of centralized, like essentially exchange-type workloads,
    happening in different data centers and different locations, but tied together
    through a very high-speed fiber internet that is faster than any blockchain today.

- impact_reason: Articulates a powerful, agent-centric vision for Web3 where autonomous
    software interacts financially on-chain, moving beyond simple user transactions.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The future is really about us also having agents deploying on our behalf,
    trading assets on our behalf, paying bills, kind of conversing with each other
    through transactional means. And that's exactly what this technology unlocks,
    which is everything can happen on-chain.

    systems as the necessary evolution beyond both traditional CEXs and current 'decentralized'
    alternatives that retain opacity.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We have centralized exchanges which we must trust inherently because we have
    no choice. We have things like a Hyperliquid, which seem to be better, but they're
    still closed source. But there's this missing piece of fully decentralized, fully
    on-chain in which everything is well known, everything is understood, and there
    are no questions about it.

    the critical need for on-chain transparency to audit and understand systemic failures

    order submission, on-chain matching, and on-chain settlement, contrasting with
    hybrid models.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But for Decibel, we're taking, I think, the really, really hard approach of
    saying when you submit an order, that order is going to be shown on-chain, that
    order is going to be matched on-chain with the matching algorithm that everyone
    can look at and take a ticket, and also the results of that will be published
    on-chain.

    offering a framework for understanding stablecoin strategy.

  text: So for example, USDT is used very heavily outside the US, USDC, thinking of

    niche.

    superior speed and low cost, making it ideal for high-volume, low-value transactions.'

    to Aptos, we immediately become the fastest, most performant, and cheapest version
    of stablecoin across the world.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Aptos Betting Big on Transparency After Crypto’s Black
  Friday (Ep. 927)


  This episode features an in-depth conversation with **Avery Cheng, CEO of Aptos**,
  focusing on the blockchain''s strategic pivot toward building transparent, high-performance
  financial infrastructure, particularly in response to recent market opacity events.
  The discussion covers Aptos''s origins, its core technological differentiators (Move
  language), and its ambitious product roadmap targeting global trading and decentralized
  cloud computing.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Web3 infrastructure**, specifically Layer 1 (L1) blockchain
  development, decentralized finance (DeFi) trading mechanisms, the necessity of transparency
  following centralized exchange failures, and the emerging intersection of blockchain
  technology with **AI/Cloud Computing**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Move Language Advantage:** Aptos leverages the **Move language**, which was
  specifically designed for secure asset management, positioning it as superior to
  the EVM for specialized, high-performance trading applications.

  *   **Namespaces and Performance:** Aptos is architecting its infrastructure using
  "namespaces" connected by high-speed fiber, aiming for **10ms latency within namespaces**
  and 50ms across them, enabling centralized exchange-level performance for on-chain
  operations.

  *   **Fully On-Chain Matching:** The flagship trading product, Decibel, is designed
  for **fully on-chain order submission, matching, and settlement**, contrasting sharply
  with current "decentralized" exchanges that rely on opaque, off-chain order matching
  systems.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Trading as the Core Value Add:** Aptos has strategically focused its mission
  on building the **"global trading engine,"** recognizing that asset trading generates
  massive revenue ($50B annually) that is currently captured almost entirely by centralized
  entities.

  *   **Decentralized Cloud Opportunity:** The second major bet is on **decentralized
  cloud computing and AI infrastructure**, viewing this $300B industry as the next
  major wave for decentralization usage, exemplified by the launch of Shelby.

  *   **Transparency Premium:** The recent crypto market instability highlighted the
  market''s demand for verifiable systems. Aptos aims to capture market share by offering
  **unmatched transparency** in trading, which centralized and semi-decentralized
  competitors cannot match.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Avery Cheng (CEO, Aptos):** Former crypto lead for the **Libra/Diem** project
  at Meta (Facebook), bringing deep experience in building global-scale payments infrastructure.

  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion implicitly addresses regulatory concerns by emphasizing **transparency
  as a solution to opacity**. Cheng noted that if recent market events (referencing
  the "Black Friday" collapse of a major entity) had occurred on a fully transparent,
  on-chain system like Decibel, the chain of events, market manipulation, and profit
  distribution would be entirely visible and auditable, contrasting with the current
  "black box" nature of centralized finance.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The long-term vision is an **"on-chain economy"** where daily life—getting paid,
  earning yield, having AI agents automatically manage investments (rebalancing portfolios
  every minute)—occurs seamlessly on decentralized infrastructure. This future relies
  on Aptos achieving CEX-level performance to support high-frequency, low-cost transactions
  for billions of users globally.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Web3 infrastructure developers, blockchain
  investors, DeFi strategists, and technology executives** interested in the next
  generation of L1 scaling solutions and the convergence of blockchain with AI/Cloud
  services.'
