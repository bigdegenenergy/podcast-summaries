  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I wanted to get Matt on to talk about something that's very interesting to
    me, which is crypto-market-making. How do these deals work? What are the bad actors
    seemingly doing? And why do new crypto tokens sometimes go to zero in a day?
  topic: investment/adoption
- impact_reason: 'Highlights the crucial difference: crypto assets exhibit strong,
    sustained trends (non-mean-reverting behavior), which fundamentally breaks traditional
    market-making assumptions.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Crypto is really not like that [mean-reverting]. We can take a lot of examples,
    some on the upside, like Solana, right, trading started at 75 cents, went to $200
    in about a year and a half. That's a straight line up.
  topic: investment/technology
- impact_reason: 'Explains the direct P&L risk for market makers in trending crypto
    markets: they are forced to accumulate massive short positions against assets
    that only go up.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: As a result, a market maker who's providing offers on something like Solana,
    for example, will be continuously selling and selling and selling as price goes
    up and of course getting shorter and shorter and shorter and I said that you really
    don't want to be short, right, something that money goes up.
  topic: investment/strategy
- impact_reason: 'Reveals the core innovation in crypto market-making compensation:
    structuring the loan with an embedded call option to hedge against massive upward
    price moves.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: they eventually came up with this really elegant structure, which is essentially
    a call option to protect the market maker. And the call option is embedded in
    the loan itself.
  topic: defi/technology
- impact_reason: 'Illustrates the protective power of the structure: the market maker
    can sell into a massive rally and still cover their short obligation at the low,
    pre-agreed strike price.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The strike price is the price at which you can purchase the option in normal
    option parlance. So with that, now the market maker is protected, right? So the
    market maker for Solana, again, Solana example, you start the market at 75 cents
    on day one, a year later, it's at $150, it's all good because you can actually
    buy back the tokens at a dollar from the Solana foundation because that price
    was established at launch.
  topic: investment/strategy
- impact_reason: 'Identifies the primary structural flaw: when the option/loan size
    is too large relative to the circulating supply, it concentrates too much control.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The call option might be way too big, right, and so when you have a call option
    that is way too large and when I say too large, it means that the loan extended
    to the market maker represents too much of the circulating supply.
  topic: regulation/strategy
- impact_reason: Introduces a novel concept—the 'magnet effect'—explaining how concentrated
    options can artificially pin the token price to the strike price, preventing organic
    discovery.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There is something that's called the magnet effect of the call option, which
    means when the call option presents too big a part of the circulating supply,
    the strike of the call option is going to act like a magnet towards which the
    price is going to converge all the time.
  topic: technology/investment
- impact_reason: This is a severe indictment of large, concentrated options, stating
    that they destroy genuine price discovery and lead to a controlled market environment.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Because of that, the offering is too large. The token price basically cannot
    achieve healthy price discovery. It's stuck at the strike, and that's a big problem
    because the market is in no longer presented. The market no longer works. It's
    completely controlled because of that gamma trading effect.
  topic: regulation/adoption
- impact_reason: 'Reveals the ultimate, highly profitable strategy for a market maker
    with a large loan during a downturn: shorting spot for free while simultaneously
    longing the perpetuals to collect negative funding payments.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Whereas if you roll the tokens, not only can go short the spot for free. There's
    no funding to pay. There is no interest rate to pay on these market-making deals,
    but also you can capture the perps arbitrage, meaning by the perps, which is now
    paying you funding rate and sales putt.
  topic: investment/defi
- impact_reason: 'This is a crucial distinction: in a retainer deal (deposit), the
    client bears 100% of the trading losses, unlike a loan/option structure where
    the downside is capped.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What's the main difference between a deposit and a loan? Well, a deposit,
    the market maker essentially at the end of the engagement is going to return to
    the client, to the foundation, whatever is in there while it, meaning if the market
    maker has done a bad job or the markets were horrible and they lost a lot of money,
    they're just going to return less tokens to the foundation.
  topic: DeFi/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'A concise summary of the asymmetric risk profile of retainer deals:
    upside profit sharing, but downside liability is entirely on the protocol/foundation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: That's true on the upside, but on the downside, 100% of the loss is for the
    client. That's very important to get.
  topic: DeFi/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'This is a major critique of retainer deals: they fail precisely
    when liquidity is most needed (during high volatility), rendering them ineffective
    during market stress events.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: When crisis starts to go up a lot or down a lot, market makers pull everything
    for simple reason. The retainers just never enough, paste the kind of loss they
    would have otherwise. So when you think about it, only when you really need liquidity,
    which is what moves, it doesn't work anymore.
  topic: Adoption/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'This is the core definition of ''Active Market-Making'' as perceived
    by the speaker: actively steering the price in a direction beneficial to the client,
    strongly implying market manipulation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And so when you were to look at the description that they put out, publicly
    back then, it was really about, well, active market-making is really about, you
    know, kind of helping your price goes in a direction that makes sense for you,
    the client. They're like, oh, what? Like, that sounds very, very manipulative
    potentially.
  topic: Regulation/Investment
- impact_reason: 'Details the core service offered: promising founders complete control
    over token price, framing price management as a technical fix rather than a market
    function.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Founders are being told by these active market makers that they have a solution
    for the price of their token. You don't like the price of your token. It's a bit
    like an engineering problem that you have on your protocol, it's a bit like a
    bug that you subscribe. We have a solution for it. We can help you put the token
    price wherever you want it to go.
  topic: adoption/strategy
- impact_reason: Exposes a critical vulnerability in how major crypto data aggregators
    source circulating supply data—relying solely on protocol input without independent
    verification.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: You can say the circulating supply is whatever you want. As you well know,
    I'm sure, CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, they receive the circulating supply number
    directly from the protocol. So there is zero DD, zero check there, right? So you
    can really put it anywhere you want on the screen.
  topic: technology/regulation
- impact_reason: 'Reveals the core mechanism for generating immediate cash flow for
    price manipulation: selling future-locked tokens at a discount for immediate liquidity.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: You sell liquid tokens to buy them back. No, it doesn't work. So you have
    to sell tokens that are locked. These tokens you cannot, you cannot actually,
    the person buying them from you is not going to receive them until three months,
    six months, nine months from now. Right? However, you get the proceeds today.
  topic: defi/investment

    cash to create artificial momentum (''fake it till you make it'') while deferring
    the massive future liability.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Now you start to see how things maybe can go wrong. But that's a problem for
    the future. What the active market maker is saying is, hey, don't worry about
    it. Don't worry about the future. With all the cash, you're going to send the
    thing up great momentum because you can have great momentum, you can have great
    video opportunities. You can point to your token saying and look at what the success
    story we are. And as a result, you can really kind of fake it till you make it.
  topic: strategy/adoption
- impact_reason: Provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how derivative trading
    (perpetuals) accelerates the spot price collapse, linking perp weakness directly
    to spot market failure.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And so everybody piles on to the trade, everybody who bought the lock tokens
    piles on to the short perps, short perps pushing the price of the perp lower until
    people are done hedging. And by that time, of course, the price is estimated,
    right? Because the short perp, the funding rate is super low. So anybody who has
    long tokens, by the way, that's probably the active market maker as well, buys
    back the perps, sell spots. And so the perp weakness percolates into the spot
    weakness.
  topic: defi/market trends

    toxic and unsustainable.

    scheme, relying on continuous new buying pressure to service past obligations.

    that well, it's going to reach escape velocity. And so you're kind of leveraging
    your future.

    is rapidly shrinking as market participants become more sophisticated, increasing
    the risk of immediate failure.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And so the answer is the earlier you did this, the easier it's going to get
    to get away from it, to get away with it. As you can see, the window with which
    the market may, you know, kind of ring the bell of reality for you is getting
    shorter and shorter. It might have been nine months before, now it's only three
    weeks.

    are waking up to the fact that, oh, actually, there is a lot of risks attached
    to it.
  topic: adoption/regulation

    psychological and market benchmark, which is often artificially inflated, leading
    to long-term negative sentiment.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: As a result, the benchmark for the eternity of the token is that price on
    day one, even with the first hour, that first candle. Why is that? And then people
    are like, oh, crypto is not only. Well, it's not only because the initial price
    is always invariably way too high.

    retail buyers executing market orders without regard for price.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced

  topic: adoption/investment
- impact_reason: Explains the 'Green Shoe' option, a crucial volatility reduction
    mechanism from TradFi that crypto projects should adopt to manage post-launch
    price spikes.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: In traditional finance that's called the green shoe option. That option is
    essentially very schematically to simplify. It's a little more complicated than
    that, but to simplify, it says that if the IPO does extremely well, the bank that
    is leading the IPO... has the right to increase the size of the IPO, meaning to
    issue more shares, to grow the size of the IPO. By adding supply, they're going
    to calm things down.
  topic: technology/strategy
- impact_reason: Proposes a specific, on-chain implementation of the Green Shoe mechanism
    using smart contracts for post-launch stabilization, earmarking proceeds for buybacks.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: It is that the project should have that green shoe option built in, which
    is something like selling tokens continuously, if the price of the token launches
    above, I'd be a price of token launch price. And that proceeds that are put in
    the smart contract, that's not for the founders, that's not, you know, exactly
    the liquidity, it stays in the smart contract, and it's only unlocked and used
    to buy back the token, if and when it trades below the token launch price.
  topic: technology/defi
- impact_reason: 'Presents a counter-intuitive investment thesis: selling cheaper
    initially, combined with stabilization tools, leads to more sustainable long-term
    growth and success than chasing maximum initial valuation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The lower the foundation is willing to sell tokens at, the better they are
    selling themselves for success. It might seem counterintuitive, except for they're
    selling something for cheap, but think about it. When Blasmai is selling 10% of
    their network at 50 million valuation, when they could probably have achieved
    10 times more, that means that that starting price, if they have the stabilization
    mechanism in place, that starting price will be very low, which will be easier,
    way easier to impress from it than starting at 5B.

    some tokens are adequate, but you know, therefore grants, etc., etc., typically
    they're not selling too many tokens around launch. So really, market makers are
    among the largest single holders of tokens.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: The Truth Behind Crypto Market Makers | Matt
  Jobbé-Duval


  This 65-minute episode of *Light Speed* features Jack Cubanek interviewing Matt
  Jobbé-Duval, co-founder of CoinWatch, an advisory firm specializing in negotiating
  token launch and market-making deals for crypto projects (including Gido, Optimism,
  and Sui). The discussion dives deep into the often-opaque world of crypto market-making,
  contrasting it with traditional finance and exposing the structures that can lead
  to extreme price volatility and token collapse.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Crypto Market-Making Mechanics and Incentives**. Key sub-topics
  include the structure of market-making agreements (specifically the "call option"
  loan structure vs. "retainer" deals), the inherent risks in crypto volatility, and
  how these structures can be exploited, leading to price manipulation and sudden
  token crashes.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **The Call Option Loan Structure:** Market makers are often compensated via
  a loan of native tokens, which they must repay after a set period (usually one year)
  either with the tokens or a fixed USD amount (the strike price). This structure
  effectively acts as a built-in call option, protecting the market maker from massive
  upside risk by allowing them to buy back tokens cheaply if the price skyrockets.

  *   **Retainer Deals vs. Option Deals:** Retainer deals involve fixed monthly payments
  for liquidity provision, but the underlying tokens are often held as a **deposit**,
  not a loan. This means the market maker bears no downside risk; any losses are passed
  entirely to the client foundation, making these deals look deceptively cheap but
  offering inferior liquidity during crises.

  *   **The Magnet Effect:** When a call option loan is too large relative to the
  circulating supply, the strike price acts as a "magnet." Through gamma trading incentives,
  the market maker is forced to sell when the price rises above the strike and buy
  when it falls below, artificially pinning the price near the strike and preventing
  healthy price discovery.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Risk of Trend-Following Assets:** Unlike traditional assets that are mean-reverting,
  crypto tokens exhibit strong intrinsic trends (straight-line rallies or collapses).
  This makes standard market-making difficult, necessitating the complex option-based
  compensation structure to protect against being continuously short during a rally.

  *   **Liquidity Quality Varies by Structure:** Option deals generally provide superior,
  more reliable liquidity, especially during periods of high volatility, because the
  market maker has skin in the game (the loan obligation). Retainer deals often see
  liquidity vanish precisely when it is needed most (during sharp rallies or crashes).

  *   **Warning Against "Active Market-Making":** The term, sometimes associated with
  firms like DWF, is presented skeptically. It often implies strategies that go beyond
  passive quoting, potentially involving aggressive positioning or manipulation that
  can lead to extreme, non-organic price movements (like the 99% overnight drops seen
  in some tokens).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Matt Jobbé-Duval (CoinWatch):** The expert guest, providing insider knowledge
  from negotiating dozens of market-making deals.

  *   **Jump & GSR:** Mentioned as pioneers in developing the embedded call option
  structure for market-making compensation back in 2017/2018.

  *   **Projects Mentioned:** Gido, Optimism, Sui (clients of CoinWatch); Solana (used
  as a primary volatility example); Polyhedra (ZKJ), Mantra, and Solare (used as examples
  of extreme, potentially manipulated price charts).


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  While no specific regulatory framework was detailed, the discussion heavily implies
  that these opaque, highly leveraged structures (especially the ability of market
  makers to short spot assets for free via the loan structure) operate in a regulatory
  gray area, contributing to market instability and investor harm. The lack of transparency
  in these private deals is a core issue.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward greater scrutiny of these backend deals. Protocols
  need to adopt rigorous tracking mechanisms (like CoinWatch provides) to monitor
  market maker performance and prevent the toxic outcomes associated with oversized
  call options or unreliable retainer agreements. The prevalence of extreme price
  action suggests that many current token launches are relying on structures that
  prioritize market maker profit over sustainable token health.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto Professionals, Token Founders/Protocol Teams, Institutional Investors,
  and Advanced Traders.** Anyone involved in launching a new token, negotiating liquidity
  agreements, or analyzing the underlying mechanics of crypto price action will find
  this highly valuable.'
