summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: HUGE SUI, HBAR, XLM PUMP (THESE ALTCOINS Can
  Make You RICH)


  This 5-minute podcast episode focuses entirely on short-term technical analysis
  and potential profit targets for three specific altcoins that have recently experienced
  significant price pumps, suggesting they are poised for further "magnificent breakouts"
  following Bitcoin''s new all-time high.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**: Cryptocurrency trading and technical analysis (TA) of specific
  altcoins showing strong recent momentum.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **Sway (SWAY)**: The speaker identified a classic wedge pattern on the chart,
  projecting a potential target of **$7.50** based on measuring the pattern''s breakout
  distance. However, the speaker noted high leverage longing, suggesting a potential
  "sweep" of liquidity (a temporary price drop) might occur before the expected upward
  move.

  *   **Hedera (HBAR)**: Key resistance is identified at **$0.265**, a level that
  acted as resistance multiple times in the previous cycle. A successful breach of
  this level, confirmed by a long-term trend line on the weekly chart, points toward
  a next target range of **$0.31 to $0.32**.

  *   **Stellar Lumens (XLM)**: XLM showed a "clean breakout" on the weekly chart
  after prolonged resistance. The immediate short-term target is projected around
  **$0.60**, with a more significant long-term target identified near **$0.63**.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   The host suggests that while Bitcoin has hit new highs (reportedly over $120,000
  at one point), these three altcoins offer better potential for life-changing gains
  at this stage.

  *   **Actionable Advice**: If forced to choose only one, the speaker favors **Sway**,
  targeting the $7.50 range. HBAR is noted as having more room to run toward its $0.32
  target compared to XLM, which has already seen a substantial pump (83% in a week).

  *   **HBAR Valuation Warning**: A critical distinction is made between token price
  and market capitalization for HBAR, noting that the circulating supply is significantly
  higher now (42 billion tokens, heading toward 50 billion) than in the previous cycle,
  which impacts its true valuation relative to its all-time high market cap.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Sway, Hedera (HBAR), and Stellar Lumens (XLM)**: The three primary focus tokens.

  *   **Algorand (ALGO)**: Mentioned briefly as a token to watch out for, though no
  specific analysis was provided in the main segment.

  *   **DZ Ford Discover Crypto**: The host providing the analysis.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**: None discussed; the content is purely technical
  trading analysis.


  **6. Future Implications**: The episode implies a continuation of the current crypto
  bull market where specific, high-momentum altcoins can outperform Bitcoin significantly
  in the short term, provided traders correctly identify key technical resistance
  and support levels.


  **7. Target Audience**: Intermediate to advanced cryptocurrency traders and investors
  focused on short-term momentum plays and technical chart analysis.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  This podcast episode, titled "HUGE SUI, HBAR, XLM PUMP," serves as a rapid-fire
  technical analysis session following a major Bitcoin price surge, arguing that the
  real wealth-building opportunities now lie in specific altcoins rather than Bitcoin
  itself. The host, DZ Ford, focuses on three tokens that have demonstrated the strongest
  weekly gains: Sway, Hedera (HBAR), and Stellar Lumens (XLM).


  The main narrative arc is the identification of these high-momentum assets and the
  projection of specific, actionable price targets based on classical charting techniques.
  The discussion moves sequentially through the three coins, starting with **Sway**,
  which is currently experiencing high leverage longing. The speaker uses wedge pattern
  measurement to project an ambitious target of **$7.50**, but cautions that a liquidity
  sweep might precede this move.


  Next, the analysis shifts to **Hedera (HBAR)**, which is up 50% for the week. The
  critical technical hurdle identified is **$0.265**, a historically significant resistance
  level. The host provides a long-term trend line projection suggesting a next profit-taking
  zone around **$0.31–$0.32** if this resistance is cleared. Crucially, the host warns
  listeners to compare the token price against its growing market capitalization due
  to increasing token issuance (up to 50 billion tokens eventually), suggesting HBAR’s
  current price might be less bullish on a fully diluted basis than it appears.


  **XLM** is presented as the most bullish performer over the last year (up 339%),
  having achieved a "clean breakout" on the weekly chart. After an expected pullback
  from its 83% weekly pump, the short-term target is set at **$0.60**, with a multi-cycle
  trend line pointing toward **$0.63**. The host advises caution on XLM due to its
  already massive recent move, suggesting HBAR might offer better near-term upside
  potential.


  The episode concludes with a direct recommendation: if only one coin could be chosen,
  the host would select **Sway** with a target near $7.50. The entire discussion is
  framed around capitalizing on immediate market momentum rather than long-term fundamentals,
  emphasizing precise entry/exit points derived from technical indicators. The episode
  is interspersed with advertisements for Toyota, a Texas-based online casino (SpinQuest.com),'
