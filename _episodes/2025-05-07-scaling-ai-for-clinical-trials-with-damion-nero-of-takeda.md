    environment (outside of strict drug approval) can be looser than in the EU or
    Asia regarding new technologies like AI integration.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Something that isn't commonly talked about is that the US actually has some
    of the looser regulations. FDA is pretty stringent about the drug approval process.
    You go to the EU, you go to Asia, forget it. The standards are much, much higher
    there and there are a lot of requirements that they have.

    on proprietary, unexplained third-party algorithms severely limits internal trust
    and explainability, hindering adoption for critical tasks.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We're not really in a position right now where there isn't A, enough trust
    even internally to do that and B, we could actually explain it well. Because also
    keep in mind, we're not building a lot of this in-house. A lot of this is being
    outsourced to third parties. And for many of them, this is a black box type of
    situation where they'll build it for us. Sure, they won't tell us how they did
    it. They'll say, it's a proprietary algorithm that we own and then that's it.

  text: Beyond that, as we get more and more into decentralized trials and really
    just virtualizing a lot of that process as well, where really the interactions
    with HCPs are kept to maybe once during the entire trial, ideally or maybe never.
    That is really, I think, the gold standard that we're moving towards as well to
    get, move past any sort of patient aversion, reduce our costs as well...

    materials that you're going to say, okay, this is a report that is actually showing
    what's happening with these patients and we use AI to generate the results, there
    are a lot of hard questions about that and how this was actually done.

    they like to be hopeful. They have to be hopeful because these patients are facing
    the reality of death. And so many times their assessments in what's reflected
    is not realistic. It's it's a sense that it knows not based on any objective measures
    is the unobjective opinion.

summary: "## Podcast Episode Summary: Scaling AI for Clinical Trials - with Damion\
  \ Nero of Takeda\n\nThis 26-minute episode of the AI and Business Podcast features\
  \ Damion Nero, Head of Data Science in US Medical at Takeda Pharmaceuticals, discussing\
  \ the transformative role of AI and digital technologies in modernizing clinical\
  \ trials and drug development. The core narrative focuses on the shift toward decentralized\
  \ trial models, the systemic challenges hindering widespread AI adoption, and the\
  \ strategic path forward for realizing tangible ROI.\n\n---\n\n1. **Focus Area**:\
  \ **AI in Pharmaceutical Clinical Trials and Drug Development.** Key themes include\
  \ the acceleration of decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), leveraging real-world\
  \ data (RWD), precision medicine applications, and overcoming operational and regulatory\
  \ hurdles for scaling AI solutions.\n\n2. **Key Technical Insights**:\n    * **Decentralized\
  \ Trial Acceleration:** AI is critical for processing the influx of data from remote\
  \ patient interactions (telehealth, electronic consent, chatbots for symptom tracking)\
  \ inherent in decentralized trial models.\n    * **Computer Vision in Diagnostics:**\
  \ AI, particularly computer vision, is making significant strides in objective tumor\
  \ diagnosis by rapidly screening and assessing imaging data, overcoming human subjectivity\
  \ driven by emotional factors.\n    * **Data Integrity and Hallucination Risk:**\
  \ AI models trained on fractured, inconsistent historical site data risk \"exaggerating\"\
  \ effects or generating misleading insights (hallucinations), necessitating strong\
  \ human curation by data scientists.\n\n3. **Market/Investment Angle**:\n    * **Focus\
  \ on High-Volume Areas:** AI impact is currently greatest in areas with large patient\
  \ populations (e.g., oncology) where data volume can adequately train models, rather\
  \ than in rare disease trials where data scarcity is a major constraint.\n    *\
  \ **ROI Driven by Operational Efficiency:** Initial investment justification relies\
  \ on \"low-hanging fruit\"â€”demonstrating clear operational efficiencies and cost\
  \ savings behind the scenes to secure leadership buy-in for more complex, outcome-driving\
  \ AI projects.\n    * **Competitive Catalyst:** Significant industry-wide adoption\
  \ is anticipated once a competitor achieves a major, verifiable success with advanced\
  \ AI, forcing others to follow suit to satisfy investor demands.\n\n4. **Notable\
  \ Companies/People**:\n    * **Damion Nero (Takeda):** Guest expert providing an\
  \ insider's view on AI deployment, data challenges, and internal alignment within\
  \ a major pharmaceutical company.\n    * **Takeda Pharmaceuticals:** The context\
  \ for the discussion, highlighting current strategies in data science and clinical\
  \ operations.\n    * **Metable:** Sponsor of the special series on AI and clinical\
  \ workflow.\n\n5. **Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:\n    * **Global Regulatory Stringency:**\
  \ The US FDA is considered relatively \"looser\" compared to regulatory bodies in\
  \ the EU and Asia, which impose significantly higher standards, complicating the\
  \ deployment of novel AI-driven trial materials globally.\n    * **Internal Alignment\
  \ Challenge:** Achieving consensus among clinical, regulatory, and legal teams regarding\
  \ the use of AI-generated results is a major internal hurdle, often leading companies\
  \ to keep AI applications strictly in administrative or background support roles.\n\
  \    * **Black Box Concerns:** Reliance on third-party vendors for AI development\
  \ often results in proprietary \"black box\" algorithms, which prevents internal\
  \ teams from fully understanding or explaining the methodology to regulators.\n\n\
  6. **Future Implications**:\n    * **Discovery Space Growth:** AI will likely see\
  \ the fastest growth in the drug discovery phase (virtual simulations, candidate\
  \ generation) as it is the least outward-facing and requires less immediate regulatory\
  \ approval.\n    * **Virtualization as Gold Standard:** The long-term goal is to\
  \ move toward fully virtualized trials, minimizing in-person HCP interactions to\
  \ reduce patient aversion and operational costs.\n    * **Shift to Proactive Systems:**\
  \ The ultimate trajectory involves moving beyond operational efficiencies to proactive\
  \ systems that flag risks, draft submissions, and support decisions before issues\
  \ arise, transforming clinical workflows from reactive to predictive.\n\n7. **Target\
  \ Audience**: **Pharmaceutical Professionals, Clinical Operations Leaders, Data\
  \ Science Executives in Healthcare, and Investors focused on HealthTech/Biotech.**\
  \ Professionals needing a realistic, candid assessment of AI scaling challenges\
  \ in highly regulated environments will find this most valuable."
