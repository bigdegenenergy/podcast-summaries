    it handles the necessary context in decision-making, moving beyond pure calculation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There is no physical presence. It's all about knowledge. And why generative
    AI in particular becomes interesting is that not only are we computing, calculating,
    processing information, there is a lot of context in those decision making that
    get done.
  topic: technical/AI trends

    with traditional, verifiable algorithmic calculations and robust data management
    to increase control and accountability.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: How do you bring it with the right data management skills? You know, so how
    do you bring those data management and those systems together so that you can
    get that right? How do you then bring in a generative way? Chat what could be
    triggering out a complex algorithmic calculation for another entity, which can
    then do it in the back and then run it and then you can convert the two together.
  topic: technical/deployment
- impact_reason: 'A critical piece of strategic advice for AI leadership: moving away
    from narrow ''use cases'' to a broader process transformation mindset to unlock
    deeper value.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We stopped talking about use cases. You should talk to do that a lot in the
    early stages of AI because the moment you're saying use case, you've got a very
    narrow mindset about what do you want to do with it and how you can do it and
    so on.
  topic: strategy/business advice
- impact_reason: 'Defines a successful strategic pivot: focusing on end-to-end process
    transformation linked directly to ROI, rather than isolated experiments.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So what we did was we shifted away from use cases and we started talking what
    are the big processes that we are trying to transform and will that end and give
    us the right ROI.
  topic: strategy/business advice
- impact_reason: Provides a clear, practical link between process transformation thinking
    and the emergence of 'Agent AI' architectures, explaining how complex processes
    are decomposed into specialized agents.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What it did was it automatically started creating for us an ability to say,
    okay, this part can be done very well with generative AI. You can bring it in.
    This part can be done by better calculations. This part can be done by better
    getting data management right now. Let's speak it all together and by the way,
    it also led to what you are now hearing is a big term again and again is agent
    AI because the moment you say I want to transform this entire process, it starts
    saying I need a bunch of agents just the way you used to need a bunch of humans
    to work that process and now each of these agents is getting good at one small
    thing and very good at that and started to connect them.
  topic: technical/AI trends
- impact_reason: 'Defines what a mature AI roadmap looks like: process transformation
    and data foundation building must precede specific use case selection.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: A good enterprise AI roadmap is definitely not a bunch of puzzle pieces that
    just have a use case name on them. It's really about, as you're bringing up, fundamentally
    altering business processes, layering up the sort of data foundations that are
    underneath them.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: 'Articulates the ''Goldilocks Zone'' for initial AI projects: significant
    enough to matter, small enough to execute and prove value quickly.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The best way to do it is to start not too small and not too big. You start
    somewhere, which is big enough that it makes a huge impact, something which really
    creates and starts the flywheel going and not too big enough that you cannot make
    an impact.

    infrastructure (LLMs, base tech) and Build the final layer that constitutes proprietary
    IP and client value.'

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: if we are providing something to the our clients, that's our IP, that's the
    part where we are adding value. So all the underlying data and how we piecing
    those capabilities together, where are we getting the LLMs from, where are we
    getting the God rates from, there's a lot that we can buy from outside as things
    keep evolving.

    requirements, data connectivity, and multi-user collaboration, which are common
    hurdles in regulated industries.'

  text: The parts where the bigger challenges happen is that the moment you need to
    get super accurate, the moment you need to come connected to individual sources
    of data and the moment you need one person to collaborate with another person,
    you start realizing that there are little pieces of friction that all need to
    be managed before we go off.

    change, not just superficial application-level fixes.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The amount of change required is not a use case level of change. It's a foundation
    level of change, but that attitude has not been common.
  topic: strategy

    shift from pilots to process transformation, serving as a strong business justification
    for foundational work.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Unless you make a pivoted shift towards say, what's my path to ROI? There
    is no way you can continue this process. The moment you start thinking ROI, you're
    forced to think short term, medium term, long term, you're starting to think processes.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Driving AI Adoption in Wealth and Asset Management
  - with Deep Srivastav of Franklin Templeton


  This 32-minute podcast episode features Deep Srivastav, Chief AI Officer at Franklin
  Templeton, discussing the strategic shift required for successful AI implementation
  in the wealth and asset management industry. The core narrative moves from acknowledging
  the early stages of AI adoption to outlining a process-transformation-focused roadmap
  necessary to achieve meaningful ROI, moving beyond isolated "band-aid" use cases.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Enterprise AI Adoption Strategy in Wealth and Asset
  Management**. Key themes include overcoming organizational friction points, the
  necessity of shifting focus from narrow use cases to **end-to-end business process
  transformation**, the critical role of data harmonization, and structuring an AI
  roadmap that balances short-term impact with long-term strategic goals. Generative
  AI''s role in a knowledge-based industry is also highlighted.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Blending Capabilities for Control:** Achieving high accuracy and accountability
  in financial services requires blending pure Generative AI capabilities with traditional
  AI/ML models and robust data management systems (e.g., using algorithmic calculations
  verified by GenAI outputs).

  *   **Rise of Agentic AI:** The focus on transforming entire business processes
  naturally leads to the concept of **Agent AI**, where specialized, highly competent
  AI agents are orchestrated to replace the human workflow previously required for
  that process.

  *   **Harnessing Unstructured Data:** A major technical opportunity lies in integrating
  and harnessing unstructured data alongside structured data to build comprehensive
  client profiles and improve personalization, moving beyond traditional data silos.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Process Transformation over Use Cases:** Leaders must stop focusing on isolated
  use cases and instead target **large-scale business process transformation** to
  ensure clear, measurable ROI and sustained impact.

  *   **Democratization of Advice:** AI offers a pathway to broaden the base of investors
  who can access sophisticated financial advice, moving the industry beyond serving
  only high-net-worth clients ("doctors to the healthy").

  *   **Goldilocks Roadmap Selection:** Successful roadmaps require finding the "Goldilocks
  zone"—projects large enough to create significant flywheel impact but small enough
  to deliver measurable results in a reasonable timeframe (short, medium, and long-term
  wins).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Deep Srivastav (Franklin Templeton):** Chief AI Officer, providing an insider''s
  perspective on strategic implementation and organizational change management.

  *   **Franklin Templeton:** Used as a primary case study for shifting strategy from
  use cases to process transformation.

  *   **FE Fund Info:** Sponsor of the special podcast series.

  *   **Jane Street (Mentioned in passing):** Referenced as an example of firms potentially
  doing interesting work in garnering specific, personalized market insights.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a future where AI enables **near-constant, highly
  personalized dialogue** with clients and advisors, managing complex, interconnected
  life circumstances (investments, health, taxes). The emphasis will be on building
  foundational capabilities rather than deploying point solutions, forcing a fundamental
  reassessment of data governance and cross-functional collaboration.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Senior Technology Leaders (CIOs, CDOs), Chief
  AI Officers, Heads of Digital Transformation, and Business Strategy Executives**
  within the Wealth and Asset Management sector, as well as consultants advising these
  firms. It is less focused on deep technical implementation details and more on strategic
  governance and organizational alignment.'
