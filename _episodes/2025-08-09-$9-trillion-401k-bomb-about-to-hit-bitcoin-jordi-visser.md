    arguing what people that I know what they need. They need to do the traditional

    just like they did for Amazon. They have to come up with a valuation, and the
    easiest thing for them to do is to look at the growth curves and go, "Hey, stablecoin
    volumes are ripping, stablecoin market cap is ripping. I want to invest in that.
    What's the best way to play it?" And then you go search, and Tom Lee shows up
    saying, "You want to be Ethereum."

  text: I don't think that the Wall Street crowd, from the people I talk with, understand
    how much of an assault, like a bottoms-up blockchain assault, there is on this

    some of them run on Ethereum. I'm going to buy Ether because that's like my index
    on the stablecoins." But if we end up getting, you know, stablecoin-specific blockchains,

summary: 'This podcast episode of the Pom Podcast, featuring Anthony Pompliano and
  guest Jordi Visser, centers on the massive potential impact of regulatory shifts—specifically
  allowing Bitcoin exposure in 401(k)s—and the broader macroeconomic and technological
  forces (like AI) shaping the future of digital assets.


  Here is the comprehensive summary:


  ### Comprehensive Summary: $9 Trillion 401k Bomb About To Hit Bitcoin | Jordi Visser


  The core narrative of the discussion revolves around the monumental significance
  of the recent decision allowing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to be included in 401(k)
  retirement accounts, a pool estimated at nearly **$9 trillion**. Visser argues this
  is a massive catalyst, coinciding with growing government comfort (evidenced by
  ETF approvals) and increased public education, which strips away the perceived volatility
  risk for long-term investors.


  A key theme is the **re-evaluation of risk** in traditional portfolios. Visser and
  Pompliano suggest that traditional "safe" assets, like long-duration bonds (TLT
  is cited as being down 50% over five years), are proving riskier than assets like
  Bitcoin when viewed through the lens of extended lifespans (living to 100-110, enabled
  by AI). For long-duration retirement planning, growth assets like Bitcoin become
  necessary hedges against inflation and longevity risk.


  The conversation then shifts to **market dynamics and volatility compression**.
  Visser notes that implied volatility in Bitcoin has sharply decreased, making it
  palatable for larger, more conservative capital pools. He suggests this compression
  acts like a "coiled spring," setting up for a major, asymmetric breakout, especially
  once key resistance levels are breached. He attributes some of the suppressed volatility
  to heavy selling of upside options and corporate treasury activity (like MicroStrategy''s
  strategies).


  A significant portion of the discussion contrasts **Bitcoin and Ethereum**. While
  Pompliano argues that institutional capital is flowing into Ethereum due to its
  role as the backbone for stablecoin volume and innovation narratives (like network
  effects), Visser expresses skepticism. He points out that Ethereum has failed to
  reclaim its 2021 all-time high, even in fiat terms, while Bitcoin has surpassed
  it. Visser suggests that developers and "mercenaries" are moving toward newer, faster
  chains (like Solana or stablecoin-specific blockchains like those potentially backed
  by Tether/Tron) because Ethereum is losing its technological edge, making its current
  capital flow potentially a lagging trade based on outdated narratives.


  Finally, the discussion touches on **AI and the global stablecoin race**. Visser
  posits that AI (specifically GPT-5) is a trigger point that will disrupt traditional
  code-based moats, making the digital economy, built on immutable code (Bitcoin/Ethereum),
  a necessary hedge. Furthermore, he sees global central bank actions regarding stablecoins
  (China pushing a yuan-backed stablecoin, ECB concern) as forcing the US government
  to inadvertently support the digital asset ecosystem, potentially leading to a "rebellion
  against governments" where digital assets become the preferred infrastructure.

  ### Key Professional Insights:


  | Category | Insights |

  | :--- | :--- |

  | **1. Focus Area** | Bitcoin adoption via 401(k)s, macroeconomic risk re-evaluation,
  volatility dynamics, competitive landscape between major crypto protocols (BTC vs.
  ETH), and the impact of AI on traditional finance moats. |

  | **2. Key Technical Insights** | Volatility compression in Bitcoin is making it
  acceptable for institutional buyers; the potential for a short squeeze due to finite
  supply when covering upside volatility shorts; the rise of stablecoin-specific blockchains
  challenging Ethereum''s dominance in payment rails. |

  | **3. Market/Investment Angle** | The $9T 401(k) pool represents the next major
  demand source; traditional bonds are flagged as a significant hidden risk asset;
  investors should look beyond the "digital gold" narrative for innovation plays,
  but the current ETH flow might be lagging. |

  | **4. Notable Companies/People** | **Jordi Visser** (Investment Thesis on Risk/Volatility),
  **Anthony Pompliano** (Host/Macro View), **Rick Edelman** (mentioned regarding longevity/growth
  assets), **MicroStrategy/Michael Saylor** (cited for volatility suppression strategies),
  **Circle/Tether** (stablecoin players). |

  | **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion** | The allowance of crypto in 401(k)s is a
  massive regulatory tailwind, signaling growing government comfort; US government
  actions around stablecoins are inadvertently accelerating the adoption of decentralized
  digital infrastructure globally. |

  | **6. Future Implications** | The industry is heading toward a phase where long-term
  growth assets are prioritized over traditional fixed income due to longevity and
  inflation; expect asymmetric breakouts following the current volatility compression;
  stablecoin infrastructure competition will intensify beyond just Ethereum. |

  | **7. Target Audience** | Crypto/Digital Asset Investors, Traditional Financial
  Advisors, Macro Strategists, and Retirement Plan Administrators interested in the
  intersection of regulation and asset allocation. |'
