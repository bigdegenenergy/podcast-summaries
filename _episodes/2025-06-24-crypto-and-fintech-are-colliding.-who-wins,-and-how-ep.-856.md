    emerging markets: using Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a direct,
    non-USD-pegged settlement layer for intra-African currency exchange.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And I was thinking this would be a way to create liquidity between currencies.
    And maybe we didn't need to always go to hard currencies to lend and to finance
    local financial institutions. Maybe we could start to trade directly in shilling.
    Maybe we could use Bitcoin as a way to trade between shilling and Naira or shilling
    and South African Rand.
  topic: Investment Thesis/DeFi
- impact_reason: This is a core strategic insight, emphasizing utility-driven adoption
    of crypto technology rather than building crypto for crypto's sake. It frames
    crypto as an enabling tool for existing business problems (like cross-border payments).

    going to launch this network, the Stellar network, or something like this. And
    everybody's going to use it. Yeah, but then you have to go one by one when each
    of those clients onboard them, have good rates, have good servers, have a good

    They scaled and they kind of showed the telcos that they could leapfrog, all these
    were there, leapfrog, those oligopolies, which is what they were.
  topic: business/strategy
- impact_reason: Provides a crucial, nuanced update on African crypto regulation,
    noting that initial licensing in major markets like Nigeria often favors unknown
    entities over established players.

    and compliance features.'

    power and compliance capabilities of the Global South, suggesting self-sufficiency
    outside of traditional North American/European dominance.

    perfect chord in my heart, which is that the global south is very powerful. It
    is compliant. You can do business here. You can trade across borders.
  topic: Strategy/Adoption
- impact_reason: Provides a historical framework showing that current Web3/crypto
    innovations are evolutionary steps of existing FinTech, focusing on the same core
    financial activities but with new access layers (USSD -> Web -> Blockchain ->
    Metaverse).

  text: Mobile money was just a version of FinTech at the time, because they were
    the weirdos at the conference in the beginning... Now we're seeing it go into
    the metaverse, or wherever you want to go from there. And I think it's the same
    FinTech. We're still lending, sending, saving, right? Spending.
  topic: Technology/Strategy

    ethos in regulated or infrastructure-dependent markets, emphasizing that foundational
    business hygiene (governance, compliance) ultimately dictates success.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Crypto and Fintech Are Colliding. Who Wins, and How?
  - Ep. 856


  This episode of Unchained features host Laura Shin in conversation with **Elizabeth
  Rosiello**, CIO and founder of As of Finance (formerly Bitpass), discussing the
  collision between traditional FinTech and the crypto space, viewed through the lens
  of her company''s pioneering work in African cross-border payments. The discussion
  highlights how emerging markets, particularly in Africa, have already navigated
  the technological shifts the US and global finance are only now beginning to experience.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **convergence of Crypto/Web3 and traditional FinTech**,
  specifically examining the evolution of cross-border payments, remittances, and
  local currency trading in emerging markets, using Africa as the central case study.
  Key themes include the role of mobile money (like M-Pesa), the utility of Bitcoin
  and stablecoins as settlement layers, and the strategic shift from retail to wholesale
  B2B payment solutions.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin as an Early Liquidity Bridge:** Initially, As of Finance used Bitcoin
  as a fast, cheap intermediary technology to bridge African currencies with global
  hard currencies (like USD) for international payments, bypassing slow and expensive
  traditional correspondent banking rails.

  *   **Stablecoin Dominance in Volume:** Demand rapidly shifted from Bitcoin/ETH
  to stablecoins (primarily USDC) for crypto volume about four to five years ago,
  surprising the founder who initially favored Bitcoin''s perceived stability. Stablecoins
  are now preferred for saving and cross-border settlement due to their perceived
  stability and ease of use.

  *   **The Need for 24/7 Settlement:** The core technical advantage of crypto/stablecoins
  is their ability to settle transactions 24/7/365, which is crucial in markets where
  traditional banking systems are slow (taking 24-48 hours domestically) or closed
  on weekends/holidays, contrasting sharply with the 9-to-5 banking mindset prevalent
  in some Western FinTech circles.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Africa as a Leapfrog Market:** The African FinTech scene, catalyzed by M-Pesa,
  has already experienced the rapid adoption curve that the US is now seeing with
  institutions like JPM launching tokens on Base.

  *   **Shift to Wholesale/B2B:** The company pivoted from serving retail customers
  to focusing on high-volume corporate clients and remittance companies, realizing
  the superior unit economics of wholesale transactions (e.g., a $35,000 payment vs.
  a $5 retail transaction).

  *   **Competition Drives Development:** The influx of competitors in African payment
  corridors (like Nigeria and Francophone Africa) is viewed positively as it increases
  competition, drives down costs, and fosters overall market development, even if
  it challenges the founder’s desire for market dominance.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Elizabeth Rosiello & As of Finance (formerly Bitpass):** Founder of what was
  arguably the first crypto exchange connecting directly to mobile money in Africa,
  and one of the first female-founded crypto exchanges globally.

  *   **M-Pesa:** The foundational mobile money innovation in Kenya that set the stage
  for subsequent FinTech growth in the region.

  *   **D-Local:** The cross-border payments provider set to acquire As of Finance
  (pending regulatory approval).

  *   **Barry Silbert:** Early investor in As of Finance, connecting the company to
  the broader US crypto VC ecosystem.

  *   **Western Union/MoneyGram:** Traditional remittance giants that are now trading
  with As of Finance, illustrating the integration of crypto rails into legacy finance.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touches on the historical high friction in African remittances, partly
  due to monopolies and legacy banking infrastructure. Rosiello notes that As of Finance
  proactively sought licensing (UK, Spain) and acquired companies with licenses to
  build regulatory compliance directly into their DNA, ensuring that their entire
  team—compliance, trading, onboarding—understands and integrates crypto knowledge.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests that the future of global payments, especially
  cross-border, will be **crypto-native at the infrastructure level, even if the end-user
  interface is Fiat-based.** The success of stablecoins and 24/7 settlement proves
  that the utility of blockchain rails is undeniable, forcing even traditional players
  (like the 35 largest remittance companies now trading with them) to adopt these
  technologies, whether overtly or covertly. The collision means crypto is no longer
  a fringe concept but the underlying technology enabling modern financial efficiency.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **FinTech executives, institutional investors
  in emerging markets, cross-border payment professionals, and crypto strategists**
  interested in real-world utility cases that bridge decentralized technology with
  regulated financial flows.'
