    ability to generate yield/leverage.

    or direct holding.

    whatever it may be right now for staking Ethereum.

    from retail in the Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs.

    discipline of advisors will naturally reduce the volatility of crypto assets over
    time.'

  text: One of the things that I said I've been saying for a long time, these institutions,
    these advisors, they're going to dampen the vol of these assets, I think, which

    enabled by the coexistence of futures and spot ETFs, showing how TradFi mechanics
    are interacting with the new products.

    I might think it's still pretty big because it's pretty juicy yield right now.
    And that's basically where you sell the futures contract... and then you go long
    the spot ETF.

  - The initial Bitcoin ETFs have been an unprecedented success, accumulating over
    $55 billion in assets, even accounting for GBTC outflows.
  - Ethereum ETFs are also seeing tremendous success, becoming the second-biggest
    launch of all time, though lagging behind Bitcoin's initial performance.
  - ETFs are viewed as the most capital-efficient and regulated way to gain beta exposure
    to the underlying assets, unlike DATs which introduce additional costs and structural
    risks (like inheriting old corporate liabilities).
  - DATs (Digital Asset Trusts) are not seen as competitors to ETFs; Seyffart compares
    them to banks that can potentially trade at a premium to Net Asset Value (NAV)
    if they generate yield or use capital strategically.
  - A major advantage for DATs currently is the ability to earn staking yield on ETH,
    which US-based ETH ETFs currently cannot offer, though this is expected to change.
  - Analysis of 13F filings shows Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs) are the largest
    known holders of the Bitcoin ETFs, followed by hedge funds, suggesting long-term
    allocation strategies that may dampen volatility.
  - The next wave of institutional adoption is expected to come from advisors who
    have not yet onboarded crypto products, while large pensions and endowments may
    prefer separately managed accounts over public ETFs.
  overview: This episode features ETF expert James Seyffart discussing the massive
    success of the initial crypto ETFs, noting that Bitcoin ETFs have seen over $55
    billion in assets since launch, making them the biggest launch of all time. Seyffart
    contrasts ETFs with the emerging DAT (Digital Asset Trust) structure, arguing
    they are complementary rather than competitive, though he highlights the regulatory
    safety and capital efficiency of ETFs over DATs.
