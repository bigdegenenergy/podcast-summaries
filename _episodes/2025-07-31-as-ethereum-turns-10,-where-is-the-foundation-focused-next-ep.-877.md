  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think interoperability is the hardest of the three challenges that we are
    talking about, maybe because scaling L1 and scaling blobs are a continuation of
    something that people have been thinking a lot, and it's very well-defined within
    the protocol. Whereas when you touch interrupt and UX, it's like a thousand small
    pieces and coordination of those between L2s and the ones...

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: As Ethereum Turns 10, Where Is the Foundation
  Focused Next? - Ep. 877


  This 80-minute episode features an in-depth interview with **Tamas Hontzchek, Co-Executive
  Director of the Ethereum Foundation (EF)**, conducted around Ethereum''s 10th anniversary.
  The discussion spans retrospective achievements, current strategic priorities, the
  EF''s evolving role, and Ethereum''s potential future impact, particularly concerning
  AI.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **Ethereum ecosystem''s strategic direction** following
  its 10-year milestone. Key themes include the Ethereum Foundation''s governance
  and mandate, immediate technical priorities (scaling, UX), the relationship between
  the EF and ETH price, and Ethereum''s role in addressing future global coordination
  challenges, specifically around **Artificial Intelligence (AI) centralization**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Short-Term Priorities:** Tamas identified the three main short-term priorities
  for Ethereum development as: 1) Scaling Layer 1 (L1), 2) Scaling "blobs" (i.e.,
  scaling Layer 2 activity), and 3) Improving User Experience (UX).

  *   **Asset Issuance Preference:** Tamas expressed support for the notion that **all
  assets should ideally be minted on the Ethereum L1**, even those currently being
  launched on L2s or sidechains like Base (e.g., creator coins on Zora).

  *   **Interoperability Gap:** The host noted that focusing solely on L1 and L2 scaling
  might be "kicking the can down the road" if the critical issue of **interoperability**
  between chains is not simultaneously addressed.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **EF Stance on ETH Price:** Surprisingly, the EF maintains its historical stance
  of **not prioritizing or focusing on the price of Ether (ETH)**, except when managing
  the foundation''s treasury assets. This contrasts with the community''s recent focus
  on ETH performance relative to competitors like Solana.

  *   **Recent Market Momentum:** The discussion acknowledged the recent positive
  shift, noting accelerated ETH price appreciation and Ether ETF inflows outpacing
  Bitcoin ETFs, signaling renewed ecosystem confidence.

  *   **Maturation for Global Finance:** The network has moved past the "experimentation"
  stage and is now mature enough (with trillion-dollar economic activity potential)
  to onboard global finance, suggesting increased institutional relevance.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Tamas Hontzchek:** Co-Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation, recently
  appointed, bringing a background combining building, DeFi experience, and TradFi
  collaboration.

  *   **Shayway:** The other Co-Executive Director, noted for her deep technical background
  within the EF, particularly in consensus research and the Merge.

  *   **IEA (I amie Kuchi):** The previous Executive Director, involved in Tamas''s
  transition and the leadership shift.

  *   **Vitalik Buterin:** Mentioned regarding his effective work in driving community
  response and regulatory adaptation.

  *   **Zora/Base:** Mentioned as platforms currently seeing new asset issuance, contrasting
  with the EF''s preference for L1 issuance.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  While not a deep dive, the conversation touched upon the community''s need to **react
  faster to the changing regulatory framework**, suggesting that recent community
  activation was partly driven by this external pressure. The EF’s mandate remains
  focused on promoting values like privacy and censorship resistance, which inherently
  carry policy implications.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests Ethereum is positioning itself as the **foundational
  coordination layer for the next wave of digital innovation, specifically AI governance**.
  Tamas connected Ethereum''s permissionless, decentralized nature to resolving fears
  surrounding AI centralization, implying that the next decade of Ethereum development
  will heavily involve attracting thinkers focused on these "big threats to humanity."


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto/Web3 professionals, Ethereum core developers,
  Foundation stakeholders, and strategic investors** interested in the long-term governance,
  technical roadmap, and philosophical direction of the Ethereum ecosystem.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast celebrates Ethereum’s 10th anniversary by interviewing Tamas Hontzchek,
  the recently appointed Co-Executive Director of the Ethereum Foundation (EF). The
  narrative arc moves from reflecting on Ethereum''s resilience—highlighted by 10
  years of 100% uptime and strong developer metrics—to outlining the EF''s renewed
  strategic focus under new leadership.


  Tamas described his leadership style as adopting a **"servant role,"** emphasizing
  aggregation of smart ideas from the ecosystem rather than imposing a top-down vision.
  He detailed the process of his appointment alongside Shayway, noting that his profile
  brought necessary business and TradFi understanding to complement Shayway’s deep
  technical expertise.


  A key revelation was the EF’s continued **disinterest in the market price of ETH**,
  treating it only as a treasury management concern, despite recent community anxieties
  over underperformance relative to competitors.


  Technically, Tamas outlined the immediate roadmap: **L1 scaling, L2 scaling (blobs),
  and UX improvement.** However, the host challenged this by pointing out that these
  steps might neglect the crucial, unsolved problem of **interoperability**. Furthermore,
  Tamas advocated for all new assets to be minted on the L1, suggesting a potential
  standardization push away from L2-native asset creation.


  Reflecting on Ethereum’s stages—from experimentation to robust infrastructure building—Tamas
  positioned the current era as one of **adoption**, driven by larger economic stakes
  (trillion-dollar potential). He connected Ethereum’s core value proposition—permissionless
  coordination—to'
