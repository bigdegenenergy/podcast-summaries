    CRM, the EHRs—what we get is a little blue book with some vaccinations, we get

    just piecing together things to make it look like something to serve my needs.
    And then you think, okay, now I've got to serve other people's needs. I need to

    on my side. So from the provider standpoint, I could see it's like everything's

    and clarifies the intended, focused use of AI: retrieval and simplification, not
    broad search.'
  relevance_score: 9

    to help this person.

summary: '## Comprehensive Summary of Healthy, Wealthy, and Smart Podcast Episode
  with Steve Lewis (Naboo.care.ai)


  This episode of the *Healthy, Wealthy, and Smart* podcast, hosted by Dr. Karen Litzey,
  features an in-depth discussion with **Steve Lewis**, founder of **Naboo.care.ai**.
  The central narrative arc revolves around Lewis''s personal journey from a high-profile
  career in the music industry (working with figures like Lenny Kravitz) to founding
  a health technology company driven by the critical need for better patient-centric
  information management, catalyzed by his daughter Bowie’s complex health journey.


  ### 1. Main Narrative Arc and Key Discussion Points


  The conversation begins by exploring the dramatic career pivot Lewis made after
  his daughter was born prematurely and required intensive care, forcing him into
  a world of complex medical jargon and fragmented information. The core problem identified
  is the **lack of a single, unified source of truth for patients and their families**.
  While clinicians benefit from robust EHRs and CRMs, patients are left managing disparate
  paper records, multiple apps, and inconsistent communication across numerous providers
  (therapists, specialists, suppliers). This fragmentation leads to confusion, redundancy,
  and potential care gaps, especially during transitions (like pediatric to adult
  care) or when multiple caregivers are involved. Naboo.care.ai was conceived to solve
  this by creating a comprehensive, patient-owned digital health record and communication
  hub.


  ### 2. Major Topics, Themes, and Subject Areas Covered


  *   **Patient Advocacy and Empowerment:** Shifting the burden of information management
  from the patient/family to a centralized, accessible tool.

  *   **Healthcare Fragmentation:** The disconnect between provider-side technology
  (EHRs) and patient-side needs.

  *   **Care Coordination:** Improving communication and adherence among family members,
  support workers, and clinical teams.

  *   **Startup Journey and Development:** The process of ideation, early-stage development
  (low-code/no-code), securing development partners, and navigating early funding
  challenges.

  *   **Data Security and Compliance:** The necessity of adhering to standards like
  HIPAA, GDPR, and ISO 27001 in health tech development.

  *   **Safety and Quality Assurance:** Integrating features to vet and monitor support
  workers.


  ### 3. Technical Concepts, Methodologies, or Frameworks Discussed


  *   **Single Source of Truth (SSOT):** The foundational concept for Naboo—a centralized,
  patient-controlled repository for all health data, observations, and documents.

  *   **Low-Code/No-Code Development:** Lewis initially used these methods to rapidly
  prototype the concept based on his personal needs before scaling.

  *   **Interoperability Misconceptions:** A key insight shared was that early-stage
  patient tools should *not* prioritize deep EHR integration, as hospital systems
  are often too customized or restrictive to support it initially. The focus should
  be on the essential information families need.

  *   **Ambient Note-Taking:** The platform incorporates tools (likely AI-assisted)
  to capture provider instructions during appointments.

  *   **Agile Sprints:** The development process involved iterative testing with small
  user groups who provided feedback after each "sprint," validating features based
  on expressed willingness to pay.


  ### 4. Business Implications and Strategic Insights


  *   **Focus on the "Why":** Lewis emphasizes the importance of reminding patients
  *why* they are attending appointments to maintain focus and adherence, a crucial
  element for business success in adherence-dependent fields (like physical therapy).

  *   **Developer Selection:** A critical piece of advice is to choose developers
  who understand the "entrepreneur''s journey," including trial, error, and the need
  to prove the concept before seeking major funding.

  *   **Structural Pitfalls:** The hardest part of founding a startup is often the
  non-product elements: structuring shareholding and organizational setup correctly
  from Day 1 to ensure future scalability.

  *   **Community Engagement:** Lewis found value in targeted health tech innovation
  communities (like Innovation Bay in Australia) over generic startup groups.


  ### 5. Key Personalities, Experts, or Thought Leaders Mentioned


  *   **Steve Lewis:** Founder of Naboo.care.ai.

  *   **Bowie Lewis:** Steve’s daughter, whose experience inspired the product and
  who is now an active advocate and presenter for the app.

  *   **Dr. Peter Steer:** CEO of the Royal Hospital for Children in Melbourne, who
  shared the quote: "Your true calling is where your greatest gladness and the world''s
  deep need meet."

  *   **Frederick Buechner:** Author whose quote Lewis referenced regarding finding
  purpose in personal struggle.

  *   **Leigh Ann Cuncello:** An expert in child protection (UN background) whose
  insights drove Naboo''s rigorous support worker vetting features.

  *   **Ben King:** The developer partner Lewis hired who understood the need to prove
  the concept first.

  *   **James Mellie:** Provided crucial advice on corporate structure and avoiding
  early-stage bottlenecks.


  ### 6. Predictions, Trends, or Future-Looking Statements


  *   **Global Expansion:** Naboo plans to expand compliance and features beyond Australia.

  *   **Shifting Terminology:** Lewis praises the UAE term "People of Determination"
  for individuals with disabilities, suggesting a broader cultural shift toward recognizing
  capability over limitation.

  *   **Focus on Adherence Cost:** The platform aims to reduce the massive financial
  costs associated with poor adherence in care plans (e.g., physiotherapy).


  ### 7. Practical Applications and Real-World Examples


  *   **Family Coordination:** Using the app to share updates (e.g., photos of a gastrostomy
  tube site) with co-parents or remote family members, eliminating repetitive communication
  across group chats.'
