    spot BTC) that is currently highly attractive due to elevated option premiums,
    suggesting market complacency on the upside.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: as an equity person, when you see that you can buy spot Bitcoin and you can
    sell 30% out-of-the-money calls and you can collect what's effectively higher
    than the Fed funds rate for just four or five months, which means on an annualized
    basis, whether it's the calls or the futures, they're trading at a really big
    premium to spot price, which means you're going to get a lot of people that are
    willing to kind of sell options on this.
  topic: DeFi/Investment
- impact_reason: Direct prediction of a short squeeze in Bitcoin driven by options
    market dynamics and underestimation of volatility.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: the upside can be asymmetric, you can get short squeezes, and I believe what
    we're going to see this year at some point is a period where someone gets caught
    short, primarily because of the options stuff and where these calls are priced,
    but also not recognizing how fast this thing can move to the upside where the
    vol can be extremely—it can move very, very quickly.
  topic: Investment/Adoption
- impact_reason: This is a massive macroeconomic prediction challenging the foundation
    of the current global financial system. If true, it implies significant shifts
    in asset valuations and geopolitical power.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The global reserve currency function of the dollar is over. And what comes
    with that is a lot of repricing.
  topic: Investment/Macro
- impact_reason: Directly positions Bitcoin as a favorable asset class (short-duration/inflation
    hedge) in a macro environment that punishes long-duration assets, offering a clear
    crypto thesis.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And one of the benefits from that—it's not just commodities, it's not just
    healthcare, financials—the other place that is very, very good in long-duration
    assets is Bitcoin. You know, the opposite is Bitcoin.
  topic: Investment/Adoption
- impact_reason: Frames the crypto market (altcoins) as a massive, previously untapped
    pool of 'public liquid assets' that has absorbed capital that would have otherwise
    gone into traditional equities, explaining market dynamics.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I say, 'Yeah, you see a decline in public companies. I see an explosion of
    public liquid assets.' Because a whole generation went now that it's playing in
    the crypto world, it's not on your exchange, right? But we went from 8 to 4,000
    companies, but we got, you know, 20 million or whatever the number is now, coins
    of which 99 are nonsense, but there's a lot of capital—trillions of dollars now—that
    went and got diverted into these public liquid assets that otherwise would have
    gone into stocks or something like that.
  topic: Adoption/Investment
- impact_reason: This is a key insight arguing that crypto assets (despite their quality
    issues) are functionally replacing a portion of traditional public equity investment
    due to their liquidity and accessibility to a new generation.

    but there's a lot of capital—trillions of dollars now—that went and got diverted
    into these public liquid assets that otherwise would have gone into stocks or
    something like that.
  topic: Adoption/Investment
- impact_reason: This is a strong thesis linking crypto infrastructure directly to
    the future financing needs of small and growing businesses, bypassing traditional
    public markets, aligning with decentralized finance principles.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think crypto is the capital structure of the future for all of these little
    businesses, and they don't have to go through the concept of the public market,
    and that's what Michael Saylor talks about.
  topic: defi/investment
- impact_reason: Crucial data point highlighting that crypto adoption is globally
    distributed, with the majority of users residing outside the US, making Bitcoin's
    utility highly relevant in a weakening dollar environment for emerging markets.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And that's why for Bitcoin, it's incredibly powerful because you want—I mean,
    we're most of the users of crypto in the world are outside the US. The US does
    not dominate as a holder of crypto. That is dominated in terms of a number of
    users around the globe.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: Directly links the macro trend of dollar weakening to bullish outcomes
    for Bitcoin and emerging market assets.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So if you're going to have this transfer, I believe a weaker dollar is incredibly
    bullish for the crypto side, it's incredibly bullish for Bitcoin, and it's very,
    very positive for emerging markets.
  topic: investment
- impact_reason: 'This sets up the core thesis of the discussion: unusual option pricing
    in Bitcoin suggesting an asymmetric risk profile, which is a key insight for derivatives
    traders and crypto investors.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: As a derivatives person my whole life, one of the more interesting conversations
    I had with someone who I'll refer to on this podcast the same way I've referred
    to in Substack, I'll call them Dr. X. Okay, highlighted to me the asymmetry, the
    asymmetric pricing, or the strange pricing in Bitcoin calls versus puts.
  topic: Investment/DeFi
- impact_reason: Provides a concrete, striking example of the option skew (calls being
    disproportionately expensive relative to puts), indicating high implied volatility
    or demand for upside protection/speculation.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: just for example, with $100,000 as the price for spot Bitcoin out to September—so
    we're talking for months—a $30,000 out-of-the-money call was close to $5,000.
    Well, a put at $70,000 was close to $1,700.
  topic: Investment/DeFi
- impact_reason: Identifies a specific structural vulnerability (miners hedging production
    via short calls) that could trigger the predicted squeeze, drawing a parallel
    to historical commodity squeezes.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And the reason I think it is going to happen is because there's a lot of miners
    that seem to overwrite their calls. This is a production-related thing, and it
    reminds me of what happened to nickel in 2022 where we had this massive spike
    in nickel.
  topic: Investment/Technology
- impact_reason: Links MicroStrategy's financing activities (convert issuance) to
    increased gamma exposure and potential for asymmetric moves, a key technical driver.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Michael Saylor has done one thing to Bitcoin through the MicroStrategy convert
    market. He's brought a lot of short options out there in terms of people are now
    long a bunch. So there's gamma out there. So it's longer dated. All that means
    is we can get an asymmetric move, and then it will come back.
  topic: Investment/Strategy
- impact_reason: Quantifies the yield available through basis trading (selling futures
    premium), illustrating how traditional finance structures are being adapted to
    generate attractive, relatively safe returns on BTC holdings.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: if you buy spot Bitcoin and you sell the futures out front, you can get anywhere
    from 15 to 20%, depending on the time period. So I think this is allowing people
    through creativity to bring people into the market.
  topic: DeFi/Investment
- impact_reason: Directly links the observed weakening of the dollar to the speaker's
    core thesis about the end of its reserve status, providing context for potential
    investment shifts.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The dollar has not strengthened; the dollar has weakened. And as I talked
    about here, which I feel very strongly about, the global reserve currency function
    of the dollar is over.
  topic: Investment/Macro
- impact_reason: Identifies three distinct sources of future inflation (fiscal, currency,
    and energy/tech demand), creating a strong inflationary outlook that directly
    impacts asset allocation.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We're going to have inflationary pressures from the government, we're going
    to have inflationary pressures from the weaker dollar. I do believe that the AI
    situation is going to create power problems coming in the second half of the year...
  topic: Investment/Macro
- impact_reason: Highlights a major shift in institutional allocation away from illiquid,
    long-duration assets (like traditional VC/PE) due to rising rates and macro uncertainty.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I believe that long-duration assets—you saw that not only Harvard but all
    of the elite universities are talking about selling off their private equity and
    VC... I think we're going to get into a situation, as I've talked about here,
    where you don't want to be in long-duration assets.
  topic: Investment
- impact_reason: Predicts a structural renaissance for public markets over private
    markets, driven by macro policy and the need for liquidity, contradicting the
    last decade's trend.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I believe that because of the undisciplined monetary and fiscal policy stuff,
    because of the structural stuff that you're discussing, there is going to be a
    lot more opportunity in the public market versus the private market because there's
    this structural tailwind for liquid assets that are not these kind of illiquid,
    long-term type things.
  topic: Investment/Strategy
- impact_reason: 'Offers a high-level philosophical view of Web3/crypto''s role: not
    replacing fiat entirely, but forming a new, fragmented capital system underpinning
    the digital economy.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Bitcoin's not a currency, but the digital economy will be the economy. And
    that means stablecoins, it means Bitcoin. It's a fragmented thing, but it's just
    a different capital system, capital structure.
  topic: Web3 Vision/Adoption
- impact_reason: Expresses a lack of faith in the ability of both the administration
    and the Fed Chair (Powell) to manage the critical 10-year yield, suggesting policy
    impotence against macro forces.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I don't think they can control 10-year rates, and I don't think Powell is
    going to be able to help because of the inflationary pressures.
  topic: Regulation/Strategy
- impact_reason: Explicitly links the demographic shift away from private equity towards
    liquid assets (including crypto) as a fundamental tailwind for those liquid asset
    prices.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If an entire generation was very focused on privates, if that capital starts
    to now come into these kind of shorter-duration, more liquid type assets, that
    should serve as a tailwind for those asset prices.
  topic: Investment/Adoption
- impact_reason: 'Provides a framework for understanding the post-dollar world: it
    won''t be one currency, but a ''digital economy'' built on decentralized rails
    like Bitcoin and stablecoins.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The Callison brothers, they termed it as borderless financial services. So
    when people go, 'What's if the dollar's not the global reserve currency, what
    is it going to be?' I go, 'Well, Bitcoin's not a currency, but the digital economy
    will be the economy.'
  topic: Web3 Vision/Adoption
- impact_reason: This synthesizes two major viewpoints (AI/Startup growth vs. Bitcoin/Digital
    Assets) to define the emerging financial paradigm.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: So if you combine the Collison brothers, who are young, with Michael Saylor,
    who's not young, and you take those two presentations and you combine them, you're
    looking at the new capital structure.
  topic: strategy
- impact_reason: A strong warning that fiscal realities (inability to cut the deficit
    despite higher rates) force a return to inflationary concerns, contradicting hopes
    for immediate rate cuts.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is the biggest change is that if rates have moved higher, the dollar
    is weaker, and we weren't able to cut as much as the trillion dollars or two trillion
    that we hoped—I'm sorry, guys, but you have to go back to the inflationary playbook
    right now.
  topic: regulation/investment
- impact_reason: Provides a detailed argument for why a weaker US dollar is globally
    beneficial, specifically unlocking growth in emerging markets by easing their
    debt burdens and currency pressures.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And that's why in the end, the globe, seven billion people, are going to benefit
    from the dollar weakening. And I just want to make sure people understand this
    because I've said it and I haven't given an example. When I left—when I was in
    Brazil, the exchange rate was one-to-one versus the real... When the currency
    weakens, inflation pressure, they can't cut rates. So in countries like emerging
    markets, if the dollar is stronger—I mean, if the dollar is weaker now finally
    and it gives up its overvaluation, it's good for the Midwest, but it's also good
    for Brazil, it's good for these other countries that have been under pressure,
    which means the globe actually—a weaker dollar unleashes growth.
  topic: investment/adoption
- impact_reason: Contrasts the US dominance in traditional equity markets (70%+ market
    cap) with its relatively small share of global crypto users (15-20%), underscoring
    the decentralized nature of crypto adoption.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We might have the most dollars in there, but in terms of the usage, I think
    I forgot the last numbers, but it's no more than 15 to 20% is US in terms of the
    users. We're 70-something percent of the market cap of stocks.
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: A strong philosophical statement defining Bitcoin's unique asset
    class status, which underpins the potential for asymmetric moves not seen in traditional
    assets.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: One of my beliefs overall has been that Bitcoin is not a currency, it's not
    an equity. So when people call it a risk asset or they call it a currency, I'm
    like, it's not that. It's kind of a hybrid thing. It has a finite amount, and
    this is what's different with the fiat thing.
  topic: Strategy/Adoption
- impact_reason: Predicts extreme volatility and violence in the move if a squeeze
    occurs, appealing to retail sentiment and community dynamics often seen in highly
    shorted assets.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think Bitcoin fits in with these kinds [like GameStop]... I think it can
    get extremely violent. Now, once it's done, you'll get a pullback, obviously,
    but at some point here, I think you're going to get a big move.
  topic: Investment
- impact_reason: 'Reiterates the core investment thesis shift: the current environment
    favors positioning for massive upside rather than hedging against downside risk.'
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And again, it gets into you have to be more worried about an asymmetric upside
    than downside in this. Everyone has always been more worried about the asymmetric
    downside. I think what these products are doing is taking advantage of the asymmetric
    pricing that's up there.
  topic: Investment/Strategy
- impact_reason: Provides a counter-intuitive explanation for rising global liquidity,
    attributing it to dollar weakness rather than purely central bank action, which
    has implications for risk assets.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This is unleashing growth. This is why when you see these charts of global
    liquidity going higher, the reason global liquidity is going higher is because
    the dollar is weakening, and you're getting these countries that weren't stimulating
    to stimulate, like China and Germany.
  topic: Investment/Macro
- impact_reason: Draws a direct analogy between the rapid adoption/churn in AI tools
    and the crypto landscape, suggesting that utility and superior alternatives drive
    long-term success in both digital sectors.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What they are basically saying about the retention is that people use AI as
    a tool, but then they're like, 'Oh, there's a better tool.' That's exactly the
    way I describe it to people [about crypto coins].
  topic: Technology/Adoption
- impact_reason: Highlights a specific policy expectation (falling long-term rates)
    that has failed to materialize, reinforcing the speaker's bearish view on long-term
    bonds and bullish view on rates.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The other thing Scott Bessent mentioned at his Senate confirmation was that
    rates were going to come down on the long end. That has not happened. We're at

    they go higher.

    demands of the AI buildout, a forward-looking technological risk.

    in the second half of the year, even though Spain's situation that went on may
    not be directly related to AI.

    bullish signal for energy prices, which has major implications for inflation.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I use those kind of reversal signs on what should be theoretically the kind
    of news that would make you go lower as a sign that we may have seen the low in

    an enabler for the creator economy, which often leverages Web3 tools for monetization.

  text: I still think the reality is we'll probably get to new all-time highs this
    year. But because I think rates are going higher and I think inflation is going
    higher, I wouldn't be—if we get any rate cuts this year, I believe it'll be one.

    tariffs, setting up the speaker's argument that inflation will be higher than
    anticipated.

  text: The problem is when he was asked the question, 'Well, isn't this going to
    be inflationary?' He said, 'Not very.' So if we have 10% tariffs, the companies
    will eat 4%, the dollar will strengthen by 4%, and that'll leave 2% left for individuals

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: #1546 Jordi Visser | Bitcoin’s Price Is About
  to SHOCK Everyone - Here’s Why


  This episode of the Pomp Podcast features Anthony Pompliano interviewing Jordy Visser,
  a Wall Street veteran with 30 years of experience, who presents a compelling, contrarian
  case for significant upside in Bitcoin, primarily driven by derivatives market dynamics
  and a shifting global macro environment.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus areas are **Bitcoin derivatives (options market structure), potential
  short squeezes in Bitcoin and commodities, global macroeconomics (dollar weakness,
  inflation, tariffs), and the structural shift in asset allocation away from long-duration
  private assets toward liquid assets, including Bitcoin.**


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Asymmetric Option Pricing:** Visser highlights a significant skew in the Bitcoin
  options market (observed on Deribit), where out-of-the-money calls are priced disproportionately
  high relative to puts. This suggests a high implied volatility expectation for upward
  moves or a large number of short call positions being written.

  *   **Premium on Futures/Calls:** The fact that Bitcoin futures and options are
  trading at a significant premium to the spot price (annualized rates exceeding the
  Fed Funds rate) incentivizes selling options, potentially setting up a gamma squeeze
  scenario if the price moves rapidly upward.

  *   **Miners Overwriting Calls:** Visser suggests that miners are actively selling
  calls against their production, similar to hedging strategies seen in traditional
  commodities, which could force them to cover short positions violently during a
  price spike, triggering a squeeze.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Imminent Short Squeeze:** Visser strongly predicts a violent, asymmetric short
  squeeze in Bitcoin later this year, fueled by the options market structure and community
  belief that shorts are trapped.

  *   **Dollar Weakness and Inflationary Pressures:** The weakening US Dollar, which
  Visser believes signals the end of its global reserve currency status, combined
  with worsening budget deficits and potential AI-driven power constraints, suggests
  rising inflationary pressures in the second half of the year.

  *   **Shift from Long-Duration Assets:** Due to rising nominal GDP and the potential
  for 10-year Treasury yields to move higher (contrary to expectations), long-duration
  assets (VC, private equity, tech stocks) are structurally disadvantaged. Bitcoin,
  being the opposite of a long-duration asset, stands to benefit from this capital
  reallocation.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jordy Visser:** The guest, a 30-year Wall Street veteran, provides the core
  thesis based on derivatives analysis.

  *   **Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy):** Mentioned for his role in bringing short
  options/gamma into the market via MicroStrategy convertibles, which contributes
  to the potential for asymmetric moves.

  *   **Scott Bessent:** His comments regarding 10% tariffs and the expectation that
  the dollar would strengthen were cited as a key macro indicator that has proven
  incorrect (the dollar has weakened).

  *   **Stripe (Callison Brothers):** Their keynote highlighting the rapid growth
  of AI/SaaS companies and the concept of "borderless financial services" was referenced
  as evidence of a changing digital economy structure.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Tariffs and Inflation:** The discussion touched upon the potential for 10%
  tariffs, noting that the market reaction (dollar weakening instead of strengthening)
  suggests fiscal/monetary policy is losing control over key economic variables.

  *   **Government Control Over Rates:** Visser expressed skepticism that the current
  administration or the Fed (Powell) can control the long-term interest rates (specifically
  the 10-year yield) due to underlying inflationary pressures.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation points toward a regime change where **liquid assets, particularly
  Bitcoin, will outperform illiquid, long-duration private assets.** The weakening
  dollar and potential resurgence of inflation will force institutional capital (endowments,
  funds) to reallocate away from private equity and into shorter-duration, more liquid
  assets like public equities and Bitcoin. Bitcoin is positioned as a key beneficiary
  of this structural shift.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **crypto investors, macro hedge fund managers,
  derivatives traders, and institutional allocators** who need sophisticated analysis
  on the intersection of derivatives pricing, macro trends, and digital asset valuation.'
