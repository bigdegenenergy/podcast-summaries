    had kind of moved into these equity vehicles, and we also saw Robinhood, not Coinbase,

    nascent, some of the retail investors mispricing these assets to truly crazy premiums
    to NAV before these investors were becoming unlocked, and then gravity just sort
    of doing its thing when the unlocks came through.

    whose quick unlock schedules create predictable sell pressure, contrasting with
    long-term alignment.
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What we're talking about in terms of the unlocks, that's actually a very important
    point because it really depends on how you define or how you put together your
    shareholder base. So in a lot of these cases, the PIPE investors are hedge funds
    playing a short-term game, and so they're investing, and then they're going to
    be unlocked in 30 days, 60 days, 90 days.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Which Types of Crypto Assets Make for Good Treasury
  Companies? - Ep. 885


  This episode of Unchained, featuring Guy Young (Founder of Athena Labs) and Rob
  Hader (General Partner at Dragonfly), dives deep into the emerging trend of **corporate
  treasury vehicles** structured through traditional finance (TradFi) wrappers, specifically
  focusing on the SPAC merger involving Athena Labs and TLGY Acquisition Corp. to
  form **Stablecoin X Assets**.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the strategic rationale, structure, and investment thesis behind
  using public market vehicles (like SPACs/PIPEs) to provide **TradFi investors access
  to specific, high-growth crypto-native businesses and digital assets**, particularly
  stablecoins and infrastructure plays, rather than just Bitcoin or Ethereum ETFs.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Distinction in Access:** The conversation highlights that while Bitcoin and
  Ethereum have established ETF access, other valuable crypto primitives (like high-growth
  protocols such as Athena) lack efficient public market entry points for institutional
  capital.

  *   **Product Differentiation:** The key technical/structural difference between
  vehicles like MSTR (MicroStrategy) and a stablecoin treasury vehicle is the reliance
  on **financial alchemy (leverage)** versus **access and distribution**. MSTR uses
  debt to create leverage on BTC; stablecoin treasuries aim to distribute exposure
  to a specific narrative (digital dollars).

  *   **Vaporware vs. Real Business:** A strong emphasis is placed on avoiding wrapping
  "vaporware" in an equity structure. Sustainable vehicles must represent real businesses
  generating real revenue, mirroring the "Mag 7" phenomenon in traditional equities.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Rejection of Premium to NAV:** Both guests explicitly state they are **not**
  interested in vehicles that trade at a significant premium to Net Asset Value (NAV).
  The purpose of these structures is access and distribution, not financial engineering
  based on inflated premiums.

  *   **The Need for Connective Tissue:** The thesis posits that for the crypto segment
  (currently ~$1T in altcoin market cap) to grow to $3T-$10T, robust "connective tissue"
  must be established between these digital assets and the massive pools of capital
  in TradFi equity markets.

  *   **Dispersion and Maturation:** The market is maturing, leading to dispersion.
  Assets with real cash flows (like Athena or Hyperliquid) will decouple and compound
  as winners, similar to the Mag 7 in equities, while projects lacking product-market
  fit will struggle.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Athena Labs:** The crypto-native business seeking public market access via
  the SPAC merger.

  *   **Stablecoin X Assets:** The resulting entity, intended to function as a validator
  and infrastructure business supporting the Athena ecosystem.

  *   **MicroStrategy (MSTR):** Used as the primary case study for a **financial alchemy**
  vehicle, leveraging debt to increase BTC exposure per share, appealing to sophisticated
  hedge funds and investors comfortable with complex capital structures.

  *   **Circle:** Mentioned as a key player whose IPO signaled the clear demand for
  digital dollar exposure.

  *   **Vanguard:** Ironically noted as a major holder of MSTR, despite the firm''s
  historical bearishness on Bitcoin and refusal to offer Bitcoin ETFs to its clients.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  While not a deep dive into specific regulation, the discussion implies that TradFi
  wrappers (SPACs, public equity) are being utilized precisely because they offer
  a familiar, regulated structure (share registers, established custodians like State
  Street) that large pensions and sovereign wealth funds are more comfortable with
  than direct crypto custody.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is moving toward a **bifurcation**:

  1.  **Sophisticated, Revenue-Generating Protocols:** These will attract institutional
  capital through various equity structures, leading to compounding growth (the "crypto
  Mag 7").

  2.  **Vaporware/Hype Projects:** These will be left behind, as the era of easy capital
  based purely on "hopes and dreams" is ending. Founders are advised to focus on building
  utility first, then tokenizing.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto/Web3 Strategists, Institutional Investors, Venture Capitalists, and Corporate
  Finance Professionals** interested in the intersection of digital asset infrastructure
  and public market capital formation.


  ---


  ### Comprehensive Narrative Arc


  The episode centers on the strategic shift from purely token-based fundraising to
  utilizing public equity wrappers to bridge the gap between crypto innovation and
  TradFi capital pools. Guy Young explains that Athena chose this path because the
  demand for stablecoin and infrastructure exposure among TradFi investors far outstrips
  the current supply of investable vehicles. He strongly contrasts this with the MSTR
  model, arguing that while MSTR is a successful "financial alchemy" play built on
  leverage for Bitcoin, vehicles for newer assets should focus on **access and distribution**
  rather than leveraging debt, especially given the volatility of altcoins.


  Rob Hader reinforces this from the venture perspective, noting Dragonfly’s focus
  on protocols where direct access is difficult. He details how different institutional
  mandates lead investors to choose different capital structures: ETFs for simple
  BTC/ETH exposure (with custody comfort), MSTR for leveraged BTC exposure appealing
  to hedge funds (via converts/debt), and protocol-specific vehicles (like Stablecoin
  X) for exposure to high-growth, utility-focused businesses.


  A key theme is the **maturation of the crypto market**. Both speakers agree that
  the speculative frenzy of 2021 is over. The market is now demanding fundamental
  underwriting, leading to greater dispersion. They explicitly condemn wrapping poor
  business models ("vaporware") in equity wrappers, asserting that only assets with
  real revenue and utility will survive and compound'
