summary: '## Summary of AI and Business Podcast Episode: AI in Auditing Workflows
  with Nathaniel Bell


  This episode of the AI and Business Podcast, featuring Nathaniel Bell, Data Management
  Director at Wells Fargo, focuses on the practical application of AIâ€”particularly
  deterministic and foundational modelsâ€”in reshaping traditional enterprise auditing
  workflows within the financial sector. The discussion bridges the gap between advanced
  AI concepts (like agentic AI discussed previously) and immediate, high-impact automation
  opportunities.


  Here are the key takeaways for technology professionals:


  **1. Main Narrative Arc & Key Discussion Points:**

  The conversation centers on how AI, even simple, rules-based systems, can significantly
  enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of auditing, moving processes from manual
  and reactive toward continuous monitoring. The core challenge discussed is balancing
  technological innovation with the inherent caution and regulatory demands of the
  financial industry.


  **2. Major Topics and Subject Areas Covered:**

  *   **AI in Auditing:** Reshaping workflows, identifying and addressing risk more
  efficiently.

  *   **Workflow Stages:** Information gathering, control testing, and moving toward
  continuous auditing.

  *   **Data Quality:** The critical prerequisite for achieving continuous monitoring.

  *   **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity:** How digital transformation and codified processes
  reduce human subjectivity in risk assessment.

  *   **Team Assembly:** The necessary skill sets for modern audit teams navigating
  digital transformation.


  **3. Technical Concepts, Methodologies, or Frameworks Discussed:**

  *   **Deterministic AI:** Highlighted as the easiest and most immediate form of
  AI deployment for rules-based auditing tasks.

  *   **Generative AI (LLMs):** Suggested for accelerating the initial, time-consuming
  information-gathering phase (e.g., querying models to describe a service or identify
  key risks).

  *   **Agentic AI:** Briefly referenced as a more advanced future state, contrasting
  with the immediate focus on simpler deployments.

  *   **Continuous Auditing:** The end goal for proactive risk management, contingent
  upon high-quality, connected data streams.


  **4. Business Implications and Strategic Insights:**

  *   **High ROI on Manual Processes:** Nathaniel strongly advises targeting **highly
  manual processes** first, as they offer the biggest "pain for the buck" and are
  prone to human error (noting that even complex spreadsheet checks only catch about
  70% of errors).

  *   **Codifying Processes:** Digital transformation, especially with AI integration,
  forces the codification of processes, leading to more objective risk assessments,
  which is a strategic advantage in regulated environments.

  *   **Efficiency vs. Depth:** Automation in data gathering frees auditors to focus
  on higher-value activities like **storytelling, systemic risk assessment, and strategic
  observation rating** rather than tracking individual anomalies.


  **5. Key Personalities and Experts Mentioned:**

  *   **Nathaniel Bell (Data Management Director, Wells Fargo):** The expert guest,
  providing practical insights from his experience in audit and data management, including
  a past background in the risk-averse nuclear industry.

  *   **Matthew Damello (Editorial Director, Emerge AI Research):** The host, framing
  the discussion and drawing parallels to other subjective fields like transfer pricing
  and clinical trials.


  **6. Predictions, Trends, or Future-Looking Statements:**

  *   The shift from manual/reactive auditing to **continuous/proactive auditing**
  is inevitable, driven by data connectivity.

  *   The role of the human auditor will evolve to focus on interpreting patterns
  identified by AI, validating systemic gaps, and providing subjective risk ratings
  based on broader context.


  **7. Practical Applications and Real-World Examples:**

  *   Using LLMs to quickly **summarize complex service descriptions** and identify
  necessary controls, replacing time-consuming meetings with multiple stakeholders.

  *   Applying deterministic models to **test controls** based on established rules,
  immediately flagging gaps.


  **8. Controversies, Challenges, or Problems Highlighted:**

  *   **Data Quality Dependency:** Continuous monitoring is impossible without accurate,
  complete, and well-controlled data flowing directly from source systems.

  *   **Organizational Comfort:** There is an emotional or comfort-based resistance
  to moving away from familiar, manual processes (like Excel sheets) toward continuous
  monitoring systems.

  *   **Complexity for Auditors:** As processes become more digital and codified,
  auditors must develop skills to examine the underlying code and transformation logic,
  increasing complexity.


  **9. Solutions, Recommendations, or Actionable Advice Provided:**

  *   **Start Simple:** Focus initial AI deployments on deterministic, rules-based
  use cases within highly manual phases for immediate effectiveness gains.

  *   **Prioritize Data Connectivity:** Audit leaders must focus on building reliable
  data pipelines from source systems to enable any form of continuous monitoring.

  *   **Embrace Transformation:** Automating manual tasks will inherently lead to
  process improvement and allow teams to focus on high-level strategic risk assessment
  and storytelling.


  **10. Context About Why This Conversation Matters to the Industry:**

  This conversation is crucial because it grounds the discussion of enterprise AI
  in the highly regulated and risk-averse financial services sector. It provides a
  roadmap for audit and compliance professionals to adopt AI incrementally, proving
  ROI with deterministic tools before attempting large-scale generative or agentic
  overhauls, thereby ensuring regulatory compliance while driving efficiency.'
