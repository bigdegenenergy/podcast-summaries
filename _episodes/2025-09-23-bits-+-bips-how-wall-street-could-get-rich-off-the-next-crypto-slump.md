  extracted: shift topics but there's one one concluding thought on this is you can
    pay for data like real time retail spend on visa mastercard networks and hedge
    funds like two sigma pay for that to get an early read on which retailers are
    going to perform or underperform you think about like what stable coins mean and
    being really maybe tag that to different merchant IDs things start to get pretty
    interesting in terms of you know democratizing access to that information compilianly
    there's more so sort out there yeah uh or good I was just gonna say I'm before
    we move on and I have to take a quick break for ads I just want to to tie bill
    in this discussion because we were talking about markets I mean maybe um for for
    ramen and Vinny just quickly what do you think the next week looks like uh this
    this Bitcoin and market to need to go down are we're gonna see a slight bump like
    what are what are you seeing especially given that this is a bit of a holiday
    week for I've got a bunch of put positions in place um Bitcoin theory in particular
    uh I'm a bit bearish right now I mean I was bearish basically going into the FOMC
    because I don't think they should have cut and I think that cutting has signaled
    weakness and I think it causes problems with with um Japan in particular and we're
    seeing you know if we saw immediately what happened afterwards within the K and
    I think I mean this is again the macro situation is is a very complex one so I'm
    trying to discuss it in a short session like this doesn't make any sense um but
    I think that we're we're um we're gonna see a lot of liquidity unwind from the
    system and I think that even though we're seeing stocks go up right now um yeah
    I have I have virtually zero stocks in my portfolio of public stocks I like I'm
    basically in Treasury short term um and some gold positions you're always in Treasury's
    and gold uh come on sorry you're always in Treasury's and gold right you know
    you you know recently yeah yeah yeah yeah I mean I'm run a big fan of stocks I
    think stocks are really over about it I think the Buffett indicators you know
    no I'll take the other side of that all day long yeah I just want to find out
    I recently invested in some gold too for people who can't see this is an Eagles
    championship super following nice just to be clear it is not actually a real one
    made of gold my wife would divorce me but I think like on Bitcoin I think if you
    ever guess to 107 the next week or two you're supposed to be a buyer so at 110
    you get to be a buyer to somewhere around those levels right now it's kind of
    in a lukewarm uh position you know I I go back to some of those negative seasonal
    uh issues we've talked about a few minutes ago but I I wouldn't be as bearish
    I think you should have a run up through November uh but you got to be day to
    day on this if you're timing the entry at that level you got to be day to day
    on it you got to sit on it like I can't tell you now it's kind of in Thursday
    but if you tell me what happens on Wednesday I'll give you a view if that makes
    sense yeah I I would also hop in here and say I think for people who are more
    concerned about real returns which is probably where Vinnie is as opposed to purely
    nominal or maybe you're not dollar denominated as well I think one of the few
    assets in the current market that you could buy and just fire and forget for a
    while probably is gold right rom to your point of like I don't think you need
    to tactically trade gold because that's one where if we continue spending this
    amount of money on a long enough time frame that thing is definitely going up
    I agree the gold is uh I'd say a primary position for me right now um because
    I think it's all about protecting privacy and power and I think that the the the
    US is running a twin deficit the federal deficit is going to keep rising I mean
    we're going to be 2

  type: recommendation
- actionable: true
  confidence: medium
  extracted: you know bring on someone that's looked at the entire industry our debt
    stack and take it right now the argument is it's in five years from now all three
    years from now so it doesn't matter right now I'm like not I don't think so we
    go see a lot more your differential crash of crisis general idea is correct like
    there's this concept called a minsky hypothesis uh developed by high minsky it's
    an extraordinary framework I see it has not been uh awesome if any of there but
    I'll add up briefly so the concept is that at the beginning of a of a market run
    you underwrite assets to free cash flow the unleavored free cash flow is enough
    to motivate a purchase maybe that's 8% 12% 14% then as the market gets going that
    assets priced higher the yield is lower to get to your target return use a to
    use some leverage okay so now you say oh I can get to my 8% bogey 12 or 14% but
    I've added leverage to the system and obviously we've seen a levering of assets
    including micro strategy and then what happens in phase three it's comparable
    based analysis that means you say oh you should buy it because the public compass
    60 times earnings therefore it's a bargain because this is at 42 earnings so that's
    actually a form of greater full theory you're betting that there's some marginal
    buyer who's a sucker that's going to buy and so Vinnie's point is that some of
    these assets are transitioning from phase two to phase three because they're kicking
    out the can to the future and there's going to be some buyer in the future the
    problem is that it's all reflexive there is a buyer in the future if it keeps
    going up but if it doesn't keep going up then there's no buyer in the future you
    can't presume that well I was going to say you've kind of hit on the problem with
    dats trading and an mdav premium right like this is the sort of tail of the minskite
    theory is that like if you list without being overly like mean here if you listen
    to most people like trying to explain why their dachshund traded an mdav premium
    it's a version of the old joke and mathematics of part one a miracle happens part
    two right that's like guys right that's you know it's it's like explain to me
    how using leverage causes your underlying asset to become more valuable over time
    right like you could buy more of it I get that that's how leverage works total
    cool totally good but like say more and they just can't so to me part of part
    of why I've been skeptical of most of the dats and again there's some set like
    a very handful of dats with things like operating cash flow okay maybe you're
    going to work but for anybody who's in the asset part that's trading at a premium
    you're in the final phase of minskie already and we all know high grades I agree
    you're reminding me of the old joke about the economist on an island with the
    can of soup and then someone asked the economist how you gonna get off the island
    well assume a assume a can opener that's what you're saying like assume 10x if
    we get the 10x we're going to 20x and aren't we going to 10x we'll look at mstl
    here I like I just want to ask because I know we're going to get some questions
    the new listing standards from the SEC to sort of standardize cut down the timeline
    from I think down to as little 75 days to to listen to spot ETFs how does that
    impact the calculus for all of this especially especially for some of the longer
    tail assets that maybe don't have dats and I know in some cases dats were formed
    strictly because of that regulatory arbitrage that I think Austin you were talking
    about before so Austin maybe just come to you what are your thoughts well my thoughts
    are that I'm on mute um your your cause like be pain is so I should get a good
    rum or anything yeah go go to rum I want to think about how I'm gonna focus on
    it I stumped Austin that doesn't happen very often I like it I'm trying that to
    be rude I have no views on this all right fast forward okay well I Austin seems
    like she has something that he wants to say so I mean just for me I mean I think
    it just for like just the buy-offs a little bit of time it kind of closes off
    the window to some of these I mean I've seen some dats like I think one was for
    for Fed the artificial intelligence company that like a company called interactive
    strength through a hell mirror and try to convert themselves into one of those
    and I don't see any any interest in like like real liquidity for any of those
    types of tokens and I don't see much hope of any of this tokens re-emerging from
    the dead which is but I think a lot of those are doing so unless you catch one
    of these shooting stars right on the way up at the perfect time be an ETF or a
    debt I don't see a lot of hope but Austin but let me let me actually go one step
    like further to explain why I paused there the dad thing fundamentally is like
    a funding complex trade in general right because the whole idea is like I'm gonna
    start with some initial amount of money either in a shell company through a SPAC
    something like that I'm gonna lay around additional money usually in the form
    of a pipe or something like that and a lot of that is sometimes in kind contributions
    from people who are doing it for tax reasons and then to be able to borrow against
    stuff for these so is there an ability to get certain things rolling purely on
    a tax our basis that will inevitably decay back down to zero like yeah that can
    totally keep happening like I think you've kind of endlessly throw like ice cubes
    into the boiling water not increasingly dumb and weird stuff in that regard the
    separate question is do you have any staying power with any of these I will jokingly
    give the answer that I was contemplating how to wrap my head around which is actually
    the thing we should be launching is a debt that unwinds other debts well now I
    actually think I think I think what actually wants to happening is the debts with
    the highest M-node multiple will be able to gobble up the smaller ones right so
    it's basically Pac-Man for debts and so but but that only happens with the debts
    that are highly the very capital efficient you know it's for example that takes
    a lot right if you're running a slotted debt and you can manage the amount of
    capital you have cash on hand a amount of soul that you have this you stake this
    all appropriately you use the soul in the way that you know within defy that makes
    sense and you can generate an above market return on that and then you have a
    soul debt that has no idea what they're doing and they're just maybe they're just
    staking bluntly and they're they're highly leveraged and they borrowed soul instead
    of whatever else and market shanks all of a sudden that one's heavily undervalued
    and the one that's responsibly managed isn't and because they're more efficient
    with the capital they can gobble up the smaller one so I don't think I mean I
    think if we look at the capital markets within crypto for the highly liquid stuff
    the Solana is a theorem Bitcoin etc as long as the capital is managed correctly
    I think you you do get this other trash up of uni however however I will say that
    the stuff is still priced in dollars right everything trades to the dollar and
    so any down draft in the prices will create pressure on these assets I feel like
    that's still the minskie problem though right like assume a debt that trades at
    an MNAM premium and I'm just like again I I remain skeptical then in the long
    run any of the debts traded at MNAM you should only be trading at a premium to
    your assets if you have cash flow generation above and beyond right what would
    be expected and I will also remind everybody in fact I'm working on a paper about
    this that with the ETF listing standards we're going to have staking inside of
    the ETFs now so this whole problem of oh my ETF is a melting ice cube and the
    data is not as also about to go away and in fact I think you're going to start
    seeing things like liquid staking tokens inside ETFs to get the best of both worlds
    in it suddenly becomes very hard for me to figure out how if a dad's not going
    to be buying real cash flowing businesses what the hell it's doing existing it's
    a great question so well also I would I would say this I would disagree here I
    would say I think you can have debts that are higher beta to the underlying spot
    and if you're in a bull market then they'll have an MNAMV ratio greater than one
    if you're in a bear market will be less than one because to Vinnie's point they've
    got some debt outstanding but I don't think there's anything same that they can't
    have a premium then if you get if you've got cheap debt well I agree with Austin
    yeah I think that some of these debts will have to buy operating companies like
    you know if you're doing a Salana debt you want to maybe buy a you know a validate
    or set one up or you know that's the thing so there's businesses that these debts
    can all own to help juice their returns it just depends on how vibrant and how
    stable the ecosystem is for that for that particular crypto so that's why I'm
    pretty bearish on the long tail of cryptos out there because most of them are
    very illiquid very small market cap don't have established sort of economies that
    have been functioned there but it's very clear Bitcoin Ethereum Salana has yes
    I agree with that yeah so we have about a little less than five minutes ROM is
    you know and Austin Vinnie used to you I like to end by just asking everyone to
    share just one kind of contrarian thought or just something from this discussion
    that was left on the cutting board so so final thoughts ROM why don't we go to
    you first yeah so like the total return the S&P crushes gold that's one so I could
    actually check that with GROC if you do equal weight it's different but why are
    you doing equal weight you gotta do market cap weight all right all right equal
    weight is you know equal weight is not a market basket right but you know you're
    adding to winners trimming losers and market weight two is by the way my last
    call on the show I think is last week and I also rated six weeks ago is better
    mortgage that's up 57% today up 300% of the last few months but that's been phenomenal
    not financial advice entertainment only I think no wage and cruise lines is quite
    interesting here it's got strong EPS growth or Trenekuides 90% plus they've got
    debt but the bulk of that is customer advances those are customers saying here's
    my money that's called a negative cash conversion cycle by like here's my money
    so I can pay can I use your cruise in the future that's what you want so I like
    I like that concept betting on boomers betting on travel travel and leisure betting
    on consumer discretionary boomers want to stretch more and more retiring past
    peak employment and it comes favorably to their peer group in terms of valuation
    like royal crib and then carnival cruise lines so that's my Norwegian cruise lines
    nice I'll hop in here because mine actually piles on in a different direction
    from what Rama is saying which is I would tell you if we are going to have a breakdown
    in the economy I don't think it's going to be driven in the traditional way that
    people in the United States are used to and what I mean by that is the US experience
    if you look at financial data in this country over the past I don't know 50 years
    more what we've had is a growing young population relative to the elderly population
    are at least stable with a growing working age population is more and more people
    piled into the workforce and we are now on the reversal of the trend of that so
    if we're going to start seeing sort of unwinds in these sorts of things it's going
    to look more like the experience in Asia of the past few decades not as extreme
    but go look at somewhere like Japan because his economy essentially becomes older
    and older and older over time you start to have a total reallocation of where
    efforts go and one you would expect things like cruise lines nursing homes like
    funeral homes to outperform because essentially you're going to be delivering
    more services to a greater population share but two you start to have in a place
    like the US intergenerational warfare and to me if we're going to have a breakdown
    my point to people is it's not going to look the way you think so also please
    please please stop overfitting with past models from the United States
  text: we should you know bring on someone that's looked at the entire industry our
    debt stack and take it right now the argument is it's in five years from now all
    three years from now so it doesn't matter right now I'm like not I don't think
    so we go see a lot more your differential crash of crisis general idea is correct

    run you underwrite assets to free cash flow the unleavored free cash flow is enough
    to motivate a purchase maybe that's 8% 12% 14% then as the market gets going that
    assets priced higher the yield is lower to get to your target return use a to
    use some leverage okay so now you say oh I can get to my 8% bogey 12 or 14% but
    I've added leverage to the system and obviously we've seen a levering of assets
    including micro strategy and then what happens in phase three it's comparable
    based analysis that means you say oh you should buy it because the public compass
    60 times earnings therefore it's a bargain because this is at 42 earnings so that's
    actually a form of greater full theory you're betting that there's some marginal
    buyer who's a sucker that's going to buy and so Vinnie's point is that some of
    these assets are transitioning from phase two to phase three because they're kicking
    out the can to the future and there's going to be some buyer in the future the
    problem is that it's all reflexive there is a buyer in the future if it keeps
    going up but if it doesn't keep going up then there's no buyer in the future you
    can't presume that well I was going to say you've kind of hit on the problem with
    dats trading and an mdav premium right like this is the sort of tail of the minskite
    theory is that like if you list without being overly like mean here if you listen
    to most people like trying to explain why their dachshund traded an mdav premium
    it's a version of the old joke and mathematics of part one a miracle happens part
    two right that's like guys right that's you know it's it's like explain to me
    how using leverage causes your underlying asset to become more valuable over time
    right like you could buy more of it I get that that's how leverage works total
    cool totally good but like say more and they just can't so to me part of part
    of why I've been skeptical of most of the dats and again there's some set like
    a very handful of dats with things like operating cash flow okay maybe you're
    going to work but for anybody who's in the asset part that's trading at a premium
    you're in the final phase of minskie already and we all know high grades I agree
    you're reminding me of the old joke about the economist on an island with the
    can of soup and then someone asked the economist how you gonna get off the island
    well assume a assume a can opener that's what you're saying like assume 10x if
    we get the 10x we're going to 20x and aren't we going to 10x we'll look at mstl
    here I like I just want to ask because I know we're going to get some questions
    the new listing standards from the SEC to sort of standardize cut down the timeline
    from I think down to as little 75 days to to listen to spot ETFs how does that
    impact the calculus for all of this especially especially for some of the longer
    tail assets that maybe don't have dats and I know in some cases dats were formed
    strictly because of that regulatory arbitrage that I think Austin you were talking
    about before so Austin maybe just come to you what are your thoughts well my thoughts
    are that I'm on mute um your your cause like be pain is so I should get a good
    rum or anything yeah go go to rum I want to think about how I'm gonna focus on
    it I stumped Austin that doesn't happen very often I like it I'm trying that to
    be rude I have no views on this all right fast forward okay well I Austin seems
    like she has something that he wants to say so I mean just for me I mean I think
    it just for like just the buy-offs a little bit of time it kind of closes off
    the window to some of these I mean I've seen some dats like I think one was for
    for Fed the artificial intelligence company that like a company called interactive
    strength through a hell mirror and try to convert themselves into one of those
    and I don't see any any interest in like like real liquidity for any of those
    types of tokens and I don't see much hope of any of this tokens re-emerging from
    the dead which is but I think a lot of those are doing so unless you catch one
    of these shooting stars right on the way up at the perfect time be an ETF or a
    debt I don't see a lot of hope but Austin but let me let me actually go one step
    like further to explain why I paused there the dad thing fundamentally is like
    a funding complex trade in general right because the whole idea is like I'm gonna
    start with some initial amount of money either in a shell company through a SPAC
    something like that I'm gonna lay around additional money usually in the form
    of a pipe or something like that and a lot of that is sometimes in kind contributions
    from people who are doing it for tax reasons and then to be able to borrow against
    stuff for these so is there an ability to get certain things rolling purely on
    a tax our basis that will inevitably decay back down to zero like yeah that can
    totally keep happening like I think you've kind of endlessly throw like ice cubes
    into the boiling water not increasingly dumb and weird stuff in that regard the
    separate question is do you have any staying power with any of these I will jokingly
    give the answer that I was contemplating how to wrap my head around which is actually
    the thing we should be launching is a debt that unwinds other debts well now I
    actually think I think I think what actually wants to happening is the debts with
    the highest M-node multiple will be able to gobble up the smaller ones right so
    it's basically Pac-Man for debts and so but but that only happens with the debts
    that are highly the very capital efficient you know it's for example that takes
    a lot right if you're running a slotted debt and you can manage the amount of
    capital you have cash on hand a amount of soul that you have this you stake this
    all appropriately you use the soul in the way that you know within defy that makes
    sense and you can generate an above market return on that and then you have a
    soul debt that has no idea what they're doing and they're just maybe they're just
    staking bluntly and they're they're highly leveraged and they borrowed soul instead
    of whatever else and market shanks all of a sudden that one's heavily undervalued
    and the one that's responsibly managed isn't and because they're more efficient
    with the capital they can gobble up the smaller one so I don't think I mean I
    think if we look at the capital markets within crypto for the highly liquid stuff
    the Solana is a theorem Bitcoin etc as long as the capital is managed correctly
    I think you you do get this other trash up of uni however however I will say that
    the stuff is still priced in dollars right everything trades to the dollar and
    so any down draft in the prices will create pressure on these assets I feel like
    that's still the minskie problem though right like assume a debt that trades at
    an MNAM premium and I'm just like again I I remain skeptical then in the long
    run any of the debts traded at MNAM you should only be trading at a premium to
    your assets if you have cash flow generation above and beyond right what would
    be expected and I will also remind everybody in fact I'm working on a paper about
    this that with the ETF listing standards we're going to have staking inside of
    the ETFs now so this whole problem of oh my ETF is a melting ice cube and the
    data is not as also about to go away and in fact I think you're going to start
    seeing things like liquid staking tokens inside ETFs to get the best of both worlds
    in it suddenly becomes very hard for me to figure out how if a dad's not going
    to be buying real cash flowing businesses what the hell it's doing existing it's
    a great question so well also I would I would say this I would disagree here I
    would say I think you can have debts that are higher beta to the underlying spot
    and if you're in a bull market then they'll have an MNAMV ratio greater than one
    if you're in a bear market will be less than one because to Vinnie's point they've
    got some debt outstanding but I don't think there's anything same that they can't
    have a premium then if you get if you've got cheap debt well I agree with Austin
    yeah I think that some of these debts will have to buy operating companies like
    you know if you're doing a Salana debt you want to maybe buy a you know a validate
    or set one up or you know that's the thing so there's businesses that these debts
    can all own to help juice their returns it just depends on how vibrant and how
    stable the ecosystem is for that for that particular crypto so that's why I'm
    pretty bearish on the long tail of cryptos out there because most of them are
    very illiquid very small market cap don't have established sort of economies that
    have been functioned there but it's very clear Bitcoin Ethereum Salana has yes
    I agree with that yeah so we have about a little less than five minutes ROM is
    you know and Austin Vinnie used to you I like to end by just asking everyone to
    share just one kind of contrarian thought or just something from this discussion
    that was left on the cutting board so so final thoughts ROM why don't we go to
    you first yeah so like the total return the S&P crushes gold that's one so I could
    actually check that with GROC if you do equal weight it's different but why are
    you doing equal weight you gotta do market cap weight all right all right equal
    weight is you know equal weight is not a market basket right but you know you're
    adding to winners trimming losers and market weight two is by the way my last
    call on the show I think is last week and I also rated six weeks ago is better
    mortgage that's up 57% today up 300% of the last few months but that's been phenomenal
    not financial advice entertainment only I think no wage and cruise lines is quite
    interesting here it's got strong EPS growth or Trenekuides 90% plus they've got
    debt but the bulk of that is customer advances those are customers saying here's
    my money that's called a negative cash conversion cycle by like here's my money
    so I can pay can I use your cruise in the future that's what you want so I like
    I like that concept betting on boomers betting on travel travel and leisure betting
    on consumer discretionary boomers want to stretch more and more retiring past
    peak employment and it comes favorably to their peer group in terms of valuation
    like royal crib and then carnival cruise lines so that's my Norwegian cruise lines
    nice I'll hop in here because mine actually piles on in a different direction
    from what Rama is saying which is I would tell you if we are going to have a breakdown
    in the economy I don't think it's going to be driven in the traditional way that
    people in the United States are used to and what I mean by that is the US experience
    if you look at financial data in this country over the past I don't know 50 years
    more what we've had is a growing young population relative to the elderly population
    are at least stable with a growing working age population is more and more people
    piled into the workforce and we are now on the reversal of the trend of that so
    if we're going to start seeing sort of unwinds in these sorts of things it's going
    to look more like the experience in Asia of the past few decades not as extreme
    but go look at somewhere like Japan because his economy essentially becomes older
    and older and older over time you start to have a total reallocation of where
    efforts go and one you would expect things like cruise lines nursing homes like
    funeral homes to outperform because essentially you're going to be delivering
    more services to a greater population share but two you start to have in a place
    like the US intergenerational warfare and to me if we're going to have a breakdown
    my point to people is it's not going to look the way you think so also please
    please please stop overfitting with past models from the United States.
