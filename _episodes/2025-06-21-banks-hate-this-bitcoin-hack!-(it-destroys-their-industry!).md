    rates because of the size of the debt, it would actually cause more inflation.
    So they were raising interest rates to fight inflation. But when you raise interest
    rates, you're slowing the economy. But the source of the inflation was not from
    the economy. And just look at any other economy that's going to invent his wella,
    they did the strongest demand destruction campaign you'd ever seen. People only
    wanted food and water, but prices still went up. Why? Because the source of inflation
    was not economic demand. It was dilution of the currency. And that's what we have
    here today. When you raise interest rates on $36 trillion of debt, your interest
    rate burden goes up. It's now like the number two most expensive thing in our
    budget, whereas before it wasn't even a top 20 thing. And all of those currency
    units that need to be printed to service the debt lead to more inflation. Vice
    versa, if you lower interest rates, you have $7.5 trillion sitting on the sidelines.

summary: '## Technology Professional Summary: People''s Reserve and the Financialization
  of Bitcoin


  This podcast episode centers on the launch and philosophy of **People''s Reserve**,
  a new financial entity aiming to disrupt traditional banking by leveraging **Bitcoin
  as the "most pristine form of collateral."** The discussion moves from the inherent
  flaws of the current fiat system to the unique advantages Bitcoin offers in credit
  and debt markets, positioning it as the foundation for a new "financial revolution."


  ### Key Takeaways for Technology Professionals:


  **1. Bitcoin as Engineered Collateral & Financial Disruption:**

  * **Core Thesis:** Bitcoin is not just "natural money" like gold but **"engineered
  money,"** strategically designed with a superior Compounding Annual Growth Rate
  (CAGR) compared to real estate or cash.

  * **Disruption:** People''s Reserve aims to disrupt traditional banking by moving
  away from value extraction (modern banking) toward **value delivery and community
  empowerment** (pre-fiat banking models).

  * **Technical Advantage:** Bitcoinâ€™s 24/7/365 liquidity and predictable, engineered
  appreciation make it superior collateral compared to illiquid assets like real estate,
  which pose high risk to lenders upon default.


  **2. The People''s Reserve Model & Free-Market Rates:**

  * **Product Focus:** The service facilitates loans, allowing individuals to borrow
  against their Bitcoin collateral without selling it (preserving capital gains potential).
  They also aim to help users **transform home equity into Bitcoin equity** to benefit
  from Bitcoin''s higher growth trajectory.

  * **Mitigating Liquidation Risk:** A key technical feature is the integration of
  **adjustable interest rates** tied to the collateral''s price. If Bitcoin''s price
  drops, the interest rate adjusts upward (though not to predatory levels) to secure
  the lender and protect the borrower from immediate liquidation.

  * **Free-Market Interest Rates:** People''s Reserve seeks to establish a **free-market
  interest rate** and yield curve, arguing that centralized bodies dictating the "price
  of money" (interest rates) is inherently flawed, similar to price controls on goods.


  **3. Macroeconomic Context: Inflation and Debt Spiral:**

  * **Inflation Source:** A major point of agreement is that current inflation is
  primarily driven by **currency dilution (money printing)**, not just economic demand.
  Raising interest rates exacerbates the debt spiral by increasing the servicing cost
  on the massive national debt, leading to further necessary currency creation.

  * **Actionable Insight:** The speakers strongly advise moving savings **out of dollars
  and into Bitcoin** as a hedge against inevitable price increases across all assets
  due to the fiat system''s trajectory.


  **4. Strategic Implications & Call to Action:**

  * **Financial Revolution:** This initiative frames Bitcoinâ€™s impact as extending
  beyond a monetary revolution into a **financial revolution** by integrating it into
  credit and debt structures.

  * **Launch Timeline:** People''s Reserve plans to go live on **July 4th** ("We the
  People Day").

  * **Actionable Step:** Professionals interested should visit **peoplesreserve.com**
  to sign up for the newsletter and follow the principals (specifically mentioning
  **CJ Constantinos**).


  **Context:** This conversation is critical because it addresses the next phase of
  Bitcoin adoption: **financialization**. It moves past simple holding (HODLing) to
  integrating the asset into complex lending and borrowing structures, challenging
  established financial intermediaries by offering superior collateral mechanics rooted
  in cryptographic certainty rather than centralized trust.'
