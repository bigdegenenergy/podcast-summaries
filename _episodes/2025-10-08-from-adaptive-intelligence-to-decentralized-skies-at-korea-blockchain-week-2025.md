summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: From Adaptive Intelligence to Decentralized
  Skies at Korea Blockchain Week 2025


  This 41-minute episode, recorded live at Korea Blockchain Week 2025, features host
  Josh Krieger interviewing **Shaw Walters, founder of Eliza Labs**, focusing on the
  convergence of AI and blockchain, specifically through the lens of **Adaptive Intelligence**
  and the development of **agent-to-agent economies**.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **Web3 AI Convergence**, exploring how non-deterministic,
  dynamic computing systems (AI agents) can integrate with decentralized finance (DeFi)
  and broader blockchain infrastructure. Key themes include generative tokenomics,
  autonomous agent swarms, and the future of decentralized coordination.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Non-Deterministic Programming:** The shift towards building dynamic computing
  systems where outputs are not fixed every time, requiring new programming paradigms
  akin to instructing a trusted, but variable, human worker.

  *   **ERC-804 Adoption:** Eliza Labs is adopting the Ethereum Foundation''s **ERC-804**
  specification, which enables agents to discover and interact with other agents,
  forming the backbone of a future agent-to-agent economy.

  *   **Decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL):** The future of AI improvement
  lies not in training massive, centralized LLMs, but in decentralized **Reinforcement
  Learning Policy Optimization (RLPO)**, where agents collect and share data on the
  success/failure trajectories of their actions, allowing for smarter, decentralized
  policy refinement without needing massive upfront compute.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Generative Tokenomics:** A move away from fixed tokenomics models that often
  fail (e.g., high valuation, low liquidity) towards **generative token networks**
  that can adapt dynamically.

  *   **Agent-Managed Treasuries:** The concept of autonomous agents learning from
  market cycles to manage liquidity pools and treasury assets, acting as an accessible
  interface for complex quantitative finance strategies.

  *   **Gaming as a Proving Ground:** Gaming is identified as the ideal low-stakes
  environment to test and demonstrate the full loop of agent-to-agent interaction,
  data collection, and incentivized behavior before deploying these systems in high-stakes
  DeFi.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Shaw Walters (Eliza Labs):** The central figure, driving the concept of Adaptive
  Intelligence and building the multi-agent framework (Eliza OS).

  *   **Zubel Lauer:** Mentioned as a key legal partner specializing in blockchain,
  AI, and emerging technologies.

  *   **Perplexity:** Mentioned as a superior tool for information search and concierge-like
  AI services compared to general LLMs for certain tasks.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched upon the challenges of data access, noting that most valuable
  data resides in private networks (Telegram, Discord). Agents capable of navigating
  these private spaces to aggregate information (e.g., social sentiment, insider chatter)
  can derive significant financial insights, bypassing traditional scraping limitations.
  There was also a brief mention of a legal dispute involving X (formerly Twitter)
  regarding advising on platform integrity and account access.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests a future dominated by **autonomous, agent-driven
  commerce and coordination**. This ranges from personal assistants being replaced
  by AI agents to complex business swarms coordinating transactions without direct
  human intervention. The key bottleneck identified is building trust and providing
  verifiable, high-quality data trajectories for agents to learn from, which token
  incentives can help bootstrap.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Web3 Founders, DeFi Developers, AI/ML Engineers
  interested in decentralized applications, and Crypto Investors** seeking insights
  into the next major technological paradigm shift beyond current DeFi and NFT cycles.

  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast segment captures a deep dive into the practical application of AI within
  the blockchain ecosystem, framed by Shaw Walters'' work at Eliza Labs. Walters immediately
  dismisses buzzwords, focusing instead on the technical reality of building **non-deterministic
  computing systems**.


  The core narrative revolves around transitioning from static smart contracts to
  dynamic, intelligent systems. Walters introduced the concept of **generative tokenomics**
  as a necessary evolution to address the fragility of fixed token models prevalent
  in current crypto projects. This ties into a larger vision of an **agent-to-agent
  economy**, where services are automatically brokered via protocols like **ERC-804**,
  eliminating the need for human intermediaries in many routine transactions.


  A significant portion of the discussion focused on **autonomous swarms**—interlocking
  groups of agents that can coordinate organizational tasks. Walters emphasized that
  while the "thousand-year timescale" sees full autonomy, the near-term focus is on
  creating frameworks (like Eliza OS) that allow agents to interact in controlled,
  low-stakes environments, primarily through **video games and coordination experiments**.
  This experimentation is crucial for collecting the necessary data to train agents
  effectively.


  Technically, Walters highlighted the limitations of traditional, centralized LLM
  training (too expensive, requires co-location) and championed a decentralized approach
  centered on **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. By incentivizing agents to share data
  on successful *trajectories* (what worked and what didn''t), the network can collectively
  improve its decision-making policies without needing to retrain the foundational
  LLMs. This RLPO approach is where token incentives can play a meaningful, decentralized
  role.


  Finally, the conversation touched upon the practical utility of agents today, such
  as using them to analyze social sentiment (e.g., identifying which influencers actually
  lead to profitable trades) and the critical need for agents to access data locked
  in private communication channels like Telegram to gain a true informational edge.
  The underlying message is that the convergence of AI and Web3 is less about replacing
  entire LL'
