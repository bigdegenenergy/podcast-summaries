  text: I think it's very analogous to Jane Street. Jane Street viewed itself very
    much as an infrastructure provider, and Jane Street, and I think that's true,
    market makers, liquidity providers just for trading firms in general. Like the
    services they provide are like the providing liquidity, they're doing risk warehousing,

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think institutions are much more sensitive to this idea of like where does
    the yield come from. So the yield could come from places like you have a structural
    efficiency that you have identified that nobody else can do that kind of has provides
    you additional benefits, or there's some amount of scale that you have in your
    business so you can reduce your costs. And there's some amount of yield that comes

    like not only on the staking side and how staking benefits owners of Solana, but
    also like how the liquid staking token works, you know, the fact that it's essentially
    a continuously compounded total return product means that it has a very different

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Ex Jane Street Veteran''s Journey To Crypto
  | Thomas Uhm


  This 46-minute episode features Thomas Uhm, the new Chief Commercial Officer at
  the Gido Foundation, discussing his transition from the traditional finance (TradFi)
  giant Jane Street to the Solana DeFi infrastructure space, focusing heavily on institutional
  adoption and value capture in Web3.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area:**

  The primary focus is the **intersection of TradFi infrastructure expertise and the
  Solana DeFi ecosystem**, specifically through the lens of the Gido Foundation. Key
  themes include institutional onboarding, the role of infrastructure providers (like
  market makers/Jito), and the structural differences between various investment wrappers
  (ETFs vs. corporate treasury plays).


  **2. Key Technical Insights:**

  *   **Infrastructure Analogy:** Jito''s role in Solana is analogous to market makers
  at Jane Street: providing liquidity, risk warehousing, and bridging time gaps to
  ensure fair, orderly, and efficient markets, resulting in tighter spreads and better
  user experience for Solana participants.

  *   **JitoSOL Scalability:** The autonomous delegation of stake via smart contracts
  in JitoSOL suggests a much flatter decay curve for yield compared to other staking
  providers, mitigating concentration risk associated with individual validator reliance.

  *   **Value Capture in Yield:** Institutions scrutinize yield sources, differentiating
  between yield derived from structural efficiency/scale (sustainable) versus yield
  derived purely from taking on increased risk (less sustainable/scalable).


  **3. Market/Investment Angle:**

  *   **Institutional Barriers:** Key hurdles for institutional adoption include domicile
  restrictions, fiduciary responsibility levels, and the degree of centralization
  in decision-making (decentralized structures require broader buy-in, slowing crypto
  adoption).

  *   **Segmenting Institutions:** Effective commercial strategy requires segmenting
  institutions into Buy Side (asset managers, RIAs), Sell Side (banks, brokers), and
  Market Architects (trading firms, custodians) as their value propositions differ
  significantly.

  *   **ETFs vs. Treasury Plays:** ETFs offer a regulated claim on the underlying
  asset basket with built-in protections (e.g., claim cannot go below asset value),
  whereas "MicroStrategy-style" leveraged treasury plays (using debt to buy crypto)
  represent a riskier, levered equity position junior to bondholders.


  **4. Notable Companies/People:**

  *   **Thomas Uhm:** Former digital assets lead at **Jane Street**, now CCO at **Gido
  Foundation**.

  *   **Gido Foundation:** Focus on Solana infrastructure, staking, liquid staking,
  and re-staking.

  *   **JitoBTC/JitoRock:** Mentioned as a key product leveraging JitoRock''s decentralized
  custody network for Bitcoin exposure with yield on Solana.

  *   **Cheyenne (Gido):** Mentioned for providing an excellent interview on Gido’s
  proposition and value capture.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  The discussion touched upon how US regulatory uncertainty (mentioned as a reason
  for scaling back Jane Street’s digital asset business in Q2 ''23) influences institutional
  comfort levels, particularly regarding domicile and operational requirements. The
  structural differences between ETFs and corporate treasury holdings also imply different
  regulatory frameworks and investor protections.


  **6. Future Implications:**

  The future success of Solana hinges on massive user base growth, and institutional
  capital is seen as a critical component of this expansion. Gido''s role is to build
  the necessary infrastructure and commercial framework to make Solana conducive to
  larger capital allocations and more complex applications.


  **7. Target Audience:**

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto/DeFi professionals, Infrastructure
  Builders, TradFi professionals looking to transition, and Institutional Investors**
  seeking nuanced insights into Solana''s ecosystem and institutional onboarding challenges.

  **Comprehensive Narrative Arc:**


  Thomas Uhm details his journey from leading digital assets at Jane Street, where
  he experienced the scaling challenges and regulatory headwinds that led to a temporary
  pivot, to joining Gido to commercialize its core Solana infrastructure offerings.
  A humorous anecdote highlights how a **Lightspeed** founder survey, which ranked
  Gido as the most desirable employer, inadvertently led to his current role.


  The core of the discussion centers on **institutional readiness**. Uhm breaks down
  the complex factors influencing institutional adoption—domicile, fiduciary duty,
  and decision-making centralization—and outlines Gido’s strategy to tailor its value
  proposition across Buy Side, Sell Side, and Market Architect segments. He draws
  a strong parallel between Jane Street''s role as a market infrastructure provider
  (generating value through tighter spreads and efficiency) and Jito''s role in stabilizing
  and optimizing the Solana network for users and validators.


  A significant segment addresses **value capture and revenue generation** beyond
  simple spread capture (market making). Uhm argues that while market making generates
  daily cash flow, scaling requires expanding risk profiles, analogous to how DeFi
  protocols must look beyond headline yield to sustainable sources derived from structural
  efficiency rather than concentrated risk.


  Finally, the conversation contrasts regulated investment wrappers: **ETFs** offer
  safety and a direct claim on assets, whereas **MicroStrategy-style leveraged treasury
  plays** offer higher beta but expose equity holders to junior risk relative to debt
  financing costs. Uhm concludes that genuine institutional interest requires a clearly
  articulated investment thesis for the underlying asset (like Solana) that goes beyond
  simple price speculation.'
