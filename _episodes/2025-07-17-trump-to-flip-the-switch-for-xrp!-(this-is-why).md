summary: '## Podcast Summary: Trump To Flip The Switch For XRP! (This Is Why)


  This 58-minute episode of "Discover Crypto" hosted by DZ and TJ focused heavily
  on the current altcoin market surge, specific bullish catalysts for XRP, and the
  broader implications of potential political shifts on the crypto landscape, particularly
  concerning the US Dollar and Federal Reserve leadership.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus was **Cryptocurrency Market Analysis**, specifically:

  *   **Altcoin Season Confirmation:** Analyzing charts (Total 3 Market Cap) to confirm
  if the market is entering a significant altcoin rally.

  *   **XRP Price Catalysts:** Deep dive into technical indicators (MBRV ratio) and
  political narratives surrounding former President Trump potentially influencing
  the financial system in favor of XRP.

  *   **Ethereum Ecosystem:** Discussion on ETH''s strength, potential price targets
  ($15k), and the growth of the Base ecosystem (mentioning Coinbase events).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **XRP MBRV Golden Cross:** The Moving Average of the MBRV ratio (a short-term
  moving average crossing the 200-day MA) flashed a "golden cross," a signal that
  historically preceded a massive 630% pump for XRP (dubbed the "Trump pump").

  *   **Total 3 Cup and Handle:** The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies excluding
  BTC and ETH (Total 3) has broken out of a multi-year cup and handle pattern. A confirmed
  break above the $1.1 trillion neckline could target a 100% increase toward $1.98
  trillion, signaling strong altcoin momentum.

  *   **Bearish Divergence Warning for Shorts:** While XRP shows bullish signals,
  the hosts noted bearish divergence on the 4-hour RSI. Historically, this divergence
  has preceded sharp 13-22% pullbacks, cautioning against aggressively shorting the
  asset despite the overall bullish sentiment.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Altcoin Season is Here:** Multiple charts, including falling Bitcoin Dominance
  and Total 3 breakouts, strongly suggest the market is entering or is already in
  alt season.

  *   **XRP Price Target Realism:** While acknowledging the community hype, the hosts
  found the prediction of **$5.89** for XRP this cycle to be "very, very doable."
  They also discussed a more aggressive XRP/BTC pair target of **40588 Satoshis**,
  leading to a potential **$6.90** price target against the USD, which they deemed
  "very reasonable."

  *   **Ethereum Value Proposition:** The hosts emphasized that buying ETH in the
  $2,000 range was a "lifetime kind of opportunity," noting that ETH has not yet hit
  a new all-time high, suggesting significant upside remains, potentially reaching
  $15,000.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump:** Central to the episode''s title, discussed in the context
  of potentially replacing Fed Chair Jerome Powell and enacting financial policies
  that could favor XRP or decentralized assets.

  *   **Jerome Powell:** The current Fed Chair, whose potential removal by a Trump
  administration was discussed as a major catalyst for monetary reset narratives.

  *   **Don Alt:** A trader whose past successful XRP/BTC predictions were referenced,
  specifically his roadmap pointing toward the 40588 Satoshi level.

  *   **Ripple/Brad Garlinghouse:** Mentioned regarding their long-term marketing
  efforts and influence, though the hosts expressed skepticism about the token fulfilling
  decade-old projections.

  *   **Coinbase:** Highlighted for its ongoing events supporting the Base ecosystem,
  which the hosts believe is poised for a pump.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Fed Leadership Uncertainty:** The discussion centered on the political maneuvering
  around the Federal Reserve Chair. Powell stated he would resist removal until May
  2026, but the mere possibility of a Trump administration replacing him is driving
  narratives about a potential "monetary reset" and dollar devaluation.

  *   **Congressional Crypto Bill:** A brief mention was made regarding a crypto bill
  in the House of Representatives that the hosts suggested was attempting to place
  restrictions ("a string of hold") on the industry.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is heading toward a period of **intense altcoin
  outperformance**, driven by technical breakouts and potentially catalyzed by macroeconomic
  uncertainty stemming from US monetary policy shifts. Ethereum is positioned as a
  major beneficiary of institutional interest, while XRP''s future hinges significantly
  on political developments and its ability to meet long-term technical targets against
  BTC.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Active Crypto Traders and Investors** who are
  already familiar with market jargon (RSI, dominance, cup and handle) and are looking
  for specific, actionable insights and price targets for major altcoins like XRP
  and ETH, alongside geopolitical context.'
