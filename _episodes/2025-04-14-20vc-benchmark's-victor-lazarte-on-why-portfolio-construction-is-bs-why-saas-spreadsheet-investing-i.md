    you train your model, and you have like GPT-3, which was very cool, but people
    didn't like to use it. And then first, again, RLHF, which is models produced.
    So you take your base model, you produce a bunch of answers, and then you have
    humans pick what they like best. And then you build a model that gives answers
    that humans like a lot more, and then you have ChatGPT. That was the big ChatGPT
    innovation was like RLHF. And now we're getting to this third moment in models,
    which is like pure RL.

  text: I think this is the most interesting thing happening right now in AI, which
    is models, they, if you're not getting a model to be better in something, what
    you do is like you find a deep expert in that subject. And the expert will create
    a question that the model is not able to answer. And then instead of giving the
    model the answer, it will create a rubric to tell the model is like, hey, for
    any answer to that question, here's how you're going to rate it. And then once
    that's done, the model produces like a very large number of answers. And then
    you have like this very large number of pairs of question and answers that are
    graded and use that to train your model, right?

summary: '## 20VC Podcast Summary: Benchmark''s Victor Lazarte on Investing, AI, and
  Founder Traits


  This 67-minute episode of 20VC features Harry Stebings in conversation with **Victor
  Lazarte**, General Partner at Benchmark, drawing on his unique background as a successful
  bootstrapped founder (Wildlife Studios), early investor (Brex), and current VC.
  The discussion spans critiques of current investment practices, the explosive potential
  of AI agents, and the essential traits of top-tier founders.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Venture Capital Strategy and Market Dynamics**, with
  a heavy emphasis on the **Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution** as the dominant
  technological shift. Secondary themes include founder psychology, portfolio construction
  philosophy, and the changing landscape of consumer technology (moving beyond traditional
  social media).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **LLM Adoption as a Market Signal:** The massive, directional growth in LLM
  inference (estimated at 100x flops in two years) is presented not as a future prediction,
  but as a clear, observable present phenomenon, making this "the best time in over
  a decade to start a company."

  *   **The Agent Interface Shift:** The conversation posits that the next major UI
  shift is moving from websites and mobile apps to **AI Agents**. These agents will
  allow customers to interact with businesses as if speaking to a knowledgeable person,
  creating massive disruption opportunities for incumbents who fail to adapt.

  *   **Adjacent Innovation:** Great opportunities often lie *adjacent* to what is
  currently working (e.g., Facebook followed Friendster). Investors should deeply
  understand current successful LLM applications (like ChatGPT, Character AI) to build
  the next generation of tools around them.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Portfolio Construction is "BS":** Lazarte dismisses rigid portfolio construction
  models, arguing that the current environment is so volatile and opportunity-rich
  that buying winners today is the most pragmatic approach, predicting a trillion-dollar
  company will emerge in the next three years.

  *   **The Death of Spreadsheet Investing:** The era of relying on predictable SaaS
  metrics and spreadsheet modeling is over due to rapid technological change. Investment
  decisions must be based on profound market shifts (like the AI wave) rather than
  incremental growth projections.

  *   **The Search for Happiness vs. Wealth:** A provocative discussion suggests that
  while technology drives productivity (wealth), the biggest predictor of happiness
  is deep relationships. Lazarte argues that advanced AI companions/friends, filling
  the void left by declining traditional community structures (including religion),
  represent a massive, untapped consumer opportunity.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Benchmark:** Victor Lazarte’s firm, known for backing category-defining companies.

  *   **Brex (Pedro Franceschi & Henrique Dubugras):** Mentioned as a prime example
  of founders Lazarte deeply trusts, stemming from a shared history of overcoming
  investor exploitation.

  *   **Wildlife Studios:** Lazarte''s bootstrapped gaming success in Latin America,
  providing his foundational operating experience.

  *   **Mercore:** A recent Benchmark investment that achieved $100M ARR in 11 months,
  highlighting exceptional founder execution.

  *   **Character AI:** Cited as a current working model in the LLM space, but predicted
  to be the "Friendster" of the Agent era—a precursor to something much larger.

  *   **Yuri Milner:** Mentioned as the source of the tactical advice to deeply analyze
  a founder’s entire daily schedule to understand their intrinsic motivations.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward a world where **AI agents** become the primary interface
  for commerce and personal interaction, fundamentally reshaping incumbent businesses.
  Furthermore, the conversation suggests a significant shift in consumer technology
  toward **deeply personalized, relational AI companions** that address fundamental
  human needs for understanding and connection, potentially replacing aspects previously
  served by traditional community or religion.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Venture Capitalists, Technology Investors,
  and Startup Founders** operating in the AI space. It provides strategic frameworks
  for evaluating market timing, assessing founder quality beyond standard metrics,
  and understanding the disruptive potential of the agent paradigm shift.'
