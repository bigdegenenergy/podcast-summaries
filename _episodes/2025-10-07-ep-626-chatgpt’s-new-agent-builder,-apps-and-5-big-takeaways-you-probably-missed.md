  text: The big differentiator is, yeah, you can go put these on your website, or
    you can go put these in a web app. And that's the big one of the big differences
    aside from just being able to create agents and agentic workflows on demand without
    a lot of text skills.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Ep 626: ChatGPT’s new Agent Builder, Apps and
  5 BIG takeaways you probably missed


  This episode of the Everyday AI Show focuses on breaking down the significant announcements
  from OpenAI’s recent DevDay conference, arguing that these updates—particularly
  the Agent Builder and the introduction of Apps—signal a fundamental shift in how
  software will be used, moving toward an agent-centric ecosystem that could reshape
  work by 2026.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **OpenAI DevDay announcements**, specifically the **Agent
  Kit (including the drag-and-drop Agent Builder)** and the new **Apps within ChatGPT**.
  The discussion also covers major API updates (GPT-4o Pro, Sora 2, Codex) and the
  broader strategic implications for the AI industry, user experience, and the developer
  ecosystem.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Agent Kit & Drag-and-Drop Builder:** OpenAI introduced a visual, drag-and-drop
  interface for building AI agents, simplifying complex agentic workflows previously
  requiring deep coding knowledge (similar to tools like Zapier or N8N). This builder
  supports powerful models like GPT-4 and GPT-4 Codex.

  *   **Context-Aware Apps Integration:** The new "Apps" feature allows ChatGPT to
  seamlessly call and interact with third-party services (like Canva, Spotify, Zillow)
  within a conversation, carrying context across different applications without manual
  copy-pasting.

  *   **API Model Expansion:** Key models like **GPT-4o Pro** (for complex reasoning),
  **GPT-4o mini** (for cost-efficient image generation), and the new, lower-latency
  **GPT real-time mini** voice model are now available via API, enabling widespread
  integration into third-party products.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **OpenAI''s Long Game Strategy:** Sam Altman confirmed that profitability is
  not a top concern; the current strategy is focused on **investment, growth, and
  ecosystem dominance**, mirroring Amazon’s early playbook of prioritizing user acquisition
  over immediate profit.

  *   **Cannibalization of Startups:** The release of the Agent Builder and enhanced
  native capabilities (like Agent Kit) directly threatens many existing AI startups
  that were essentially building UIs on top of OpenAI''s previous Agent SDK, suggesting
  a pattern of OpenAI absorbing potential competitors.

  *   **Disruption of Automation Markets:** The Agent Builder is positioned as a direct
  challenge to established workflow automation platforms like Zapier and Make.com,
  targeting the $8 billion AI automation market.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **OpenAI/Sam Altman:** Central to the discussion, with Altman’s comments on
  profitability and strategy being a key takeaway.

  *   **Cisco:** Mentioned as a company using Codex to cut code review times in half.

  *   **Third-Party App Partners:** Canva, Spotify, Figma, Zillow, Peloton, Uber,
  and Coursera were cited as early examples of integrated Apps.

  *   **Competitors Mentioned:** Anthropic (as a comparison point for strategy), Zapier,
  Make.com, and Workato (as targets for disruption).

  *   **Stephen Johnson (Notebook LM Co-founder):** Featured in an ad spot, highlighting
  AI tools for organizing complex information.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The convergence of Apps and Agents suggests that **ChatGPT is evolving into a primary
  operating system**, potentially leading to the "death of the web" as users increasingly
  interact with services *inside* the LLM environment rather than navigating traditional
  websites or browsers. Furthermore, the advancements in **Codex** signal the **beginning
  of the end for traditional programming** as AI-assisted code generation becomes
  the industry standard.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI/Tech Professionals, Software Developers,
  Business Leaders, and Product Managers** who need to quickly understand the strategic
  implications of OpenAI’s latest platform shifts and how they will impact product
  roadmaps and market competition over the next few years.'
