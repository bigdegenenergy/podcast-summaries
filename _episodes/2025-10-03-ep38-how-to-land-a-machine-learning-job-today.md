  text: I think some of the interviews that I failed initially were because I had
    not prepared well in the sense of ML depth, or let's say because I did not have
    a focus area. So at that point, I was more of a generalist. I knew some knowledge,
    I had projects in different domains. So then they asked me deeper questions, I
    did not know them, and my interviews were failing.

    know what the interviewer is going to ask you. So it can be a design question
    end-to-end, or it can be they will give you some scenario, okay, what kind of
    model would you use in the scenario, or what kind of sampling technique would
    you use in the scenario. So it's like environmental, ML design, and ML coding
    also sometimes.

- impact_reason: Contrasts the Big Tech approach with the startup approach, suggesting
    smaller firms are quicker to adopt practical, LLM-assisted workflows in hiring.

  text: But if you are applying for a startup company or a smaller company, then obviously
    they will have all those live sessions with you, and they will ask you, hey, you
    can use LLM within that one to two hours of interview, and they will ask you to
    build everything, share your screen, and do everything on the fly.

    10 years down the line. I see myself as an entrepreneur, running multiple businesses,
    which includes my passion for study abroad and monetizing that area as well, and
    then obviously the ML area, which is my core piece.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Ep38: How to Land a Machine Learning Job Today


  This episode of the Data Neighbor podcast features **Umang Chaudhary**, a Machine
  Learning Engineer at TikTok and former MLE/Software Engineer at Amazon. The central
  theme revolves around the **current state and future viability of ML engineering
  roles** amidst rapid AI advancements, coupled with practical advice on breaking
  into the field.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Machine Learning Career Development and Job Market Navigation**,
  specifically addressing anxieties about AI automating ML jobs, the practical steps
  for interview preparation, and Umang’s personal journey transitioning from Software
  Engineering to ML within Big Tech. The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on
  daily ML workflows and productivity is also a key area.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **LLMs in Production ML:** LLMs are being integrated into production systems,
  not just for model building, but also for enhancing transparency (e.g., explaining
  why a user was suspended based on policy violations) in risk detection systems.

  *   **Interview Preparation Gap:** There is a recognized lack of comprehensive,
  structured resources for ML interviews, which often cover a wide range of topics
  including end-to-end system design, model selection scenarios, and ML coding, requiring
  candidates to learn through trial and error.

  *   **Leveraging LLMs for Prep:** Advanced users (like Umang) find LLMs (specifically
  mentioning Grok as highly comprehensive for this task) incredibly effective for
  practicing ML System Design interviews by engaging in multi-turn discussions about
  trade-offs and follow-up questions.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Entrepreneurial Vision:** Umang is actively working to build a business around
  ML career guidance and mentorship, viewing it as his next major milestone beyond
  his current engineering role.

  *   **Demand for AI/ML Roles:** Despite fears of automation, the demand for professionals
  who can structure and guide ML careers remains high, evidenced by the common theme
  Umang hears from mentees questioning the future of MLE jobs.

  *   **Transitioning Non-Engineers:** There is a market for helping non-traditional
  profiles (like Web Developers or Data Analysts) transition directly into entry/mid-level
  ML Engineer roles, though it requires significant, dedicated effort (6 months to
  a year).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Umang Chaudhary:** The guest, an MLE at TikTok, whose journey from a non-ML
  software role at Amazon to ML serves as a case study.

  *   **Amazon:** Highlighted for its internal mobility structure, notably the **lack
  of a mandatory lock-in period** allowing Umang to transition from a retail web development
  team to the Prime Video forecasting team within months of starting full-time.

  *   **TikTok:** Umang''s current employer, where he works on risk detection (identifying
  malicious user behavior).


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that while the specific structure of ML jobs may evolve
  rapidly due to AI, the **need for skilled individuals who understand the fundamentals
  and can apply them strategically will persist.** The future favors those who are
  curious, adaptable, and proficient in leveraging new tools like LLMs for both productivity
  and deep learning/interview preparation, rather than those who rely solely on static,
  traditional resources.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Aspiring Machine Learning Engineers, current
  Software Engineers looking to transition into ML, and ML Mentors/Coaches.** It is
  also relevant for **AI Product Managers** seeking foundational knowledge.'
