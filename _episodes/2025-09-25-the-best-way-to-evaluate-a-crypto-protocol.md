summary: '**Podcast Summary: The Best Way to Evaluate a Crypto Protocol**


  **Crypto Focus Area:**

  The episode delves into the evaluation metrics for blockchain protocols, particularly
  focusing on the transition from Total Value Locked (TVL) to revenue as a more significant
  metric. It discusses the broader implications for DeFi and Web3, highlighting the
  need for a more nuanced understanding of value creation in blockchain ecosystems.


  **Key Technical Insights:**

  - **Revenue as a Key Metric:** Lily Liu argues that revenue should be the "north
  star" metric for evaluating blockchain protocols, as it provides a clearer picture
  of value creation than TVL, which can be easily manipulated.

  - **Mechanisms of Value Creation:** The podcast explores how utility and usage on
  a blockchain translate into value and price creation for token holders. It emphasizes
  the importance of understanding the flow from transaction volume to fee revenue
  and its impact on protocol value.

  - **Revenue Components:** The discussion breaks down the sources of protocol revenue
  into inflation, base fees, and priority fees, highlighting how these contribute
  to the overall revenue model and value capture for token holders.


  **Market/Investment Angle:**

  - **TVL vs. Revenue:** The episode critiques the reliance on TVL as a primary metric,
  suggesting that it does not necessarily correlate with actual value creation or
  capture. It highlights the importance of revenue as a more reliable indicator of
  a protocol''s economic activity and potential for growth.

  - **Investment Implications:** By focusing on revenue, investors can better assess
  the long-term sustainability and profitability of blockchain protocols, moving beyond
  superficial metrics like TVL.


  **Notable Crypto Projects/People:**

  - **Lily Liu:** President of the Solana Foundation, she provides insights into the
  evaluation of blockchain protocols and the importance of revenue as a metric.

  - **Solana and Ethereum:** These protocols are mentioned in the context of their
  revenue models and inflation rates, providing examples of how different blockchains
  approach value creation.


  **Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  The episode does not delve deeply into regulatory or policy issues, focusing instead
  on the internal metrics and evaluation frameworks within the crypto industry.


  **Future Implications:**

  - **Evolving Metrics:** The conversation suggests a shift in the industry towards
  more sophisticated metrics for evaluating blockchain protocols, moving beyond TVL
  to focus on revenue and other indicators of real economic activity.

  - **Innovation and Revenue:** The discussion acknowledges the tension between innovation
  and revenue focus, suggesting that successful protocols will balance these aspects
  to drive long-term growth.


  **Target Audience:**

  The episode is particularly valuable for investors and analysts in the crypto space
  who are interested in understanding the deeper metrics of blockchain valuation.
  Developers and protocol designers may also find the discussion on value creation
  mechanisms insightful.


  **Main Narrative Arc and Key Discussion Points:**

  The episode centers on the need to move beyond TVL as a primary metric for evaluating
  blockchain protocols. It argues for revenue as a more meaningful indicator of value
  creation and explores the mechanisms through which blockchain utility translates
  into economic value. The discussion highlights the limitations of TVL and the importance
  of understanding the revenue model of protocols to assess their true potential.


  **Technical Concepts, Methodologies, or Frameworks Discussed:**

  The podcast introduces a framework for evaluating blockchain protocols based on
  revenue components, including inflation, base fees, and priority fees. It emphasizes
  the need to distinguish between different layers of blockchain ecosystems—network,
  applications, and asset layer—and their respective revenue models.


  **Business Implications and Strategic Insights:**

  The episode provides strategic insights for investors and protocol designers, emphasizing
  the importance of focusing on revenue as a metric for long-term sustainability and
  growth. It highlights the need for a shared language around blockchain business
  models to facilitate better evaluation and investment decisions.


  **Predictions, Trends, or Future-Looking Statements:**

  The conversation predicts a shift in the industry towards more sophisticated evaluation
  metrics, with revenue taking center stage as a key indicator of protocol success.
  It suggests that protocols that can effectively capture and demonstrate revenue
  will be better positioned for future growth.


  **Practical Applications and Real-World Examples:**

  The discussion uses Solana and Ethereum as examples to illustrate different approaches
  to revenue generation and value capture. It provides practical insights into how
  these protocols manage inflation and transaction fees to drive economic activity.


  **Controversies, Challenges, or Problems Highlighted:**

  The episode highlights the challenge of gaming metrics like TVL and the need for
  more reliable indicators of value creation. It also addresses the potential for
  revenue metrics to be manipulated through practices like wash trading.


  **Solutions, Recommendations, or Actionable Advice Provided:**

  The podcast recommends focusing on revenue as a key metric for evaluating blockchain
  protocols and encourages the development of a shared language around blockchain
  business models. It suggests that investors and analysts should look beyond TVL
  to assess the true potential of protocols.'
