    equally important in the central conversation of Bitcoin becoming a strategic
    reserve.
  topic: Technology/Strategy

    Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF)—its primary holding is SDRs, not just cash,
    which sets up the comparison with Bitcoin.

  text: The Treasury has an ESF facility, but what's inside this facility is actually
    not what people think. Some of it is dollars and some of it is other currencies,

    are Special Drawing Rights.

    it can be paid back for. And then it becomes kind of like nationalized in the
    construct of the role of that asset. That's like almost like the central bank

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Why Isn’t Bitcoin Pumping While Gold Soars?
  | Jeff Park


  This 41-minute episode of the Pomp Podcast features host Anthony Pompliano (Pomp)
  interviewing Jeff Park, CIO of ProCAP BTC, for a macro-focused discussion centered
  on the current divergence between gold''s strong performance and Bitcoin''s lagging
  price action, despite favorable macroeconomic conditions for crypto.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centered on **Global Macroeconomics and Digital Assets**, specifically
  analyzing the plumbing of the dollarized global economy, the role of reserve assets
  (Gold vs. Bitcoin), and the implications of central bank interventions in distressed
  economies (e.g., Argentina). Key themes included currency stability, geopolitical
  trade wars (US/China), and the future utility of Bitcoin as a collateral asset at
  the nation-state level.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **SDRs as a Precursor to Bitcoin:** Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)—a basket of
  major currencies used by the IMF—are discussed as a historical attempt at a neutral
  reserve asset, drawing parallels to what Bitcoin could eventually represent in global
  financial plumbing.

  *   **The Mechanics of Central Bank Intervention:** The conversation detailed how
  the US Treasury uses the Exchange Stabilization Facility (ESF), which primarily
  holds SDRs, to intervene in foreign exchange markets, highlighting the complex mechanisms
  underpinning dollar stability.

  *   **Bitcoin as Pristine Collateral:** Park suggests Bitcoin’s future utility at
  the nation-state level might first manifest not as a retail currency, but as "pristine
  collateral" that can be pledged, lent, and borrowed in B2B or sovereign finance
  contexts, similar to how gold is used.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Gold''s Dominance Driven by Certainty:** Gold is currently outperforming due
  to investor demand for certainty amid global chaos (Argentina, China tensions),
  driven by both retail flows and central bank accumulation (notably by the Shanghai
  Futures Exchange).

  *   **Macro Conditions Favorable for Risk Assets:** Park notes that increasing credit
  creation and liquidity from governments (fiscal dominance in the US and China) generally
  supports risk assets, making Bitcoin’s current lag surprising.

  *   **Central Bank Adoption is Key:** The most important driver for Bitcoin''s long-term
  adoption and profitability as a store of value is central bank involvement, mirroring
  the historical path of gold.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jeff Park (CIO, ProCAP BTC):** The expert guest providing the macro analysis
  and perspective on asset utility.

  *   **Janet Yellen (US Treasury Secretary):** Mentioned in the context of using
  SDRs from the ESF to intervene in the Argentine peso market.

  *   **Javier Milei (Argentine President):** Discussed regarding his aggressive austerity
  measures and the resulting societal pain and political backlash.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Dollar Swap Lines:** The re-emergence of dollar swap lines (plumbing of the
  dollarized economy) to stabilize countries like Argentina was a central policy discussion
  point, illustrating the global reliance on the USD.

  *   **Trade War as Capital War:** The US-China trade conflict is framed as evolving
  into a "capital war," where countries negotiate not just trade terms but also capital
  account flows and investment access.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that Bitcoin is currently undervalued relative to its
  potential role in the global financial system. While gold is capturing short-term
  fear-driven flows, Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory hinges on its integration into
  sovereign finance—potentially replacing the SDR as the preferred neutral, liquid
  collateral asset used by central banks and nations.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  **Crypto/Web3 Professionals and Macro Investors.** This episode is highly valuable
  for those who track geopolitical risk, understand central bank operations, and are
  looking beyond retail adoption to understand Bitcoin’s potential role in institutional
  and sovereign finance.'
