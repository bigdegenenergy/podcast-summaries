    the people have locked in rates at lower levels. So if they sell their house,

    hurt? Well, one of the ways clearly that they've come to is the possibility that
    if we eliminate the capital gains tax on housing, it's not like every person would
    go out and get rid of their home. So it wouldn't unleash, let's say, an expense
    side to the government that was huge, but what it would do is kind of release
    the ability of people to do this because if you have to reset your mortgage at
    a higher rate, but you're foregoing capital gains tax, you obviously have the

  During The AI Era


  This 50-minute episode features financial veteran Jordy Visser discussing the confluence
  of macroeconomic policy, the re-industrialization of the US economy driven by AI,
  and the resulting implications for asset allocation, with a strong underlying theme
  suggesting Bitcoin will benefit significantly from these shifts.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area**: Macroeconomics, US Fiscal/Monetary Policy (Federal Reserve),
  US Re-industrialization (AI, Energy, Manufacturing), Housing Market Dynamics, and
  Investment Strategy.


  **2. Key Technical Insights**:

  *   **PMI as a Leading Indicator**: The ISM Purchasing Managers'' Index (PMI) is
  crucial as it has a high correlation with S&P 500 earnings; its sustained weakness
  since 2022 (except for brief bumps) signals a lack of manufacturing growth, which
  is now poised to change due to AI-driven hardware needs.

  *   **AI Embodiment Requires Hardware**: The current AI wave is moving from pure
  software (LLMs) to the "embodiment side"—physical hardware like drones, humanoid
  robots, and crucially, the massive data centers and power infrastructure required
  to run them.

  *   **Energy Constraint on AI Growth**: The primary constraint on future AI growth
  is not semiconductors, but electricity supply, with estimates suggesting a need
  for 90 GW of additional power by 2030, creating massive investment opportunities
  in power generation and grid stability.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle**:

  *   **Shift from Software to Industrialization**: Investors must pivot focus from
  the last 18 years of software dominance (Mag 7) toward the coming decade of re-industrialization,
  benefiting sectors like energy, materials, mining, and power infrastructure.

  *   **Labor Shortages Favor Automation**: Significant labor shortages in blue-collar,
  manufacturing, and energy sectors mean that robotics and automation are not primarily
  job destroyers but necessary gap-fillers for jobs humans are increasingly unwilling
  or unable to do.

  *   **Fiscal Dominance and Rates**: The Federal Reserve’s independence is effectively
  over due to massive US debt and deficits. The Fed is now incentivized to lower rates
  to manage the government''s skyrocketing interest expense, supporting asset prices.


  **4. Notable Companies/People**:

  *   **Jordy Visser & Anthony Pompliano**: Hosts/guests driving the analysis.

  *   **Bill Poultney**: Mentioned in context of administration focus on unlocking
  the housing market.

  *   **MP Materials**: Highlighted as a key US rare earth mineral company receiving
  recent deals from the DOD and Apple, underscoring geopolitical supply chain risks.

  *   **Eric Schmidt**: Cited for stating that electricity, not chips, is the limiting
  factor for AI growth.

  *   **Jensen Huang (Nvidia CEO)**: Quoted as advising students to study physics
  over coding, signaling the shift toward physical engineering and industrial application.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion**:

  *   **Capital Gains Tax Elimination**: Discussion centered on the possibility of
  President Trump eliminating capital gains tax, particularly on housing, as a massive
  stimulus to unlock transactions for homeowners locked into low mortgage rates.

  *   **Fed Transparency Lawsuit**: A lawsuit (Azoria/Fishback) challenges the Fed''s
  practice of conducting official FOMC business behind closed doors, arguing it violates
  federal sunshine laws, adding to the pressure on the central bank.

  *   **Fiscal Dominance**: The massive US debt load forces the Fed to prioritize
  lower rates to prevent a fiscal spiral, confirming the end of true monetary independence.


  **6. Future Implications**:

  The future points toward a significant, government-supported re-industrialization
  cycle driven by the physical demands of AI (data centers, power, materials). This
  will create inflationary pressures in physical commodities and energy, while simultaneously
  requiring a new generation of engineers focused on physics and industrial application
  rather than purely software coding. The need for energy and materials will be a
  major economic driver, potentially boosting assets tied to these sectors, including
  Bitcoin (as a hard asset hedge against fiscal expansion).


  **7. Target Audience**: Professionals in finance, asset management, institutional
  investors, and technology strategists interested in the intersection of macro policy,
  industrial technology trends, and long-term portfolio positioning.'
