    biometrics look like for a good customer who's visiting the site the right way...

    AI/automation in chargeback defense for low-value disputes, where manual intervention
    is economically infeasible.

  text: The average card value might be $2,000, but then if it's $20, you really have
    to find a way to dynamically fight those charge backs that has as little human
    intervention as possible. Because it's not worth it. This has been $25 to fight
    a $20 charge back.
  topic: technical/business
- impact_reason: Identifies first-party fraud (friendly fraud) as the fastest-growing
    and most dangerous type of chargeback fraud due to the dual loss of revenue and
    inventory.

  text: I think the biggest challenge over the last couple of years has been the growth
    in first party fraud resulting in a charge back. It's particularly dangerous in

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Fraud Prevention in the Digital Age from KYC
  to Chargebacks - with Matt DeLauro of SEON


  This 24-minute episode of the AI and Business Podcast, featuring Matt DeLauro, President
  at Cian Technologies, provided a comprehensive overview of the evolving challenges
  and advanced solutions in digital fraud prevention across various industries, emphasizing
  the need for agility and early intervention.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centered on **advanced fraud prevention workflows** in the digital
  age, moving beyond traditional, siloed checks. Key themes included the limitations
  of **legacy fraud systems**, the necessity of **data aggregation**, the impact of
  **"Fraud as a Service"** on sophisticated attacks, and the strategic implementation
  of **"shift left"** methodologies. A significant portion was dedicated to tackling
  the growing problem of **chargebacks**, particularly those stemming from first-party
  fraud, and leveraging AI for dynamic defense.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Shift Left and Implicit Data Capture:** The industry is moving toward introducing
  frictionless, observable capabilities much earlier in the customer journey (shift
  left). This involves capturing rich, implicit data—such as IP information and behavioral
  biometrics—in the background rather than relying solely on hard, friction-inducing
  Know Your Customer (KYC) checks later on.

  *   **Dynamic Friction Implementation:** The most effective fraud teams implement
  **dynamic friction**, profiling visitors pre-KYC to simultaneously remove friction
  for high-value customers (improving conversion) and increase barriers for potential
  fraudsters.

  *   **LLMs for Dynamic Argumentation in Chargebacks:** Large Language Models (LLMs)
  are drastically lowering the cost and effort required to construct **dynamic arguments**
  to fight chargebacks. By feeding LLMs rich data (device fingerprinting, location
  data, session history), they can construct powerful, narrative-based defenses that
  were previously manual and expensive to create.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Agility Over Legacy Systems:** The primary business challenge is that digital
  experiences (new products, markets) iterate faster than legacy fraud systems can
  adapt, creating significant pressure on fraud teams to maintain assurance levels.

  *   **Democratization of Sophisticated Fraud Tools:** The rise of "Fraud as a Service"
  means sophisticated attack tools (like those leveraging generative AI for profile
  creation) are accessible to smaller fraud rings, forcing legitimate businesses to
  adopt equally advanced, multi-perspective defense mechanisms.

  *   **Urgency in Retail vs. Financial Services:** Retailers face a higher sense
  of urgency regarding fraud prevention because rising chargeback rates can immediately
  impact revenue (e.g., losing payment methods), whereas financial institutions often
  face regulatory penalties that may materialize over a longer timeline.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Matt DeLauro (President, Cian Technologies):** The expert guest, providing
  insights from Cian’s work in providing AI/ML-driven fraud prevention across the
  customer journey.

  *   **Cian Technologies:** The sponsoring company, highlighted for its solutions
  that aggregate rich session data and leverage AI for fraud mitigation.

  *   **Tacobas (Mentioned Example):** Used as an example of a business selling soft
  goods where the marginal utility of winning a chargeback is high, even if the average
  transaction value is low, necessitating automated defense.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward highly **unified, data-driven fraud views** that integrate
  data silos (e.g., AML, payments fraud, KYC teams) within large institutions. The
  future of defense lies in **proactive, background monitoring** using behavioral
  biometrics and device intelligence, coupled with **AI-driven automation** for reactive
  processes like chargeback defense, ensuring security without sacrificing customer
  conversion rates.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Fraud Operations Leaders, Risk Management
  Executives, Data Science Teams** involved in anomaly detection, and **Technology
  Strategists** in the **Fintech, E-commerce, and Retail sectors** who are navigating
  the transition from legacy compliance checks to modern, AI-augmented defense postures.'
