summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Raoul Pal: The 2025 Crypto Bull Run Is CANCELED
  (i''m sorry)


  This episode centers on a significant recalibration of the expected timeline for
  the next major crypto bull run, driven by macroeconomic analysis from global investor
  Raoul Pal, alongside specific insights into emerging altcoin sectors like AI and
  agentic commerce.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Macroeconomic Drivers of the Crypto Cycle**, specifically
  linking Bitcoin''s performance to the **ISM (Institute for Supply Management) Purchasing
  Managers Index**, which serves as a proxy for the global business cycle. Secondary
  focus areas include **AI/Decentralized Compute (BitTensor)** and **Agentic Commerce/Payment
  Infrastructure (Sweet)**.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Business Cycle Dominance:** Bitcoin''s price action is fundamentally tied
  to the business cycle (ISM), not just the four-year halving schedule. The current
  market weakness reflects the economy remaining in a contractionary phase (ISM below
  50).

  *   **Debt Maturity Extension:** The primary reason for the cycle shift is the extension
  of debt maturity from four years to five years in 2021-2022, which has elongated
  the expected crypto cycle.

  *   **Agentic Commerce Infrastructure:** The Sweet protocol is highlighted for its
  unique ability to handle **batch transfers automatically and instantly**, positioning
  it for the future where AI agents facilitate the majority of online transactions
  (agentic commerce).


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Bull Run Timeline Shift:** Raoul Pal suggests the traditional four-year cycle
  is now a **five-year cycle**. Consequently, the peak of the next cycle is projected
  to be delayed until **2026, likely Q2**.

  *   **Buying Opportunity:** Dips while the ISM remains below 50 (indicating economic
  contraction) are framed as historically proven buying opportunities, mirroring patterns
  seen in 2015-2016 and 2019-2020.

  *   **Altcoin Focus (BitTensor):** Significant investment interest is noted in BitTensor
  (TAU) and its subnets (e.g., Subnet 64 for serving AI models cheaply, Subnet 11
  for consumer apps), suggesting decentralized AI infrastructure is a key area building
  through the current market phase.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Raoul Pal:** The central figure providing the macroeconomic framework, arguing
  for the five-year cycle based on debt maturity influencing the ISM.

  *   **Justin (Altcoin Daily Host):** Highlighting the launch of **Stillcore Capital**,
  a new fund focused on BitTensor (TAU).

  *   **BitTensor Subnets:** Specific mention of **Subnet 64 (Shoots)**, **Subnet
  11 (Dippy)**, and **Subnet 33 (Ready AI)**, emphasizing real-world utility and high-profile
  backing (ex-Meta/Google talent).

  *   **Sweet:** Discussed for its partnership with Google on the **AP2 agentic payment
  framework** and its focus on incentivizing content creators in the agentic future.

  *   **Alex (SwissBorg):** Mentioned for the aggressive **BORG token buyback program**,
  utilizing 50% of trading fees, projecting significant buy pressure.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No direct regulatory discussions were detailed, but the underlying theme of **monetary
  policy (interest rates)** driving the business cycle is central to Pal''s analysis,
  implying that the timing of rate cuts is crucial for economic expansion and, subsequently,
  crypto market breakout.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is heading toward a period where macroeconomic forces dictate the timing
  of major rallies, pushing the expected peak further out to 2026. Simultaneously,
  significant development is occurring in specialized sectors: AI infrastructure (BitTensor)
  and the foundational layer for AI-driven transactions (Agentic Commerce via Sweet).


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Professional Crypto Investors, Macro Analysts,
  and Institutional Strategists** who rely on cyclical analysis, macroeconomic indicators
  (ISM, rates), and deep dives into emerging infrastructure narratives (AI/Agentic
  Tech).'
