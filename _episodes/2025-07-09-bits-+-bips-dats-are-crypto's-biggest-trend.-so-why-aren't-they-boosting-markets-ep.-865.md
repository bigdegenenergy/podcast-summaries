    high-growth, high-volatility public tech/thematic stocks (like those favored by
    Cathie Wood), indicating a shift in risk appetite outside of pure crypto.

  text: Momentum and volatility is one of the best performers over the last 12 months.
    That's what's going on. One of the primary value propositions of a crypto asset
    is momentum and volatility. Public equity markets are delivering that and that's
    trying to pull the interest, you know, in that area.

    regulatory environment for crypto compared to the previous boom era, which is
    crucial for institutional adoption.

    funds, is currently being deployed—away from direct crypto assets and towards
    public market vehicles.

    It's not. It's still you type in a ticker, you scroll for this and that. So those
    are some quick thoughts on the tokenization plan.
  topic: Strategy/Technology
- impact_reason: Provides historical context, noting that the concept of tokenization
    has been discussed for nearly a decade without massive, transformative adoption,
    suggesting the current hype needs a catalyst.

    think it was 2024 and the title was something like Why Tokenization is failing.
    I led it with a presentation I heard from a couple of partners at McKinsey that
    I think I also heard back in 2016. Tokenization as a concept is pretty old in
    terms of crypto's history.

    immensely with the accounting and operational changes required for tokenized assets,

    leads to subpar products that fail, causing unnecessary bearish sentiment, because
    the enterprise adoption timeline hasn''t caught up.'

    quicker because everything does move quickly in this in this space, that in the

    settle 24/7), confirming the technical barrier to entry for tokenized assets in
    legacy systems.

  text: One of the challenges with a lot of the tokenized stock, and this is what
    Robinhood is referring to, there's the actual infrastructure for imagining like

    like this?

  topic: adoption/regulation
- impact_reason: Reveals the high average transaction size ($100k-$200k) in stablecoin

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Bits + Bips: DATs Are Crypto''s Biggest Trend. So Why
  Aren''t They Boosting Markets? - Ep. 865


  This 80-minute episode of Bits + Bips dives deep into the collision of cryptocurrency
  trends, macroeconomics, and recent political developments, focusing heavily on the
  market reaction (or lack thereof) to new tariff threats and the evolving structure
  of the crypto market.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centered on **Macroeconomic Policy and Crypto Market Structure**.
  Key topics included:

  *   The implications of potential new tariffs threatened by Donald Trump against
  several nations (Japan, South Korea, etc.).

  *   The current state of the US dollar and US economic exceptionalism.

  *   The bifurcation of the crypto market: the performance of Bitcoin versus altcoins/smart
  contract platforms.

  *   The significant suppression of volatility (implied by low option premiums) across
  crypto assets, and where that volatility has migrated.

  *   The impact of institutional adoption (ETFs) on market maturity.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Volatility Migration:** Realized volatility for Bitcoin has plummeted, driven
  by institutional adoption (ETFs, structured products like covered calls). This suppressed
  volatility has migrated to public equities holding crypto exposure, such as MicroStrategy
  (MSTR) and publicly traded crypto miners, whose charts now resemble those of highly
  volatile altcoins from previous cycles.

  *   **Maturity of Bitcoin:** The suppression of volatility suggests Bitcoin is maturing
  as an asset class, implying that the era of 10x returns is likely behind it, as
  institutional structures inherently dampen extreme price swings.

  *   **On-Chain Activity Decline:** There is a notable lack of on-chain activity;
  most current volume is occurring through centralized exchanges and public markets,
  indicating that the demand for many native crypto tokens (beyond the top tier) is
  weak.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Tariffs as Theater:** The consensus among the panelists is that Trump’s tariff
  threats are largely "theater" and political bluster, likely intended for negotiation
  leverage (especially concerning Japan''s upcoming election), rather than an immediate
  catalyst for severe market panic.

  *   **Bifurcated Crypto Market:** The market is sharply divided. Bitcoin is acting
  as a macro asset, seeing institutional inflows via ETFs, positioning it as an asset
  "people have to own." In contrast, the rest of the crypto market (smart contract
  platforms and smaller tokens) is struggling significantly due to a lack of demonstrable
  product-market fit (PMF) and waning speculative bids based on "future hope."

  *   **Contrarian Macro View:** A contrarian view suggests the death of the US dollar
  is exaggerated, as US short rates and growth options remain superior globally, offering
  a potential hedge against dollar weakness by diversifying into international value
  plays with momentum.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Donald Trump:** Central figure due to the threatened tariffs and his influence
  on market sentiment.

  *   **Jerome Powell (The Fed):** Discussed regarding the pressure he faces from
  political actors (including commentary from the Secretary of State referencing "working
  the refs") concerning interest rate decisions, especially in light of potential
  inflationary impacts from trade policy.

  *   **MicroStrategy (MSTR):** Cited as the prime example of where crypto volatility
  has migrated, showing dramatically higher annualized volatility than Bitcoin itself.

  *   **Robinhood & Revolut:** Mentioned in the context of M&A and strategic moves
  (like Revolut potentially launching an L2), showing activity is occurring in public
  or regulated entities, not just native crypto projects.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched on the political pressure on the Federal Reserve, suggesting
  that the Fed''s recent shifts in communication might reflect forecasting uncertainty
  around trade policy rather than purely data-driven decisions. The panelists noted
  the administration''s general pro-innovation stance benefiting sectors like crypto,
  nuclear energy, and quantum computing.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward greater **maturation and institutionalization**, making
  it harder for unmitigated crypto traders to profit compared to previous cycles.
  The focus is shifting from speculative future promises to demonstrable product-market
  fit. Volatility is expected to remain suppressed in core crypto assets through the
  summer, with a potential tick-up in native crypto volatility only likely in Q4.
  The market is increasingly resembling traditional equity markets in structure and
  trading dynamics.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Investors, Macro Strategists, and Venture
  Capital Professionals** who need to understand the interplay between geopolitical
  risk, Federal Reserve policy, and the structural changes occurring within the digital
  asset market.'
