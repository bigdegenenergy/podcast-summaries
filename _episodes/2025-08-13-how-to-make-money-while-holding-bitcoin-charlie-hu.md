summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: How To Make Money While Holding Bitcoin | Charlie
  Hu


  This 41-minute podcast episode, hosted by Anthony Pompliano (Pom) featuring Charlie
  Hu, Co-founder of BitLayer, centers entirely on the emerging landscape of **Bitcoin
  Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** and the infrastructure required to unlock yield and
  utility for Bitcoin holders.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is on **Bitcoin DeFi**, exploring the technical necessity, current
  state, and future potential of building programmable applications and generating
  yield on top of the Bitcoin network. Secondary themes include the global adoption
  dichotomy between Asian retail investors and Western institutions, and the technical
  challenges of scalability (speed and cost) versus security inherent in Bitcoin''s
  base layer.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Bitcoin Finality Requirement:** True Bitcoin DeFi, in Charlie Hu''s view,
  requires that transactions ultimately settle on the Bitcoin network (Bitcoin finality),
  differentiating it from less secure sidechains that lack a direct link to Bitcoin''s
  security model.

  *   **The "Ideal" Bitcoin DeFi Stack:** The optimal design involves using a Layer
  2/Rollup structure where heavy transaction throughput is handled off-chain, but
  the final proof settles on the Bitcoin block (via recursive proofs/verification).
  This structure must utilize **Bitcoin as gas fees** and **Bitcoin as liquidity assets**.

  *   **Scalability Trade-off:** Bitcoin L1''s current 7 TPS is insufficient for mass
  DeFi adoption. New infrastructure must provide high throughput and lower costs (solving
  the high gas fees seen during Ordinals peaks) while maintaining the security derived
  from the L1 settlement layer.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Value Unlock:** Bringing DeFi programmability to Bitcoin—the most decentralized
  and secure asset—represents a "major value unlock" and catalyst, as it utilizes
  an asset that has historically been "underutilized" or "idle."

  *   **Asian Retail Driving Demand:** Asian retail communities (particularly in Vietnam)
  are currently the most active users and experimenters in the Bitcoin ecosystem,
  driving early demand for new use cases like Ordinals and DeFi tooling, often moving
  faster than Western institutional adoption.

  *   **Institutional vs. Retail Dynamics:** While Western institutions entered via
  ETFs, the builders and early users exploring on-chain utility are predominantly
  retail, often digital nomads who prioritize decentralized, permissionless access.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Charlie Hu (BitLayer):** Co-founder of BitLayer, focused on building the necessary
  infrastructure for Bitcoin DeFi.

  *   **Loi Luu (Kyber Network):** Mentioned as an OG DeFi builder and an early investor
  in BitLayer, highlighting Vietnam''s deep roots in DeFi building.

  *   **WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin):** Cited as the "first generation Bitcoin bridging,"
  which relied on centralized multi-sig custody to bring BTC liquidity to Ethereum
  DeFi.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion touched on regulatory clarity as a catalyst, noting that the approval
  of Bitcoin ETFs in the US, followed by Hong Kong and Australia, signals growing
  institutional acceptance, which will eventually pave the way for regulated DeFi
  applications built around Bitcoin.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests the future of Bitcoin is evolving beyond "digital
  gold" to become the foundational settlement layer for a new wave of decentralized
  finance. This will require robust, scalable Layer 2 solutions that inherit Bitcoin''s
  security guarantees while offering EVM-like functionality (or similar battle-tested
  smart contract capabilities) for lending, trading, and other proven DeFi primitives.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Professionals, DeFi Developers, Bitcoin
  Maximalists interested in utility, and Investment Analysts** looking to understand
  the technical roadmap and market drivers behind the next phase of Bitcoin innovation.'
