  text: Stablecoins are not banks as we think about them in the modern conception

  text: It would be trivial for somebody like Goldman Sachs... to onboard somebody
    as a stablecoin user and say, when you leave the stablecoin with us, we will instantly

    They essentially can still create an interest-bearing stablecoin. Anybody who's
    got the right banking or money transfer licenses and a large enough asset manager
    can create an interesting-bearing stablecoin. Small entities cannot do this.
  topic: regulation/business
- impact_reason: Provides crucial regulatory nuance, showing that not all MMF-like
    products are securities, offering a path for stablecoins to avoid the restrictive
    securities framework.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think the reason that people jump to the securities framework for the thing
    is because the analogy that they have in their head is a money market fund. And
    I will remind people that yes, asset manager-issued 1940 government money market
    funds and prime funds are securities. But some interesting trivia nuggets, there
    are ways to issue bank-issued money market funds, which are not securities. Your
    savings account is not a security.
  topic: regulation/technology
- impact_reason: Offers a sophisticated definition of stablecoins as an 'honest version'
    of narrow banking, emphasizing their safety profile (T-bill backing) compared
    to fractional reserve banking.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: what stablecoins have done is actually what I would call the honest version
    of that [narrow banking], which is to say, I'm going to take deposits. And I'm
    not just going to park the bit the Fed... But what I am going to do is only make
    risk-free loans to the federal government with that money. So again, it is basically
    taking a money market fund and putting it inside a payments wrapper.
  topic: technology/defi
- impact_reason: This provides a clear, practical use case for regulated stablecoins
    (backed by T-bills in a bankruptcy-remote structure) as a superior alternative
    to uninsured commercial bank deposits for high-turnover small businesses, directly
    addressing systemic risk (bank failures) and lack of yield.

  text: This person being able to use stablecoins instead that are purely backed by
    T-bills and a bankruptcy-remote vehicle, massive improvement. He should use that
    10 times out of 10 if you can do it in a secure way over using an uninsured bank
    account because he's essentially making a free loan to a bank in a credit-risky

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Why a U.S. Ban on Yield-Bearing Stablecoins Would Help
  ''Too Big to Fail'' Banks - Ep. 840


  This episode of Unchained features host Laura Shin in conversation with **Austin
  Campbell**, Professor and Founder/Managing Partner of Zero and Knowledge Consulting,
  focusing on the contentious provisions within the proposed U.S. stablecoin bill,
  specifically the ban on interest-bearing stablecoins.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **cryptocurrency regulation**, specifically the implications
  of the U.S. Senate''s stablecoin legislation (the Clarity Act). The core theme is
  how banning yield on stablecoins functions as **regulatory capture** favoring incumbent,
  "Too Big to Fail" (TBTF) banks over decentralized finance (DeFi) and consumer choice.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Stablecoin Function vs. Banking:** Stablecoins are fundamentally different
  from banks; they are designed to be boring—holding reserves (like T-bills) and not
  losing value—whereas banks engage in fractional reserve lending against credit-risky
  borrowers.

  *   **Narrow Banking Analogy:** Stablecoin issuers function as an "honest version"
  of narrow banks, taking deposits and only making risk-free loans to the government,
  contrasting sharply with traditional commercial banking models.

  *   **Securities Classification Nuance:** Interest-bearing stablecoins are not necessarily
  securities under existing law. Bank-issued money market funds and savings accounts
  are exempt from securities laws, suggesting that stablecoins operating under stringent
  banking supervision could also avoid this classification.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Consumer Disadvantage:** Banning yield forces U.S. consumers to accept near-zero
  returns on dollar holdings, while offshore or institutional products (like tokenized
  money market funds for accredited investors) continue to earn interest on the same
  underlying Treasury assets.

  *   **Anti-Competitive Barrier:** The ban disproportionately harms smaller stablecoin
  issuers, as large incumbents (like Goldman Sachs) can circumvent the restriction
  by instantly wrapping stablecoin holdings into their existing money market fund
  platforms, effectively creating a yield-bearing product for themselves.

  *   **Tether''s Profit Motive:** The push for the ban is heavily influenced by existing
  stablecoin issuers (like Tether, which made $13B in 2024 profits) whose business
  models rely on capturing the interest earned on reserves rather than passing it
  to users.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Austin Campbell:** Guest expert providing the critical analysis of the legislation''s
  structure and impact.

  *   **Tether:** Mentioned as the primary beneficiary of the ban, as it allows them
  to retain the interest income from reserves.

  *   **Goldman Sachs/Large Asset Managers:** Highlighted as entities capable of bypassing
  the ban via existing money market fund infrastructure, thus consolidating market
  power.

  *   **Community Banks:** Positioned as the primary lobbying force behind the ban,
  arguing for protection against competition, despite their own potentially risky
  lending practices.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   **Lobbying Influence:** The ban originated primarily from lobbying by banking
  associations fearing deposit flight, despite evidence suggesting most stablecoin
  demand is currently non-U.S. or crypto-native.

  *   **Geopolitical Risk (Eurodollar Parallel):** Banning yield explicitly favors
  non-U.S. stablecoin issuers, pushing dollar activity offshore. This risks recreating
  the opaque Eurodollar market dynamics that caused systemic issues in 2008, reducing
  U.S. oversight of dollar flows.

  *   **Age Divergence in Congress:** The discussion noted that Democrats voting to
  advance the bill were significantly younger on average than those who voted against
  it, suggesting older lawmakers are more protective of the pre-internet, localized
  banking model.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that if the ban passes, the U.S. risks enshrining an outdated,
  parochial banking model that dampens American competitiveness in digital finance.
  It will lead to a bifurcated market where U.S. users receive inferior returns compared
  to international counterparts and accredited investors, while simultaneously strengthening
  the market dominance of the largest financial institutions.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **crypto industry professionals, financial regulators,
  fintech investors, and policy analysts** concerned with the intersection of digital
  assets, banking regulation, and antitrust issues.'
