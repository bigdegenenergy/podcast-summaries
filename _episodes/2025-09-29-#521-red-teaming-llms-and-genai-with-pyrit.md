summary: '## Podcast Summary: #521: Red Teaming LLMs and GenAI with PyRIT


  This episode of TalkPythonemy features **Tory Westerhof** (Lead of Operations for
  Microsoft''s AI Red Team) and **Roman Lutz** (Engineer on the AI Red Team tooling
  side) discussing the emerging security landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs)
  and Generative AI (GenAI). The core focus is on the new attack surfaces created
  when LLMs are connected to tools and external data, and the necessity of proactive,
  engineering-driven security testing, exemplified by their open-source framework,
  **PyRIT** (pronounced "Pirate").


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **AI Security and Red Teaming for LLMs and Agentic Systems**.
  Specific topics covered include:

  *   The evolution of the attack surface when LLMs interact with APIs, tools, and
  untrusted data.

  *   Analysis of key vulnerabilities from the **OWASP Top 10 for LLMs**, particularly
  **Prompt Injection** (direct and indirect).

  *   The role of proactive security testing (Red Teaming) in the AI development lifecycle.

  *   The introduction and utility of **PyRIT**, a Python framework designed to automate
  and scale LLM security testing.

  *   The concept of **Excessive Agency** and agentic harms.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Indirect Prompt Injection as the Evolving Threat:** This vector, where malicious
  instructions are hidden within data sources (like documents or emails) that the
  LLM processes, is seen as the most rapidly evolving and complex threat, expanding
  the attack surface far beyond direct user prompts.

  *   **PyRIT for Scalable Testing:** PyRIT is designed to move security testing from
  a one-time audit to an **everyday engineering practice** by automating the generation
  and execution of adversarial prompts against LLM systems, allowing teams to test
  defenses continuously.

  *   **Security by Design for Agency:** Securing agentic systems requires crisp definitions
  of **trust lines**, limited data access, and strict controls over which functions/tools
  an agent can use and on what specific data, mitigating risks like excessive agency.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Mismatch in AI Adoption Expectations:** Many enterprise AI projects fail not
  due to technology limitations, but due to a mismatch between C-suite expectations
  (full automation) and the current reality, often ignoring the critical role of user
  adoption and change management.

  *   **The Value of Paid/Tiered Models:** There is a significant difference in security
  and performance between free-tier AI tools and top-tier paid platforms; businesses
  must account for this disparity when implementing solutions.

  *   **Security as a Prerequisite for Adoption:** For agentic AI to be widely and
  safely adopted across various business domains (beyond developer tooling), robust
  safety and security measures must be prioritized to build necessary trust.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Tory Westerhof & Roman Lutz (Microsoft AI Red Team):** The guests who lead
  the effort to secure Microsoft''s high-risk GenAI systems and developed PyRIT.

  *   **OWASP:** Referenced for establishing the foundational "Top 10" list for LLM
  vulnerabilities, providing a common language for risk assessment.

  *   **Sentry & Agency:** Sponsors mentioned, highlighting the industry need for
  observability tools (Sentry''s AI Agent Monitoring) and agent orchestration layers
  (Agency).


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly suggests that the industry is moving toward **continuous,
  automated security validation** for AI systems, mirroring established software development
  practices. As LLMs become more integrated into tech stacks (becoming "APIs" themselves),
  the threat surface will continue to expand, necessitating interdisciplinary teams
  (including legal and domain experts) to model threats effectively. The focus will
  shift from securing the model itself to securing the **entire agentic system** it
  operates within.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI/ML Engineers, Security Professionals (Red
  Teamers, AppSec), DevOps Engineers, and Technical Product Managers** involved in
  building, deploying, or securing applications that integrate LLMs or agentic workflows.'
