  text: When NEAR launched, there weren't that many strong L1s, and then every three
    months, it seems like a new L1 was being created, being spun up. So when Sui launches,
    that's going to take a little bit of attention from NEAR. When Aptos chain, you
    know, when you see all these chains being launched, it's going to steal some attention
    here.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Bitcoin Falling: New TRUMP Tariff Destroying
  Crypto Prices


  This 66-minute episode of *Discover Crypto* hosted by DZ, featuring guests Josh
  and TJ, primarily focused on the immediate market reaction to political news, specifically
  former President Trump''s proposed tariffs, while also covering broader macroeconomic
  trends, technical analysis of Bitcoin, and significant developments in the AI sector.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area:**

  The discussion centered on **Cryptocurrency Markets (Bitcoin and Altcoins)**, heavily
  influenced by **Macroeconomics and Geopolitics** (specifically US trade policy under
  potential Trump administration scenarios). A significant secondary focus was the
  disruptive potential of **Generative AI video technology**.


  **2. Key Technical Insights:**

  *   **Bitcoin Price Action & Liquidation Models:** The market experienced a sharp,
  short-term pullback following Trump''s tariff tweets, but analysts viewed the drop
  to $107k (and subsequent stabilization around $110k) as a "healthy little correction,"
  noting that liquidations were opening up healthily toward $111k–$112k resistance.

  *   **M2 Money Supply Correlation:** Bitcoin''s recent price action was shown to
  be tracking almost perfectly with the M2 money supply, suggesting the recent dip
  aligned precisely with a sharp drop in money supply figures.

  *   **Potential Breakout Structure:** Technical charts suggested Bitcoin was forming
  a structure similar to late 2023/early 2024, indicating potential for a significant
  upward "coiling" and breakout, possibly after one final retest of support levels
  (around $105k).


  **3. Market/Investment Angle:**

  *   **Altcoin Season Potential:** If Bitcoin dominance weakens and rejects a key
  level above 3k (likely referring to a dominance percentage), a significant move
  to the upside for altcoins is anticipated.

  *   **Corporate Balance Sheet Adoption:** The purchase of small amounts of Bitcoin
  (e.g., a Swedish firm buying 4 BTC causing a 37% stock pump) and larger commitments
  (e.g., a Chinese EV seller planning to buy 1,000 BTC) signal increasing institutional
  validation and potential for stock price appreciation for companies adopting BTC.

  *   **Dollar Weakness as a Bull Case:** The core long-term bullish thesis remains
  that continuous fiat money printing across administrations guarantees the depreciation
  of the dollar, making assets like Bitcoin the necessary "exit strategy" and driving
  BTC toward $200k and eventually $1 million.


  **4. Notable Companies/People:**

  *   **Donald Trump:** His proposed 50% tariff on EU imports and 25% levy on non-US-made
  iPhones caused immediate risk-off sentiment and market chaos.

  *   **Janet Yellen:** Her subsequent comments touting trade deals appeared to counteract
  the yield-lowering effect of Trump’s tariff news, causing the 10-year Treasury yield
  to rebound after an initial drop.

  *   **NEAR Protocol:** Mentioned as a strong Layer-1 project with an integrated
  AI narrative, predicted to easily reclaim all-time highs within six months.

  *   **Google V03:** Highlighted as a major technological leap in generative AI video,
  capable of creating hyper-realistic, prompted scenes, signaling massive disruption
  to creative industries.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  *   **Trump''s Trade War as Rate Manipulation:** The hosts speculated that Trump''s
  tariff threats might be a strategic move ("3D chess") designed to create recessionary
  fears, thereby pressuring the Federal Reserve (Powell) into cutting interest rates
  sooner than expected.

  *   **Texas Bitcoin Reserve:** Governor Greg Abbott''s move to establish a strategic
  Bitcoin reserve in Texas was noted as further evidence of governmental entities
  embracing digital assets.


  **6. Future Implications:**

  The conversation suggests a future where **AI video generation (like Google V03)
  becomes massively disruptive**, potentially leading to an explosion in deepfakes
  and propaganda, necessitating technological solutions (potentially leveraging projects
  like NEAR and Render) and raising serious IP/copyright concerns (referenced by Jack
  Dorsey''s stance on removing IP). On the financial front, the relentless printing
  of fiat currency ensures that **Bitcoin adoption as an inflation hedge and wealth
  preservation tool will only accelerate.**


  **7. Target Audience:**

  **Crypto Investors and Traders** actively managing short-term positions based on
  macro news, as well as **Tech Professionals and Strategists** interested in the
  intersection of AI, finance, and geopolitical risk.'
