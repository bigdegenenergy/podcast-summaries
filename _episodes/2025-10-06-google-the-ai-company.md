  extracted: so large that they keep pouring tens of billions of dollars into these
    competitors yeah plenty of other folks have made the sort of glib comment but
    there's merit to hey as flatfooted as Google was when Chatship T happened if the
    outcome of this is they avoid a Microsoft level distraction and damage to their
    business from a US federal court monopoly judgment worth it well there's a funny
    meme here that you could draw you know that meme of someone pushing the domino
    and it knocking over some big wall later yeah there's the domino of Ilya leaving
    Google to start open AI and the downstream effect is Google is not broken up yeah
    right exactly actually saves Google it actually saves Google it's totally wild
    totally wild all right so here's the business today over the last 12 months Google
    has generated three hundred and seventy billion dollars in revenue on the earnings
    side they've generated a hundred and forty billion over the last 12 months which
    is more profit than any other tech company and the only company in the world with
    more earnings is Saudi or Ramco let's not forget Google is the best business ever
    and we also made the point at the end of the health a bit episode even in the
    midst of all of this AI era and everything that's happened over the last 10 years
    the last five years Google's court business has continued to grow five X since
    the end of our alphabet episode in 2015 2016 yeah market cap Google surge past
    their old peak of two trillion and just hit that three trillion mark earlier this
    month they're the fourth most valuable company in the world behind Nvidia Microsoft
    and Apple it's just crazy on their balance sheet actually think this is pretty
    interesting I normally don't look at balance sheet as a part of this exercise
    but it's useful and here's why in this case they have 95 billion in cash and marketable
    securities and I was about to stop there and make the point wow look how much
    cash and resources they have actually surprised it's not more so it used to be
    a hundred and forty billion in twenty twenty one and over the last four years
    they've massively shift from this mode of accumulating cash to deploying cash
    and a huge part of that has been the capex of the AI data center build out so
    they're very much playing offense in the way that met a Microsoft and Amazon are
    into playing that capex but the thing that I can't quite figure out is the largest
    part of that was actually buybacks and they started paying a dividend so if you're
    not a finance person the way to read into that is yes we still need a lot of cash
    for investing in the future of AI and data centers but we still actually had way
    more cash than we needed and we decided to distribute that to shareholders yeah
    that's crazy best business of all time right that illustrates what a crazy business
    their core search ads businesses if they're saying the most capital intense race
    in business history is happening right now we intend to win it yep and we have
    tons of extra cash lying around on top of what we think plus a safety cushion
    for investing in that capex race yeah yes well so there are two businesses that
    are worth looking at here one is Gemini to try to figure out what's happening
    there and two is a brief history of Google Cloud I want to tell you the cloud
    numbers today but it's probably worth actually understanding how did we get here
    on cloud yep first on Gemini because this is Google and they have I think the
    most obfuscated financials of any of the companies we've studied they anger be
    the most in being able to hide the ball in their financial statements of course
    we don't know Gemini specific revenue what we do know is there are over 150 million
    paying subscribers to the Google one bundle most of that is on a very low tier
    that's on like the five dollar a month ten dollar a month the AI stuff kicks in
    on the twenty dollar a month tier where you get the premium AI features but I
    think that's a very small fraction of the hundred and fifty million today I think
    that's what I'm on but two things to know one it's growing quickly that hundred
    and fifty million is growing almost 50 percent year over year but two is Google
    has a subscription bundle that a hundred and fifty million people are subscribed
    to and so I've kind of had it in my head that AI doesn't have a future as a business
    model that people pay money for that it has to be ad supported like search but
    hey that's not nothing that's like a that's almost half of America I mean how
    many subscribers does Netflix have Netflix is in the hundreds of millions yeah
    Spotify is now a quarter billion something like that yeah we now live in a world
    where there are real scaled consumer subscription services I owe this insight
    to Shishir Morodo we chatted actually last night because I named dropped him in
    the last episode and then he heard it and so we reached out we talked and that's
    made me do a 180 I used to think if you're going to charge for something your
    total address will market shrunk by 90 to 99 percent but he kind of has this point
    that if you build a really compelling bundle and Google has the digital assets
    to build a compelling bundle oh my goodness YouTube premium NFL Sunday ticket
    yes stuff in the play store YouTube music all the Google one storage stuff they
    could put AI in that bundle and figure out through clever bundle economics a way
    to make a paid AI product that actually reaches a huge number of paying subscribers
    totally so we really can't figure out how much money Gemini makes right now probably
    not profitable anyway so what's the point of even analyzing it yep but okay tell
    us the cloud story so we intentionally did not include cloud in our alphabet episode
    Google part two effectively Google part two yes because it is a new product and
    now very successful one within Google that was started during the same time period
    as all the other ones that we talked about during Google part two but it's so
    strategic for AI yes it is a lot more strategic now in hindsight than it looked
    when they launched it so just quick background on it it started as Google App
    Engine it was away in 2008 for people to quickly spin up a backend for a web or
    soon after a mobile app it was a platform as a service so you had to do things
    in this very narrow Googley way it was very opinionated you had to use this SDK
    you had to write it in Python or Java you had to deploy exactly the way they wanted
    you to deploy it was not a thing where they would say hey developer you can do
    anything you want just use our infrastructure it was opinionated super different
    than what AWS was doing at the time and what they're still doing today which the
    whole eventually realized was right which is cloud should be infrastructure as
    a service even Microsoft pivoted Azure to this reasonably quickly where it was
    like you want some storage we got storage for you you want a VM we got a VM for
    you you want some compute you want a database we got to fundamental building blocks
    so eventually Google launches their own infrastructures service in 2012 took four
    years they launched Google compute engine that they would later rebrand Google
    cloud platform that's the name of the business today the knock on Google is that
    they could never figure out how to possibly interface with the enterprise their
    core business they made really great products for people to use that they loved
    polishing they made them all as self service possible and in the way they made
    money it was from advertisers and let's be honest there's no other choice but
    to use Google search right it didn't necessarily need to have a great enterprise
    experience for their advertising customers because they were going to come anyway
    right so they've got this self serve experience meanwhile the cloud is a knife
    fight these are commodities all about the enterprise it's the lowest possible
    price and it's all about enterprise relationships and clever ways to bundle and
    being able to deliver a full solution you say solution I hear grows margin yes
    but yes so Google out of their natural habitat in this domain and early on they
    didn't want to give away any crown jewels they viewed their infrastructure as
    this is our secret thing we don't want to let anybody else use it and the best
    software tools that we have on it that we've written for ourselves like big table
    or board how we run Google or dist belief these are not services that we're making
    available on Google cloud yeah these are competitive advantages yes and then they
    hired the former president of Oracle Thomas Kerian yes and everything kind of
    changed so 2017 two years before he comes in they had four billion dollars in
    revenue 10 years into running this business 2018 is their first very clever strategic
    decision they launch Kubernetes the big insight here is if we make it more portable
    for developers to move their applications to other clouds the world is kind of
    wanting multi cloud here right where the third place player we don't have anything
    to lose yes so we can offer this tool and kind of counter position against AWS
    and Azure we shift the developer paradigm to use these containers they orchestrate
    on our platform and then you know we have a great service to manage it for you
    it was very smart so this kind of becomes one of the pillars of their strategy
    is you want multi cloud we're going to make that easy and you can sure choose
    AWS or Azure to it's going to be great so David as you said the former president
    of Oracle Thomas Kerian is hired in late 2018 you couldn't ask for a better person
    who understands the needs of the enterprise than the former president of Oracle
    this shows up in revenue growth right away in 2020 they crossed 13 billion in
    revenue which was nearly tripling in three years they hired like 10,000 people
    into the go-to-market organization I'm not exaggerating that and that's on a base
    of 150 people when he came in most of which were seated in California not regionally
    distributed throughout the world the funniest thing is Google kind of was a cloud
    company all along they had the best engineers building this amazing infrastructure
    right they had the products they had the infrastructure they just didn't have
    the go-to-market organization right and the productization was all like Google
    it was like for us for engineers they didn't really build things that let enterprises
    build the way they wanted to build this all changes 2022 they hit 26 billion in
    revenue 2023 they're like a real viable third cloud they also flipped a profitability
    in 2023 and today they're over $50 billion in annual revenue run rate it's growing
    30% year over year they're the fastest growing of the major cloud providers 5x
    and 5 years and it's really three things it's finding religion on how to actually
    serve the enterprise it's leaning into this multi cloud strategy and actually
    giving enterprise developers what they want and three AI has been such a good
    tailwind for all hyper scalars because these workloads all need to run in the
    cloud because it's giant amounts of data and giant amount of compute and energy
    but in Google Cloud you can use TPUs which they make a ton of and everyone else
    is desperately begging Nvidia for allocations to GPUs so if you're willing to
    not use CUDA and build on Google Stack they have an abundant amount of TPUs for
    you
  text: the opportunity is so large that they keep pouring tens of billions of dollars

    I think that's what I'm on but two things to know one it's growing quickly that
    hundred and fifty million is growing almost 50 percent year over year but two
    is Google has a subscription bundle that a hundred and fifty million people are
    subscribed to and so I've kind of had it in my head that AI doesn't have a future
    as a business model that people pay money for that it has to be ad supported like
    search but hey that's not nothing that's like a that's almost half of America
    I mean how many subscribers does Netflix have Netflix is in the hundreds of millions
    yeah Spotify is now a quarter billion something like that yeah we now live in
    a world where there are real scaled consumer subscription services I owe this
    insight to Shishir Morodo we chatted actually last night because I named dropped
    him in the last episode and then he heard it and so we reached out we talked and
    that's made me do a 180 I used to think if you're going to charge for something
    your total address will market shrunk by 90 to 99 percent but he kind of has this
    point that if you build a really compelling bundle and Google has the digital
    assets to build a compelling bundle oh my goodness YouTube premium NFL Sunday
    ticket yes stuff in the play store YouTube music all the Google one storage stuff
    they could put AI in that bundle and figure out through clever bundle economics
    a way to make a paid AI product that actually reaches a huge number of paying
    subscribers totally so we really can't figure out how much money Gemini makes
    right now probably not profitable anyway so what's the point of even analyzing
    it yep but okay tell us the cloud story so we intentionally did not include cloud
    in our alphabet episode Google part two effectively Google part two yes because
    it is a new product and now very successful one within Google that was started
    during the same time period as all the other ones that we talked about during
    Google part two but it's so strategic for AI yes it is a lot more strategic now
    in hindsight than it looked when they launched it so just quick background on
    it it started as Google App Engine it was away in 2008 for people to quickly spin
    up a backend for a web or soon after a mobile app it was a platform as a service
    so you had to do things in this very narrow Googley way it was very opinionated
    you had to use this SDK you had to write it in Python or Java you had to deploy
    exactly the way they wanted you to deploy it was not a thing where they would
    say hey developer you can do anything you want just use our infrastructure it
    was opinionated super different than what AWS was doing at the time and what they're
    still doing today which the whole eventually realized was right which is cloud
    should be infrastructure as a service even Microsoft pivoted Azure to this reasonably
    quickly where it was like you want some storage we got storage for you you want
    a VM we got a VM for you you want some compute you want a database we got to fundamental
    building blocks so eventually Google launches their own infrastructures service
    in 2012 took four years they launched Google compute engine that they would later
    rebrand Google cloud platform that's the name of the business today the knock
    on Google is that they could never figure out how to possibly interface with the
    enterprise their core business they made really great products for people to use
    that they loved polishing they made them all as self service possible and in the
    way they made money it was from advertisers and let's be honest there's no other
    choice but to use Google search right it didn't necessarily need to have a great
    enterprise experience for their advertising customers because they were going
    to come anyway right so they've got this self serve experience meanwhile the cloud
    is a knife fight these are commodities all about the enterprise it's the lowest
    possible price and it's all about enterprise relationships and clever ways to
    bundle and being able to deliver a full solution you say solution I hear grows
    margin yes but yes so Google out of their natural habitat in this domain and early
    on they didn't want to give away any crown jewels they viewed their infrastructure
    as this is our secret thing we don't want to let anybody else use it and the best
    software tools that we have on it that we've written for ourselves like big table
    or board how we run Google or dist belief these are not services that we're making
    available on Google cloud yeah these are competitive advantages yes and then they
    hired the former president of Oracle Thomas Kerian yes and everything kind of
    changed so 2017 two years before he comes in they had four billion dollars in
    revenue 10 years into running this business 2018 is their first very clever strategic
    decision they launch Kubernetes the big insight here is if we make it more portable
    for developers to move their applications to other clouds the world is kind of
    wanting multi cloud here right where the third place player we don't have anything
    to lose yes so we can offer this tool and kind of counter position against AWS
    and Azure we shift the developer paradigm to use these containers they orchestrate
    on our platform and then you know we have a great service to manage it for you
    it was very smart so this kind of becomes one of the pillars of their strategy
    is you want multi cloud we're going to make that easy and you can sure choose
    AWS or Azure to it's going to be great so David as you said the former president
    of Oracle Thomas Kerian is hired in late 2018 you couldn't ask for a better person
    who understands the needs of the enterprise than the former president of Oracle
    this shows up in revenue growth right away in 2020 they crossed 13 billion in
    revenue which was nearly tripling in three years they hired like 10,000 people
    into the go-to-market organization I'm not exaggerating that and that's on a base
    of 150 people when he came in most of which were seated in California not regionally
    distributed throughout the world the funniest thing is Google kind of was a cloud
    company all along they had the best engineers building this amazing infrastructure
    right they had the products they had the infrastructure they just didn't have
    the go-to-market organization right and the productization was all like Google
    it was like for us for engineers they didn't really build things that let enterprises
    build the way they wanted to build this all changes 2022 they hit 26 billion in
    revenue 2023 they're like a real viable third cloud they also flipped a profitability
    in 2023 and today they're over $50 billion in annual revenue run rate it's growing
    30% year over year they're the fastest growing of the major cloud providers 5x
    and 5 years and it's really three things it's finding religion on how to actually
    serve the enterprise it's leaning into this multi cloud strategy and actually
    giving enterprise developers what they want and three AI has been such a good
    tailwind for all hyper scalars because these workloads all need to run in the
    cloud because it's giant amounts of data and giant amount of compute and energy
    but in Google Cloud you can use TPUs which they make a ton of and everyone else
    is desperately begging Nvidia for allocations to GPUs so if you're willing to
    not use CUDA and build on Google Stack they have an abundant amount of TPUs for
    you.

    a i overviews versus the competitive set of anthropic open a i perplexity groc
    met a i etc scale economies for sure even more so in a i than traditionally in
    tech yeah they're just way better i mean look they're amortizing the cost of model
    training across every google search i'm sure it's some super distilled down model
    that's actually happening for a i overviews but think about how many inference
    tokens are generated for the other model companies and how many inference tokens
    are generated by jemen i they just are amortizing that fixed training costs over
    a giant giant amount of inference that i saw some crazy chart will send it out
    to email subscribers in april of twenty four google was processing ten trillion
    tokens across all their surfaces in april of twenty five that was almost five
    hundred trillion wow that's a fifty x increase in one year of the number of tokens
    that they're vending out across google services through inference and between
    april of twenty five and june twenty five it went from a little under five hundred
    trillion to a little under one quadrillion tokens technically nine hundred and
    eighty trillion but they are now because it's later in the summer definitely sending
    out maybe even multiple quadrillion tokens wow wow so among all the other obvious
    scale economies things of amortizing all the cost of their hardware they are amortizing
    the cost of training runs over a massive amount of value creation yeah scale economies
    must be the biggest one i find switching costs to be relatively low i use jemen
    i for some stuff then it's really easy to switch away that probably stops being
    the case when it's personal a i to the point that you're talking about integrating
    with your calendar and your mail and all that stuff yeah the switching costs have
    not really come out yet in a i products although i expect they will yes they have
    within the enterprise for sure yep network economies i don't think if anyone else
    is a jemen i user it makes it better for me because they are sucking up the whole
    internet whether anyone's participating or not yeah agree i'm sure a i companies
    will develop network economies over time i can think of ways it could work but
    yeah right now no arguably for the foundational model companies can't think of
    obvious reasons right now where does Hamilton put distribution because that's
    a thing that they have right now that no one else has despite chat gbt having
    the clean x brand google distribution is still unbelievable i don't know is that
    a cornered resource cornered resource i guess yeah definitely of that yeah google
    search is a cornered resource for sure certainly don't have counter positioning
    they're getting counter positioned yeah i don't think they have process power
    unless they were like coming up with the next transformer reliably but i don't
    think we're necessarily seeing that there's great research being done at a bunch
    of different labs branding they have yeah branding is a funny one right well i
    was going to say it's a little bit to my bear case point about they're the incumbent
    it cuts both ways but i think it's net positive yeah probably for most people
    they trust google yeah they probably don't trust these who knows a i companies
    but i trust google i bet that's actually stronger than any downsides as long as
    they're willing to still release stuff on the cutting edge yeah so to sum it up
    its scale economies is the biggest one it's branding and it's a cornered resource
    and potential for switching costs in the future yep sounds right to me but it's
    telling that it's not all of them you know in search it was like very obviously
    all of them or most of them yep quite telling well i'll tell you after hours and
    hours spending multiple months learning about this company my contestants when
    i boil it all down is just that this is the most fascinating example of the innovators
    dilemma ever i mean laryan Sergei control the company they have been quoted repeatedly
    saying that they would rather go bankrupt than lose it a i will they really if
    a i isn't as good a business as search and it kind of feels like of course it
    will be of course it has to be it's just because of the sheer amount of value
    creation but if it's not and they're choosing between two outcomes one is fulfilling
    our mission of organizing the world's information and making it universally accessible
    and useful and having the most profitable tech company in the world which one
    wins because if it's just the mission they should be way more aggressive on AI
    mode than they are right now and full flip over to Gemini it's a really hard needle
    of thread i'm actually very impressed at how they're managing to currently protect
    the core franchise but it might be one of these things where it's being eroded
    away at the foundation in a way that just somehow isn't showing up in the financials
    yet i don't know yep i totally agree and in fact perhaps influenced by you i think
    my quintessence is a version of that too i think if you look at all the big tech
    companies google as unlikely as it seems given how things started is probably
    doing the best job of trying to thread the needle with AI right now and that is
    incredibly commendable to soon dar and their leadership they are making hard decisions
    like we're unifying deep mind and brain we're consolidating its dandardizing on
    one model and we're going to ship this stuff real fast while at the same time
    not making rash decisions hard rapid but not rash you know yes and obviously we're
    still in early innings of all this going on and we'll see in 10 years where it
    all ends up yeah being tasked with being the steward of a mission and the steward
    of a franchise with public company shareholders is a hard dual mission and soon
    dar and the company is handling it remarkably well especially given where they
    were five years ago yep and i think this will be one of the most fascinating examples
    in history to watch it play out totally agree well that concludes our google series
    for now yes all right let's do some carve outs all right let's do some carve well
    first off we have a very very fun announcement to share with you all the NFL called
    us we're going to the Super Bowl baby acquired is going to the Super Bowl this
    is so cool that's the craziest thing ever the NFL is hosting a innovation summit
    that we get the Super Bowl the Friday before Super Bowl Sunday the Super Bowl
    is going to be in San Francisco this year in February and so it's only natural
    coming back to San Francisco with the Super Bowl that the NFL should do an innovation
    summit yep and we're gonna host it that's right so the Friday before there's going
    to be some great onstage interviews and programming most of you you know we can't
    fit millions of people in a tidy auditorium in San Francisco the week of the Super
    Bowl when every other venue has tons of stuff too so there'll be an opportunity
    to watch that streaming online and as we get closer to that date in February we
    will make sure that you all know a way that you can tune in and watch the MCI
    interviewing and festivities at hand Super Bowl week it's going to be an incredible
    incredible day leading up to an incredible Sunday yes well speaking of sport my
    carve out is I finally went and saw f1 it is great I highly recommend anyone go
    see it whether you're an f1 fan or not it is just beautiful cinema I mean did
    you see it in the theater or I did see in the theater yeah wow I unfortunately
    missed the iMacs window but it was great it's my first time meeting a movie theater
    in a while and whether you watch it at home or whether you're watching the theater
    I recommend the theater but it's gonna be a great surround sound experience wherever
    you are oh I haven't been to the movie theater since the era's tour which I think
    is just more about the current state of my family life with two young children
    yes my second one so if you're going to laugh is the travel pro suitcase this
    is the brand that pilots and flight attendants use right maybe I think I've seen
    some of them use it usually they use something higher end like a Briggs and Riley
    or a to me or you know travel pro is not the most high end suitcase but I bought
    two really big ones for some international travel that we were doing with my two-year-old
    toddler and I must say they're robust the wheels glide really well they're really
    smooth they have all the features you would want they're soft shell so you can
    like really jam it full of stuff but it's also a thick amount of protection so
    even if you do jam it full of stuff it's probably not gonna break this is approximately
    the most budget suitcase you could buy I mean I'm looking at the big honken international
    check bag version it's $416 on Amazon right now I've seen it cheaper they have
    great sales pretty often everything about this suitcase checked lots of boxes
    for me and I completely thought I would be the person buying the Ramoa suitcase
    or the something very high end and this is just perfect so I think I may be investing
    in more travel pro suitcases more travel pro nice well I mean hey look for family
    travel you don't want nice stuff yeah I mean I bought it thinking like I'll just
    get some crappy for this trip but it's been great I don't understand why I wouldn't
    have a full lineup of travel pro gear so this is my like budget pick gone right
    that I highly recommend for all of you I love how acquired is turning into the
    wire cutter here that's it for me today great all right I have two carbats I have
    one carbought and then I have a update in my ongoing Google Carvalt saga but first
    my actual car valve it is the glue guys podcast oh it's great those guys are awesome
    so great our buddy Ravi Gupta partner at Sequoia and his buddies Shane Badiay
    the former basketball player and Alex Smith the former quarterback for the 49ers
    and the Kansas City Chiefs and the Redskins their dynamic is so great they have
    so much fun half of their episodes like us are just them then half of their episodes
    are with guests bed and I we went on it a couple weeks ago that was really fun
    when we were on it we were talking about this dynamic of some episodes do better
    than others and pressure for episodes one not in the guys brought up this interview
    they did with a guy named right Thompson and they said like like this is an episode
    it's got like 5,000 listens nobody's listen to it it's so good and the mentality
    that we have about it is not that we're embarrassed that nobody listen to it it's
    that we feel sorry for the people who have not get listened to it because it's
    so good it's like that is the way to think about that's great your episode so
    here you are you're giving everyone the gift of giving everyone the gift because
    I then I was like all right well I got to go listen to this episode right Thompson
    I didn't know anything about him before I probably read his work in magazines
    over the years without realizing it he's the coolest dude he has the same accent
    as Bill Gurley so listening to him sounds like listening to like Bill Gurley instead
    of being a VC only wrote about sports and basically dedicated his whole life to
    understanding the mentality and psychology of athletes and coaches it's so cool
    it's so cool it's a great episode highly highly highly recommend all right legitimately
    I'm queuing that up right now great that's my carve out and then my ongoing family
    video gaming saga in google part one I said I was debating between the switch
    two and the steam deck well that's right first you got the steam deck because
    you decided your daughter actually wasn't old enough to play video games with
    you so you just got the thing for you the update was I went with the steam deck
    for that reason I thought if it's just for me it would be more ideal I have an
    update you also got a switch no not yet okay okay but the most incredible thing
    happened my daughter notice this device that appeared in our house the dad plays
    every now and then and we were on vacation and I was playing the steam deck and
    she was like what's that well let me tell you and I was playing I've been playing
    this really cool indie old school style RPG called Sea of Stars it's like a chrono
    trigger style super Nintendo style RPG I'm playing it and my daughter comes to
    she's like can I watch you play and I'm like hell yeah you can watch me play I
    get to play video games and you sit here and snuggle with me and like you know
    amazing I get to play video games and call it parenting then it gets even better
    probably like two weeks ago we're playing and she's like hey dad can I try I'm
    like absolutely you can try I hand her the steam deck and it was the most incredible
    experience one of the most incredible experiences I've had as a parent because
    she doesn't know how to play video games and I'm watching her learn how to like
    use a joystick yeah yeah yeah super visibly I'm telling her what to do and then
    within two or three nights she got it she doesn't even know how to read yet but
    she figured it out it's awesome watching in real time and so now the last week
    it's turned to mostly she's playing and I'm like helping her asking questions
    are like well what do you think you should do here like you know should you go
    here I think this is the goal I think this is where it's so so fun so I think
    I might actually pretty soon her birthday's coming up end up getting a switch
    so that we can play you know together on the switch but unintentionally the steam
    deck was the gateway drug for my soon to be four-year-old daughter that's awesome
    there you go parent of the year right there getting to play video games and oh
    honey I got it I'll take it oh yeah I got it all right well listeners we have

    mode than they are right now and full flip over to Gemini it's a really hard needle
    of thread i'm actually very impressed at how they're managing to currently protect
    the core franchise but it might be one of these things where it's being eroded
    away at the foundation in a way that just somehow isn't showing up in the financials
    yet i don't know yep i totally agree and in fact perhaps influenced by you i think
    my quintessence is a version of that too i think if you look at all the big tech
    companies google as unlikely as it seems given how things started is probably
    doing the best job of trying to thread the needle with AI right now and that is
    incredibly commendable to soon dar and their leadership they are making hard decisions
    like we're unifying deep mind and brain we're consolidating its dandardizing on
    one model and we're going to ship this stuff real fast while at the same time
    not making rash decisions hard rapid but not rash you know yes and obviously we're
    still in early innings of all this going on and we'll see in 10 years where it
    all ends up yeah being tasked with being the steward of a mission and the steward
    of a franchise with public company shareholders is a hard dual mission and soon
    dar and the company is handling it remarkably well especially given where they
    were five years ago yep and i think this will be one of the most fascinating examples
    in history to watch it play out totally agree well that concludes our google series
    for now yes all right let's do some carve outs all right let's do some carve well
    first off we have a very very fun announcement to share with you all the NFL called
    us we're going to the Super Bowl baby acquired is going to the Super Bowl this
    is so cool that's the craziest thing ever the NFL is hosting a innovation summit
    that we get the Super Bowl the Friday before Super Bowl Sunday the Super Bowl
    is going to be in San Francisco this year in February and so it's only natural
    coming back to San Francisco with the Super Bowl that the NFL should do an innovation
    summit yep and we're gonna host it that's right so the Friday before there's going
    to be some great onstage interviews and programming most of you you know we can't
    fit millions of people in a tidy auditorium in San Francisco the week of the Super
    Bowl when every other venue has tons of stuff too so there'll be an opportunity
    to watch that streaming online and as we get closer to that date in February we
    will make sure that you all know a way that you can tune in and watch the MCI
    interviewing and festivities at hand Super Bowl week it's going to be an incredible
    incredible day leading up to an incredible Sunday yes well speaking of sport my
    carve out is I finally went and saw f1 it is great I highly recommend anyone go
    see it whether you're an f1 fan or not it is just beautiful cinema I mean did
    you see it in the theater or I did see in the theater yeah wow I unfortunately
    missed the iMacs window but it was great it's my first time meeting a movie theater
    in a while and whether you watch it at home or whether you're watching the theater
    I recommend the theater but it's gonna be a great surround sound experience wherever
    you are oh I haven't been to the movie theater since the era's tour which I think
    is just more about the current state of my family life with two young children
    yes my second one so if you're going to laugh is the travel pro suitcase this
    is the brand that pilots and flight attendants use right maybe I think I've seen
    some of them use it usually they use something higher end like a Briggs and Riley
    or a to me or you know travel pro is not the most high end suitcase but I bought
    two really big ones for some international travel that we were doing with my two-year-old
    toddler and I must say they're robust the wheels glide really well they're really
    smooth they have all the features you would want they're soft shell so you can
    like really jam it full of stuff but it's also a thick amount of protection so
    even if you do jam it full of stuff it's probably not gonna break this is approximately
    the most budget suitcase you could buy I mean I'm looking at the big honken international
    check bag version it's $416 on Amazon right now I've seen it cheaper they have
    great sales pretty often everything about this suitcase checked lots of boxes
    for me and I completely thought I would be the person buying the Ramoa suitcase
    or the something very high end and this is just perfect so I think I may be investing
    in more travel pro suitcases more travel pro nice well I mean hey look for family
    travel you don't want nice stuff yeah I mean I bought it thinking like I'll just
    get some crappy for this trip but it's been great I don't understand why I wouldn't
    have a full lineup of travel pro gear so this is my like budget pick gone right
    that I highly recommend for all of you I love how acquired is turning into the
    wire cutter here that's it for me today great all right I have two carbats I have
    one carbought and then I have a update in my ongoing Google Carvalt saga but first
    my actual car valve it is the glue guys podcast oh it's great those guys are awesome
    so great our buddy Ravi Gupta partner at Sequoia and his buddies Shane Badiay
    the former basketball player and Alex Smith the former quarterback for the 49ers
    and the Kansas City Chiefs and the Redskins their dynamic is so great they have
    so much fun half of their episodes like us are just them then half of their episodes
    are with guests bed and I we went on it a couple weeks ago that was really fun
    when we were on it we were talking about this dynamic of some episodes do better
    than others and pressure for episodes one not in the guys brought up this interview
    they did with a guy named right Thompson and they said like like this is an episode
    it's got like 5,000 listens nobody's listen to it it's so good and the mentality
    that we have about it is not that we're embarrassed that nobody listen to it it's
    that we feel sorry for the people who have not get listened to it because it's
    so good it's like that is the way to think about that's great your episode so
    here you are you're giving everyone the gift of giving everyone the gift because
    I then I was like all right well I got to go listen to this episode right Thompson
    I didn't know anything about him before I probably read his work in magazines
    over the years without realizing it he's the coolest dude he has the same accent
    as Bill Gurley so listening to him sounds like listening to like Bill Gurley instead
    of being a VC only wrote about sports and basically dedicated his whole life to
    understanding the mentality and psychology of athletes and coaches it's so cool
    it's so cool it's a great episode highly highly highly recommend all right legitimately
    I'm queuing that up right now great that's my carve out and then my ongoing family
    video gaming saga in google part one I said I was debating between the switch
    two and the steam deck well that's right first you got the steam deck because
    you decided your daughter actually wasn't old enough to play video games with
    you so you just got the thing for you the update was I went with the steam deck
    for that reason I thought if it's just for me it would be more ideal I have an
    update you also got a switch no not yet okay okay but the most incredible thing
    happened my daughter notice this device that appeared in our house the dad plays
    every now and then and we were on vacation and I was playing the steam deck and
    she was like what's that well let me tell you and I was playing I've been playing
    this really cool indie old school style RPG called Sea of Stars it's like a chrono
    trigger style super Nintendo style RPG I'm playing it and my daughter comes to
    she's like can I watch you play and I'm like hell yeah you can watch me play I
    get to play video games and you sit here and snuggle with me and like you know
    amazing I get to play video games and call it parenting then it gets even better
    probably like two weeks ago we're playing and she's like hey dad can I try I'm
    like absolutely you can try I hand her the steam deck and it was the most incredible
    experience one of the most incredible experiences I've had as a parent because
    she doesn't know how to play video games and I'm watching her learn how to like
    use a joystick yeah yeah yeah super visibly I'm telling her what to do and then
    within two or three nights she got it she doesn't even know how to read yet but
    she figured it out it's awesome watching in real time and so now the last week
    it's turned to mostly she's playing and I'm like helping her asking questions
    are like well what do you think you should do here like you know should you go
    here I think this is the goal I think this is where it's so so fun so I think
    I might actually pretty soon her birthday's coming up end up getting a switch
    so that we can play you know together on the switch but unintentionally the steam
    deck was the gateway drug for my soon to be four-year-old daughter that's awesome
    there you go parent of the year right there getting to play video games and oh
    honey I got it I'll take it oh yeah I got it all right well listeners we have

    history is happening right now we intend to win it yep and we have tons of extra
    cash lying around on top of what we think plus a safety cushion for investing
    in that capex race yeah yes well so there are two businesses that are worth looking
    at here one is Gemini to try to figure out what's happening there and two is a
    brief history of Google Cloud I want to tell you the cloud numbers today but it's
    probably worth actually understanding how did we get here on cloud yep first on
    Gemini because this is Google and they have I think the most obfuscated financials
    of any of the companies we've studied they anger be the most in being able to
    hide the ball in their financial statements of course we don't know Gemini specific
    revenue what we do know is there are over 150 million paying subscribers to the
    Google one bundle most of that is on a very low tier that's on like the five dollar
    a month ten dollar a month the AI stuff kicks in on the twenty dollar a month
    tier where you get the premium AI features but I think that's a very small fraction
    of the hundred and fifty million today I think that's what I'm on but two things
    to know one it's growing quickly that hundred and fifty million is growing almost
    50 percent year over year but two is Google has a subscription bundle that a hundred
    and fifty million people are subscribed to and so I've kind of had it in my head
    that AI doesn't have a future as a business model that people pay money for that
    it has to be ad supported like search but hey that's not nothing that's like a
    that's almost half of America I mean how many subscribers does Netflix have Netflix
    is in the hundreds of millions yeah Spotify is now a quarter billion something
    like that yeah we now live in a world where there are real scaled consumer subscription
    services I owe this insight to Shishir Morodo we chatted actually last night because
    I named dropped him in the last episode and then he heard it and so we reached
    out we talked and that's made me do a 180 I used to think if you're going to charge
    for something your total address will market shrunk by 90 to 99 percent but he
    kind of has this point that if you build a really compelling bundle and Google
    has the digital assets to build a compelling bundle oh my goodness YouTube premium
    NFL Sunday ticket yes stuff in the play store YouTube music all the Google one
    storage stuff they could put AI in that bundle and figure out through clever bundle
    economics a way to make a paid AI product that actually reaches a huge number
    of paying subscribers totally so we really can't figure out how much money Gemini
    makes right now probably not profitable anyway so what's the point of even analyzing
    it yep but okay tell us the cloud story so we intentionally did not include cloud
    in our alphabet episode Google part two effectively Google part two yes because
    it is a new product and now very successful one within Google that was started
    during the same time period as all the other ones that we talked about during
    Google part two but it's so strategic for AI yes it is a lot more strategic now
    in hindsight than it looked when they launched it so just quick background on
    it it started as Google App Engine it was away in 2008 for people to quickly spin
    up a backend for a web or soon after a mobile app it was a platform as a service
    so you had to do things in this very narrow Googley way it was very opinionated
    you had to use this SDK you had to write it in Python or Java you had to deploy
    exactly the way they wanted you to deploy it was not a thing where they would
    say hey developer you can do anything you want just use our infrastructure it
    was opinionated super different than what AWS was doing at the time and what they're
    still doing today which the whole eventually realized was right which is cloud
    should be infrastructure as a service even Microsoft pivoted Azure to this reasonably
    quickly where it was like you want some storage we got storage for you you want
    a VM we got a VM for you you want some compute you want a database we got to fundamental
    building blocks so eventually Google launches their own infrastructures service
    in 2012 took four years they launched Google compute engine that they would later
    rebrand Google cloud platform that's the name of the business today the knock
    on Google is that they could never figure out how to possibly interface with the
    enterprise their core business they made really great products for people to use
    that they loved polishing they made them all as self service possible and in the
    way they made money it was from advertisers and let's be honest there's no other
    choice but to use Google search right it didn't necessarily need to have a great
    enterprise experience for their advertising customers because they were going
    to come anyway right so they've got this self serve experience meanwhile the cloud
    is a knife fight these are commodities all about the enterprise it's the lowest
    possible price and it's all about enterprise relationships and clever ways to
    bundle and being able to deliver a full solution you say solution I hear grows
    margin yes but yes so Google out of their natural habitat in this domain and early
    on they didn't want to give away any crown jewels they viewed their infrastructure
    as this is our secret thing we don't want to let anybody else use it and the best
    software tools that we have on it that we've written for ourselves like big table
    or board how we run Google or dist belief these are not services that we're making
    available on Google cloud yeah these are competitive advantages yes and then they
    hired the former president of Oracle Thomas Kerian yes and everything kind of
    changed so 2017 two years before he comes in they had four billion dollars in
    revenue 10 years into running this business 2018 is their first very clever strategic
    decision they launch Kubernetes the big insight here is if we make it more portable
    for developers to move their applications to other clouds the world is kind of
    wanting multi cloud here right where the third place player we don't have anything
    to lose yes so we can offer this tool and kind of counter position against AWS
    and Azure we shift the developer paradigm to use these containers they orchestrate
    on our platform and then you know we have a great service to manage it for you
    it was very smart so this kind of becomes one of the pillars of their strategy
    is you want multi cloud we're going to make that easy and you can sure choose
    AWS or Azure to it's going to be great so David as you said the former president
    of Oracle Thomas Kerian is hired in late 2018 you couldn't ask for a better person
    who understands the needs of the enterprise than the former president of Oracle
    this shows up in revenue growth right away in 2020 they crossed 13 billion in
    revenue which was nearly tripling in three years they hired like 10,000 people
    into the go-to-market organization I'm not exaggerating that and that's on a base
    of 150 people when he came in most of which were seated in California not regionally
    distributed throughout the world the funniest thing is Google kind of was a cloud
    company all along they had the best engineers building this amazing infrastructure
    right they had the products they had the infrastructure they just didn't have
    the go-to-market organization right and the productization was all like Google
    it was like for us for engineers they didn't really build things that let enterprises
    build the way they wanted to build this all changes 2022 they hit 26 billion in
    revenue 2023 they're like a real viable third cloud they also flipped a profitability
    in 2023 and today they're over $50 billion in annual revenue run rate it's growing
    30% year over year they're the fastest growing of the major cloud providers 5x
    and 5 years and it's really three things it's finding religion on how to actually
    serve the enterprise it's leaning into this multi cloud strategy and actually
    giving enterprise developers what they want and three AI has been such a good
    tailwind for all hyper scalars because these workloads all need to run in the
    cloud because it's giant amounts of data and giant amount of compute and energy
    but in Google Cloud you can use TPUs which they make a ton of and everyone else
    is desperately begging Nvidia for allocations to GPUs so if you're willing to
    not use CUDA and build on Google Stack they have an abundant amount of TPUs for
    you.

summary: 'This 246-minute podcast episode, "Google: The AI Company," provides a deep,
  historical, and strategic analysis of how Google became the epicenter of the modern
  AI revolution, focusing heavily on the development and impact of the Transformer
  architecture and the ensuing competitive landscape.


  Here is a comprehensive summary structured for professional insight:


  ---


  ## Comprehensive Podcast Summary: Google: The AI Company


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **history, strategic positioning, and inherent dilemma
  facing Google** as the "AI Company." This includes tracing the lineage of key AI
  talent from Google, the foundational role of the **Transformer architecture** (published
  by Google Brain in 2017), and the internal tension between protecting the highly
  profitable **Search monopoly** and aggressively pursuing the less immediately profitable,
  but potentially revolutionary, **Generative AI** wave. Key technical discussions
  revolve around early probabilistic language models (like **PHILL**), the concept
  of data compression equaling understanding, and the engineering feats required to
  scale these models (e.g., parallelization).


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Compression as Understanding:** The early hypothesis, posited by Google engineer
  George Herrick, that **data compression is technically equivalent to understanding**
  foreshadowed the core mechanism of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), which compress
  vast knowledge into dense vector representations.

  *   **The Transformer''s Genesis:** The entire current AI boom (OpenAI, Anthropic,
  etc.) is predicated on the **Transformer paper published by Google Brain in 2017**,
  highlighting Google''s foundational role in creating the architecture that powers
  modern generative AI.

  *   **Engineering for Scale (The Jeff Dean Effect):** Google’s early language models,
  like **PHILL**, were computationally prohibitive (12 hours per sentence). Jeff Dean’s
  intervention, by rearchitecting the system for **massive parallelization** across
  Google’s distributed infrastructure, reduced translation time to 100 milliseconds,
  proving the viability of large-scale production AI.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **The Innovator''s Dilemma:** Google faces a classic dilemma: launching superior
  AI products (based on the Transformer) threatens the massive, high-margin profits
  of its existing Search business, creating a strategic hesitation to fully commit
  resources.

  *   **Unique Asset Concentration:** Google is uniquely positioned as the only company
  possessing both a **frontier foundational model (Gemini)** and **proprietary, scaled
  AI chips (TPUs)**, positioning them as a top-tier player alongside Nvidia (GPUs).

  *   **Search as the Moat:** Despite the AI disruption, Google still controls the
  **"text box"—the primary entry point to the internet for intent-based queries**—which
  remains the critical asset to leverage for AI monetization.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Google Brain/DeepMind Talent:** The episode emphasizes that nearly every major
  figure in modern AI—including **Ilya Sutskever, Jeff Hinton, Alex Krizhevsky, Dario
  Amodei (Anthropic), and Demis Hassabis (DeepMind)**—was once a Google employee,
  underscoring Google''s historical dominance in AI talent acquisition.

  *   **Jeff Dean:** Portrayed as the engineering linchpin, responsible for critical
  infrastructure optimizations (like parallelizing PHILL) and a legendary figure whose
  efficiency is immortalized in "Jeff Dean Facts."

  *   **Larry Page:** His early vision defined Google as an AI company from its inception
  in 2000.

  *   **Noam Shazeer & George Herrick:** Key early researchers who pioneered probabilistic
  language models at Google, leading to the development of **PHILL**.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry is at an inflection point where **having
  both a frontier model and custom silicon (AI chips)** will separate commodity players
  from market leaders. The central question remains whether Google will overcome the
  profit protection instinct to fully capitalize on its foundational AI breakthroughs,
  or if competitors who have less legacy revenue to protect will seize the lead. The
  future hinges on Google''s ability to integrate Gemini effectively into its core
  services without cannibalizing search revenue.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **AI/ML professionals, technology strategists,
  venture capitalists, and corporate executives** interested in the competitive dynamics
  of the generative AI landscape, particularly those tracking Big Tech strategy and
  the history of foundational research.'
