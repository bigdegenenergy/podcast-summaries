  text: The payments world is one of network effects. I expect progress to be steady
    and then dramatic. A good example is stablecoin settlement across the card networks.
    Right now, stablecoin settlement is less efficient than fiat settlement because
    banks are paying in fiat, and then Visa has to create the stablecoin and pay it
    out.

summary: '# Podcast Summary: Will Every Company Have Its Own Stablecoin? Yes, Says
  Stripe''s Bridge


  **Duration Note**: Despite the listed 0-minute duration, this appears to be a full-length
  interview with substantial content.


  ## Focus Area

  This episode centers on **stablecoin infrastructure and the future of corporate
  digital currencies**, specifically discussing Bridge''s new "Open Issuance" platform
  that enables any business to create their own stablecoin. The conversation explores
  blockchain payments infrastructure, DeFi economics, and the evolution from centralized
  to distributed stablecoin issuance.


  ## Key Technical Insights

  • **Interoperability Solution**: Bridge is building a network that enables seamless
  1:1 conversion between different company stablecoins without user awareness, abstracting
  away gas fees and bridge costs

  • **Reserve Management Infrastructure**: The platform uses BlackRock for treasury
  management and audited smart contracts to ensure tokenized dollars never exceed
  actual dollar reserves

  • **Multi-Chain Architecture**: Integration with Stripe''s broader crypto stack
  including Privy (wallet layer), Bridge (banking layer), and the upcoming Tempo blockchain
  designed specifically for payment-scale applications


  ## Market/Investment Angle

  • **Economic Disruption of Duopoly**: Current stablecoin market dominated by two
  issuers (85% market share) creates economic misalignment - companies using stablecoins
  can''t capture treasury yields or control burn fees, making some use cases economically
  unviable

  • **Massive Market Opportunity**: Prediction that stablecoins will reach "many trillions
  of dollars" with systemic risk concerns driving demand for diversification beyond
  current two-issuer model

  • **Revenue Model Shift**: Companies can capture treasury yields from their own
  stablecoins rather than outsourcing to Circle/Tether, creating better unit economics
  for neo-banks and fintech platforms


  ## Notable Companies/People

  • **Zach Abrams**: Co-founder/CEO of Bridge, formerly at Coinbase

  • **Bridge/Stripe**: Recently acquired in largest crypto acquisition (since surpassed),
  now launching Open Issuance platform

  • **Current Customers**: Remitly, Ramp, MetaMask, Phantom, Native Markets (USDH)

  • **Infrastructure Partners**: BlackRock (treasury management), Shopify (crypto
  payments integration)

  • **Tempo**: Independent blockchain being incubated by Stripe, designed for payment-scale
  applications


  ## Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The conversation highlights how recent regulatory clarity, particularly around stablecoin
  legislation, has dramatically accelerated enterprise adoption. The passage of stablecoin
  regulatory frameworks has shifted Bridge''s customer base from small international
  developers to large US fintechs, banks, and treasury teams of major e-commerce companies.


  ## Future Implications

  The discussion suggests a fundamental shift toward **stablecoin infrastructure becoming
  invisible to end users** while enabling businesses to control their monetary rails.
  Key predictions include stablecoin settlement across card networks, instant settlement
  capabilities, and the emergence of programmable money that can be customized for
  specific platform needs. The conversation points toward a world where every major
  financial platform operates its own stablecoin while maintaining seamless interoperability.


  ## Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **crypto/fintech professionals, institutional
  investors, and enterprise decision-makers** considering stablecoin integration.
  The technical depth and business strategy focus make it particularly relevant for
  those building financial infrastructure or evaluating the competitive landscape
  of digital payments.

  ## Comprehensive Analysis


  This podcast episode presents a compelling vision for the future of corporate stablecoins,
  challenging the current duopoly model dominated by Circle and Tether. Zach Abrams
  articulates a clear thesis: the existing stablecoin infrastructure creates economic
  misalignments that prevent optimal use cases from emerging.


  **The Core Problem**: Current stablecoin issuers operate on an Assets Under Management
  (AUM) model, earning revenue from treasury yields. This creates friction for use
  cases like cross-border payments (which require burning stablecoins) and prevents
  companies from offering competitive yield-bearing products to their customers. Bridge''s
  solution addresses this by enabling companies to issue their own stablecoins while
  maintaining full economic control.


  **Technical Innovation**: The most intriguing aspect is Bridge''s planned interoperability
  network, which promises seamless conversion between different company stablecoins
  without user awareness. This could solve the fragmentation problem that typically
  emerges in multi-token ecosystems. The technical challenge of maintaining 1:1 conversions
  while abstracting gas fees represents a significant infrastructure investment.


  **Market Dynamics**: The conversation reveals how regulatory clarity has accelerated
  enterprise adoption, with Bridge''s customer base shifting from small international
  developers to major US financial institutions. This suggests the stablecoin market
  is entering a new maturity phase where regulatory compliance enables mainstream
  adoption.


  **Strategic Positioning**: Stripe''s broader crypto strategy becomes clearer through
  this lens - Privy provides wallet infrastructure, Bridge handles the banking layer,
  Stripe offers application-level integration, and Tempo will provide payment-optimized
  blockchain infrastructure. This vertical integration could provide significant competitive
  advantages.


  **Industry Implications**: If successful, this model could fundamentally reshape
  how businesses think about treasury management and customer relationships. The ability
  to offer yield-bearing, programmable money while maintaining full control over monetary
  policy represents a significant evolution from traditional banking relationships.


  The conversation suggests we''re moving toward a world where stablecoins become
  invisible infrastructure - users interact with "digital dollars" without knowing
  or caring about the'
