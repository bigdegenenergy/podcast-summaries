  text: We live in, we're working in a space where we can get so much data because
    we're working with on-chain analytics. There are ways to connect your wallet and

    to break up Big Tech monopolies (e.g., AWS).'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Things like decentralized cloud storage. So right now, we're living in a world...
    where the big tech guys rule everything. Amazon, you know, we have basically the
    five big stocks on the stock exchange. And so any sort of blockchain tool that
    could come in to change that and decentralize that monopoly is of interest to
    us as well.
  topic: web3_vision

    of the crypto market relative to established tech giants (like Apple), serving
    as a powerful argument for industry collaboration over maximalism.

    nature of centralized yield platforms, directly linking high returns to catastrophic

    crypto as the key bottleneck for achieving mass adoption among mainstream investors.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Thought leaders are super important because they give credibility to the space.
    So, someone that's coming probably from, like, a TradFi background that's gone
    into crypto in the last five, 10 years and can explain and give credibility to
    this not being a grifter's space... is going to be so important for mass adoption.

    communities, and genuine due diligence, contrasting them with paid macro-influencers.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: What's great about micro-influencers is that they've done a really good job
    of curating their communities, and people really trust them because they're doing
    what they love, and they're doing due diligence on projects, and they're doing—they're
    kind of keeping the crypto projects afloat.
  topic: Adoption/Strategy

    projects regarding marketing spend: prioritize micro-KOLs over expensive tier-one
    influencers.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: my suggestion from an agency and from a project perspective is to definitely
    invest more in micro-KOLs than in these big ones that are 100,000 followers or
    more, and they're charging a grand or 5 to 20 grand for a post because I think
    it's going to be the micro-influencers that are going to push projects forward
    for sure.

    in crypto: the necessity of critical questioning against established norms.'

  text: I think it's the ability to question a lot. So it's kind of like, does this
    work, does this not work? Why? The logic behind things. That's a word. So just
    questioning, understanding if this makes sense, why it makes sense. It should
    be going with the grain, should be questioning the normal route and try and figure
    out a way around it.

    challenging traditional institutions (TradFi).'

    degree because by the time you've studied it in four years, it's obsolete, right?

  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: Argues that collaboration is essential for survival and progress,
    especially during market downturns, contrasting with competitive maximalism.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: More than anything, crypto needs to be a collaborative space because especially
    when we see kind of a bear market, a lot of these products are very similar in
    nature. So the more collaborative we are, I think the more we can get ahead.
  topic: strategy

    focus back to real-world utility (supply chain) as the unifying goal.

    this, the that. At the end of the day, like what was I am going to be on a panel
    tomorrow about global like shipping supply chain and the importance behind blockchain
    and supply chain—something brutally probably not very interesting to many people—but
    the whole point is tha[t we need to focus on utility].
  topic: strategy

    that ecosystem growth requires interoperability and partnership across different
    chains/protocols, which is crucial for scaling adoption.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The only way for scale is collaboration. Like you cannot just go all in on
    one because there are only so many users, right?
  topic: Strategy/Technology
- impact_reason: Points to the next wave of innovation potentially residing in cross-cutting
    infrastructure layers, signaling where serious technical development might be
    focused beyond the L1/L2 race.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think the energy what I feel is really around different forms, like in different
    cool infrastructure products. So, how are we creating new layers? Things that
    aren't Layer 1 or not a Layer 2, but something that's going across every layer
    of blockchain—they don't even have a name for that type of thing.
  topic: Technology/Innovation
- impact_reason: Defines a 'true' thought leader as someone risking their existing,
    established reputation (often from TradFi) for their crypto advocacy, contrasting
    them sharply with paid anonymous shills (KOLs).
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: They're the ones that take their personal credibility. They're not making
    any money per se from that interaction. So, I think there are kind of three levels,
    and then there are the ones that just shill...
  topic: Adoption/Strategy

    of trustworthy, independent reporting due to the prevalence of pay-for-play schemes,
    which hinders public understanding and trust.'

    pressures are compromising editorial standards.
  relevance_score: 9

    tools to quantify community value to increase their earning potential.'

    community value, because that would allow them to scale and probably make more

    people in the world even understand what we do, what's happening in crypto.

    learning and passion to acquire necessary Web3 skills.'

    in the space, you don't learn about it. So I think at the actual fundamental level
    of education is where we need to be working on reach.

    short-form certification courses over traditional degrees.'

  text: One, like through certification programs. So we come up and doing that in
    partnership with bigger crypto brands. So if we're, you know, we're trying to
    think of financial literacy, maybe we can partner with, like, a wallet, and they
    sponsor a 12-week course...
  topic: adoption
- impact_reason: Redefines PR in Web3 as 'thought leadership' focused on sharing genuine
    insights rather than simple promotion ('shilling').
  relevance_score: 8
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: PR is huge to be to PR. We do organic PR, and it's mostly—I would actually
    refer to it more as thought leadership because I think that there are a lot of
    people in this space who have a lot of good things to say and interesting things

summary: '## Comprehensive Summary: Why the Crypto Industry Needs Authentic Thought
  Leadership Now More Than Ever Before, with Catie Romero-Finger @ BABs


  This podcast episode, featuring Catie Romero-Finger, founder of the data-driven
  Web3 marketing agency Babs Labs, centers on the critical need for **authentic thought
  leadership** to drive genuine adoption and credibility in the cryptocurrency and
  blockchain space. The discussion weaves through Romero-Finger’s unconventional background,
  the strategic importance of data in marketing, and the necessity of collaboration
  over maximalism.


  **Main Narrative Arc and Key Discussion Points:**


  The conversation begins with Romero-Finger detailing her background—a philosophy
  major followed by an MBA and strategic consulting—noting that philosophy majors
  often thrive in crypto due to their inherent inclination to question established
  institutions and logic. She then introduces Babs Labs, positioning it as a **data-driven
  growth marketing agency** focused on leveraging on-chain analytics to create effective
  campaigns. A significant portion of the dialogue shifts to the challenges of achieving
  **reach** in a world where crypto understanding is low. This leads directly into
  the core theme: the necessity of **thought leadership** to build trust, especially
  among mainstream investors who are wary of the industry''s reputation for scams
  and volatility. The discussion contrasts genuine thought leaders with anonymous,
  paid "KOLs" (Key Opinion Leaders) who merely shill projects. Finally, they touch
  upon the evolving event landscape, noting the shift towards curated, work-focused
  side events, and the current "vibe" in the market, which favors infrastructure and
  innovative DeFi over stablecoins.


  **Key Technical Insights:**


  *   **Data-Driven Web3 Marketing:** Babs Labs'' core philosophy is that all growth
  initiatives must be fueled by data, specifically utilizing **on-chain analytics**
  to understand user behavior and create better-targeted campaigns.

  *   **Emerging Tech Focus:** The agency prioritizes projects focused on tangible
  innovation, such as decentralized cloud storage (challenging Big Tech monopolies)
  and improving payment rails, especially for emerging markets.

  *   **Education Obsolescence:** The rapid pace of blockchain development means traditional
  four-year university degrees are often obsolete upon graduation, necessitating agile,
  certification-based, or modular educational approaches (e.g., partnering with wallets
  for financial literacy courses).


  **Market/Investment Angle:**


  *   **Collaboration Over Silos:** The crypto market cap is currently smaller than
  that of a single Web2 giant (like Apple), making **collaboration** between projects
  essential for scaling and moving the entire ecosystem forward, directly countering
  maximalist mentalities.

  *   **Credibility for Mass Adoption:** For wealth generation and retirement investing,
  mainstream adoption hinges on credible figures (doxxed experts appearing on Bloomberg)
  vouching for the trustworthiness and long-term utility of blockchain, moving beyond
  simple investment advice.

  *   **Risk Awareness:** The conversation highlights the pitfalls of high-yield promises,
  referencing personal negative experiences with Celsius and insecure wallets, underscoring
  the need for security alongside innovation.


  **Notable Companies/People:**


  *   **Babs Labs:** Catie Romero-Finger''s data-driven marketing and growth agency
  for Web3.

  *   **Corda:** Mentioned as the permissioned blockchain Romero-Finger first worked
  with.

  *   **Open Campus (Anna Mocha Brands):** Mentioned in the context of educational
  initiatives.

  *   **Or (Decentralized AI Product):** Referenced via a professor client at Columbia
  University who teaches a highly sought-after blockchain course.

  *   **Vitalik Buterin:** Cited as an example of a leader whose vision emphasizes
  collaboration, which has proven highly effective for ecosystem growth.


  **Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**


  While not a deep dive, the discussion implies a need for more sophisticated engagement
  with regulators. Thought leaders are needed to frame crypto not just as a call for
  "less regulation," but as a necessary tool for **diversifying economic systems**
  and securing futures, which is a more palatable narrative for mainstream policymakers.


  **Future Implications:**


  The industry is moving toward a phase where **substance and verifiable utility**
  will outweigh hype. The focus must shift from internal tribalism (maximalism) to
  external education and collaboration to onboard the next wave of users who require
  trust and clear value propositions. The future success of Web3 depends on its ability
  to produce credible, transparent voices who can bridge the gap between the technology
  and traditional finance/society.


  **Target Audience:**


  This episode is highly valuable for **Web3 marketing professionals, founders, investors,
  and strategic consultants** who are focused on driving genuine, sustainable growth
  and building industry credibility beyond speculative trading.'
