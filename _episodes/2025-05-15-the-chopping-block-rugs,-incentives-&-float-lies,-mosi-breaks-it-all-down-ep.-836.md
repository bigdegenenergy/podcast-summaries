    while obscuring the trail of tokens, highlighting regulatory evasion.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: As a founder, you can also cash out with the market maker. I think that's
    also a pretty common practice nowadays... if you use the tokens to your market
    maker, and then they transfer to another entity in your name, it's much better
    for you as a founder because the chances of getting caught are way lower.

    infrastructure bets with revaluation potential over funding useful applications,
    which harms overall crypto adoption.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: As a VC, you have an incentive to deploy or like in for because it has a revaluation
    potential, a bigger time, and potentially a total is going to be worth more. And
    personally, I think that's bad. I think that's something that we need to eliminate.
  topic: Business/Adoption
- impact_reason: Details the unfavorable sequencing of token distribution/liquidity
    events, showing how VCs are often last in line to realize gains compared to founders,
    exchanges, and airdropped retail.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: As a VC, you're actually the last to get fed in that process because all the
    unlocks, all the fucking, you know, like the exchanges getting paid, retail is
    getting the airdrop, all these other people are getting out before you unlock
    even your first tranche of tokens, right?

    direct, democratic access to founders, which is both positive and a source of
    intense community pressure.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: if you look at crypto dynamics from fundamental, it's like it's very different
    to build in crypto than to build in any other industry, because in crypto, like
    it's very weird because as a random community member of a project, you can approach
    the founder and be like, 'Bro, I think you're fucking off,' and many times the
    founder is going to reply to you. It's a little bit more democratic in a way.
  topic: Web3/Technology
- impact_reason: 'A significant critique of current crypto incentive structures: founders
    can cash out substantially even if the project lacks Product-Market Fit (PMF),
    suggesting a misalignment of incentives compared to traditional tech.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But in crypto, I might get a liquidity event, fail, but still the founders
    might make a lot of money. I think that's something that is wrong about the industry
    too, because it's like pity you might launch a project that had no PMF, but you
    can still make a big chunk out of it as a founder.

- impact_reason: A strong ethical critique of the crypto incentive structure where
    founders can profit significantly even without achieving Product-Market Fit (PMF).

    profit should only be derived from achieving Product-Market Fit, not just token
    allocation.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: If you don't win the game, it's not okay for you to make money. And winning
    the game doesn't just mean you have this FDV or you have this float or whatever,
    it means PMF. If you don't have PMF, you don't get to make money.

    launches—being the last in line and most vulnerable to losses.

  text: retail investors have a shoot to these projects, and sometimes many of them
    do get robbed because, unfortunately, they are the last ones to eat in the pyramid.

    and liquidity of crypto tokens upon launch, contrasting sharply with traditional
    IPO timelines.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: They basically go public within 12 hours of launching effectively.
  topic: technology/adoption
- impact_reason: This is a sharp, cynical observation about speculative assets, suggesting
    that high valuation pumps are often driven by assets with the least tangible underlying
    value ('hallucination yield').

  text: The acids that pump the most are the acids that are harder to value, stuff
    that has a very high hallucination yield.
  topic: Investment Thesis

    over identity in the crypto space, especially for an anon.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I just created this account, this Mosey account, just to better understand
    markets and be able to connect better with crypto people. And also, I think just
    showing people that the only thing that matters in crypto are your ideas, and
    that's it.
  topic: Web3 Vision
- impact_reason: Explains how centralized control over supply allows market makers
    to manipulate leveraged traders for profit.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: They can sort of liquidate all the shorts and liquidate all the longs as they
    see fit because they in general, they own most of the supply, right? So they can
    use all the guys using leverage just like exit liquidity.
  topic: Market Structure/DeFi
- impact_reason: Directly labels the 'sell OTC and buy liquid' tactic as fundamentally
    unsustainable and Ponzi-like.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And the thing is, it's essentially a Ponzi scheme because when the token unlocks,
    of course, investors are going to be rushing to sell, right? So, it's already
    unsustainable.
  topic: DeFi/Manipulation
- impact_reason: Exposes the mechanism (using unregulated/unwilling market makers)
    through which bad actors can offload tokens for fiat, highlighting regulatory
    arbitrage.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: the best way to cash out is again to a market maker that is willing to do
    this. I do agree with you that not all market makers are willing to do this, especially
    the ones that are regulated are going to tell you by not doing this.
  topic: Regulation/Fraud

    when cashing out illicit gains, pointing to jurisdictions with lax enforcement.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: they're also in places where regulation is a little bit more like, of course,
    if you want to cash out to an entity in the US, it's very likely you're going
    to get in serious trouble, but you cash out like to buy or I don't like same kids
    and never, it's think it's a little bit more lenient.
  topic: Regulation/Fraud
- impact_reason: Explains the critical structural difference between liquid exchange
    prices and private OTC pricing, especially for low-float assets, which is key
    to understanding insider moves.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: 'I think making it clear that even when it would like low-float tokens, like
    that always like two markets: the liquid market and the OTC market, and usually
    the prices is quite a lot. It can be like 80%, but you can buy OTC at like 80%
    discounted if you have enough size.'
  topic: Investment/Market Structure
- impact_reason: 'Defines the ideal governance standard: OTC sales by early investors/insiders
    should require team approval, contrasting it with current lax practices.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think say if I'm talking more on stew as well, which is that you cannot
    just cash out OTC, right? Not without team's approval, right? That's not how it
    should work.
  topic: Business/Strategy
- impact_reason: Details standard VC protective clauses (anti-hedging/selling terms)
    designed to ensure alignment, which are often violated in practice.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Most of these terms when VCs are investing involve, you know, a term against
    hedging, term against selling. So, you must maintain your price exposure to this

summary: '## Podcast Summary: The Chopping Block: Rugs, Incentives & Float Lies (Ep.
  836)


  This episode of The Chopping Block features special guest **Mosey (@VannaCharmer)**,
  an anonymous crypto analyst known for exposing market microstructure issues and
  alleged malfeasance in token projects. The core discussion revolves around **market
  manipulation, opaque float dynamics, and the systemic incentives driving bad behavior**
  in the crypto ecosystem, particularly concerning token launches and early-stage
  investment structures.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Crypto Market Structure and Integrity**, specifically dissecting
  how token supply dynamics, market making, and early-stage investment practices (like
  OTC sales) are exploited to create artificially inflated valuations and facilitate
  potential "rug pulls" or deceptive exits.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Float Misrepresentation:** Projects deliberately obscure the true circulating
  supply, allowing them to advertise massive, misleading market caps based on a tiny
  fraction of tokens actually available for trading.

  *   **Market Maker Collusion:** Market makers (MMs) can be incentivized to trade
  against retail, using their privileged position (often holding significant supply)
  to liquidate leverage positions and facilitate founder cash-outs.

  *   **OTC Manipulation Playbook:** A key tactic involves foundations selling locked
  tokens OTC at a discount to large buyers, using the resulting capital to buy the
  token on the open market, artificially pumping the price before the locked tokens
  unlock and crash the market (a "Ponzi scheme" dynamic).


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Incentives for Deception:** The current structure rewards tokens with high
  "hallucination yield" (high perceived value with low underlying substance), as long
  as funds can offload exposure before the inevitable collapse.

  *   **Founder Alignment Risk:** Founders are actively discouraged from raising from
  VCs who engage in hedging or manipulative practices, as this signals misalignment
  with the project''s long-term vision.

  *   **Liquidity Illusion:** The perceived market cap of low-float tokens is an "illusion"
  that retail investors mistake for real value, leading to massive losses when the
  price corrects to reflect actual liquidity.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Mosey (@VannaCharmer):** The guest, an anonymous analyst who gained notoriety
  for calling out issues related to **Home** and **Movement** token blow-ups.

  *   **Mantra:** Mentioned specifically as a project whose founder allegedly admitted
  to the "sell OTC and buy liquid" playbook on a podcast, alongside suspicious wallet
  activity related to bridging/mirror bucket wallets.

  *   **Hyperliquid:** Cited as an example of a decentralized options platform where
  on-chain activity makes tracking hedging/shorting potentially easier than on traditional
  centralized exchanges.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  *   The discussion highlights that the described activities (manipulating float,
  coordinated OTC sales to inflate price) constitute **market manipulation and fraud**.

  *   The difficulty in policing these actions stems from entities being located in
  lenient jurisdictions and structuring ownership through non-founder names (lawyers,
  other entities).

  *   There is a recognized need for **greater consequences** for VCs and founders
  who violate investment terms (e.g., hedging restrictions in SAFTs), though enforcement
  remains extremely difficult.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests the industry needs a significant shift toward **transparency
  and accountability** to restore trust. Mosey proposes that **open-source disclosures**
  from exchanges (e.g., disclosing MM holdings and activity) and clearer labeling
  of OTC vs. liquid markets are necessary steps to combat these structural issues.
  Without these changes, sophisticated market manipulation will continue to plague
  new token launches.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Investors (especially early-stage/VCs),
  DeFi Professionals, Crypto Builders/Founders, and Market Structure Analysts** who
  need an insider''s view on systemic risks and manipulative tactics in the current
  token economy.'
