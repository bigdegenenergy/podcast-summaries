    trends (like DAO buying pressure) even if the underlying mechanism seems questionable,
    citing significant impact on ETH supply.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: First takeaway is probably just don't fight the flows. I remember when I saw
    these DAOs first appear on the Ethereum side, my first reaction was one of rejection...
    But at the end of the day, Ethereum DAOs have bought $500 million of ETH, and
    they now account for like 2.5% of Ethereum's total supply.
  topic: Investment/DeFi
- impact_reason: Indicates a strategic shift by the Solana Foundation to embrace the
    DAO trend as a necessary mechanism for price support and market relevance.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The Solana Foundation is clearly more involved with these DAOs today than
    they were maybe a couple of months ago... It's coming around to DAOs since saying
    that whether or not this is a long-term game remains to be seen, but we need to
    in some way be involved in this because it is a major driver of price.

    and scale of institutional/DAO capital deployment into ETH versus BTC, highlighting

  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: VanEck, surprisingly in my view, on Friday filed for an S-1 for a Gido SOL
    ETF. So this would be like a Solana ETF, but instead of holding, I guess, N-ETH,
    holding naked SOL and then having like a staking provider, probably Coinbase,
    that would stake it for you and then provide the rewards.
  topic: regulation/defi

    is superior for investor yield and tax efficiency compared to a standard asset-plus-staking-provider
    model.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: This has tax issues and some other things that are suboptimal about it [naked
    SOL ETF staking]... You would just buy the Gido SOL liquid staking token where

    viability of LSD-based ETFs.

    for the regulatory compliance (Howey Test) of their LSD, suggesting a blueprint
    for other protocols.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: Gido SOL is due to tip router, which sort of automatically routes out staking
    rewards. They have been making the case basically that Gido SOL is due to tip

    the Howey Test than other liquid staking tokens.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Are DATs Bullish For Solana? | Carlos Gonzalez
  Campo


  This 56-minute episode of *Light Speed* with host Jack Cuberanek and guest Carlos
  Gonzalez Campo of Blockworks Research focuses heavily on the emerging trend of Decentralized
  Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) targeting Solana, and the potential impact of these
  large treasury vehicles on the SOL asset. The discussion also touches upon the regulatory
  landscape concerning liquid staking tokens and the broader narrative required for
  Solana''s institutional adoption.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Crypto/Web3**, specifically analyzing the **Solana ecosystem''s
  development**, the **DAO treasury trend** (mirroring Ethereum''s recent activity),
  and the **institutionalization** of Solana assets through proposed ETFs and large
  capital pools.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **LSD Efficiency for ETFs:** The proposed VanEck Gido SOL ETF, utilizing the
  liquid staking derivative (LSD) Gido SOL instead of naked SOL plus a third-party
  staking provider, is technically superior. It allows for greater operational efficiency,
  potentially higher staking yields for investors, and fewer taxable events compared
  to traditional staking ETF structures.

  *   **DAO Active Involvement:** Unlike passive ETFs, DAOs can be actively involved
  in the network''s growth—for example, by voting on governance proposals (like Curve
  supporting Alpenglow) and launching integrated DeFi products (like LSDs), pushing
  adoption forward.

  *   **Regulatory Clarity on LSDs:** The SEC''s recent stance suggesting that liquid
  staking tokens are *not* securities is a crucial development that clears the path
  for more complex, yield-bearing financial products like the Gido SOL ETF.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **DAO Buying Pressure:** The emergence of massive Solana DAOs (including a potential
  $1 billion vehicle from Galaxy/Multicoin) is expected to create a significant, sustainable
  stream of buying pressure for SOL, similar to what was observed in Ethereum.

  *   **Frothiness Indicator:** The speed at which Ethereum DAOs accumulated 1% of
  the ETH supply (40 days, compared to Michael Saylor''s 3.5 years for BTC) signals
  that the market is currently "quite hot" and potentially frothy.

  *   **Solana ETF Landscape:** The filing for a Gido SOL ETF suggests institutional
  interest is broadening beyond just the base asset, but there is an open question
  regarding investor preference between a Gido SOL-specific ETF versus a standard
  SOL ETF.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Galaxy Jump & Multicoin:** Leading the proposed $1 billion Solana DAO treasury
  vehicle, indicating significant institutional backing for Solana ecosystem growth.

  *   **Sharp’s Technology:** Co-founders of the Jambo phone are launching a $400
  million private placement DAO, with the Solana Foundation agreeing to sell $15 million
  in SOL at a 15% discount to support the effort.

  *   **Solana Foundation:** Increasingly involved in supporting these DAO efforts,
  suggesting a strategic pivot to embrace the DAO trend as a major price driver.

  *   **Tom Lee/Michael Saylor:** Used as benchmarks for successful "cheerleaders"
  who bridge the gap between crypto technology and TradFi narratives.

  *   **Kyle Samani (Multicoin) & Mike Novogratz:** Mentioned as potential, though
  perhaps obvious, candidates to become Solana''s primary TradFi evangelist/figurehead.

  *   **Gido:** Highlighted for their persistent efforts in lobbying the SEC to enable
  the Gido SOL LSD ETF structure.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion noted the legal ambiguity surrounding insider trading in crypto,
  referencing the recent DOJ case against Coinbase employees. More importantly, the
  SEC''s apparent decision that **liquid staking tokens are not securities** is viewed
  as a significant regulatory win that directly enables the Gido SOL ETF filing.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests that Solana is next in line for the "DAO craze" that has
  benefited Ethereum. The ecosystem needs a strong, credible **TradFi figurehead**
  (a "Solana Tom Lee") to effectively communicate its value proposition—fast, cheap,
  developer-friendly—to institutional audiences and combat the misconception that
  Solana is purely a "meme coin chain." The involvement of major funds in DAOs signals
  a serious, coordinated effort to institutionalize Solana.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto/Web3 Professionals, Institutional Investors,
  DeFi Strategists, and Solana Ecosystem Participants** who need to understand capital
  flow dynamics, emerging treasury structures, and the path to broader institutional
  adoption for Layer 1 blockchains.'
