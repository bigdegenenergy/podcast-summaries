summary: '**Podcast Episode Summary: Why Hyperliquid Should Cut Its Total Token Supply
  Nearly in Half**


  **Crypto Focus Area:**

  The episode primarily focuses on tokenomics within the crypto space, particularly
  the discrepancies between Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) and circulating market cap
  in the context of Hyperliquid. It also touches on governance and accounting practices
  in DeFi and Web3 projects.


  **Key Technical Insights:**

  - **Token Supply Dynamics:** The discussion highlights the importance of understanding
  the differences between FDV and circulating market cap, emphasizing that FDV often
  overstates a protocol''s valuation by including tokens that are authorized but not
  yet in circulation.

  - **Accounting Adjustments:** The proposal suggests accounting changes to better
  align reported metrics with actual market conditions, such as burning tokens in
  the assistance fund and removing the max supply cap to reflect a more realistic
  valuation.


  **Market/Investment Angle:**

  - **Valuation Metrics:** Investors are advised to consider adjusted market caps
  that account for known token allocations and future emissions, rather than relying
  solely on FDV, which can mislead due to its inclusion of non-circulating tokens.

  - **Supply Overhang Concerns:** The episode discusses potential market impacts of
  large token unlocks, suggesting that the market might not absorb these efficiently,
  leading to price pressures.


  **Notable Crypto Projects/People:**

  - **Hyperliquid:** The main subject of the episode, with discussions on its tokenomics
  and governance proposals.

  - **John Chabinau:** Co-founder and general partner of DBA, who provides insights
  into the proposal and broader industry practices.

  - **Haseeb Qureshi:** Mentioned for his commentary on token distribution practices
  and governance.


  **Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  The episode touches on the regulatory implications of token distribution, noting
  that past practices of allocating large community buckets were partly driven by
  regulatory considerations to avoid insider ownership perceptions.


  **Future Implications:**

  The conversation suggests a shift towards more transparent and realistic tokenomics
  in the crypto industry, with a focus on aligning accounting practices with traditional
  finance standards. This could lead to more informed investment decisions and better
  governance practices.


  **Target Audience:**

  This episode is particularly valuable for crypto investors, traders, and project
  developers interested in understanding tokenomics, valuation metrics, and governance
  in the crypto space.


  **Main Narrative Arc and Key Discussion Points:**

  The episode revolves around a proposal to reduce Hyperliquid''s token supply by
  nearly half, aiming to address discrepancies between FDV and actual market valuations.
  It explores the implications of token supply dynamics on market perceptions and
  investment decisions, advocating for accounting changes to provide clearer valuation
  metrics.


  **Technical Concepts, Methodologies, or Frameworks Discussed:**

  The discussion includes technical aspects of token supply categorization, such as
  the assistance fund and future emissions/community rewards, and how these should
  be accounted for in valuation metrics.


  **Business Implications and Strategic Insights:**

  The proposal is positioned as a strategic move to improve Hyperliquid''s market
  perception and attract more informed investors by aligning its reported metrics
  with actual market realities.


  **Key Personalities, Experts, or Thought Leaders Mentioned:**

  John Chabinau and Haseeb Qureshi are highlighted for their insights into tokenomics
  and governance practices.


  **Predictions, Trends, or Future-Looking Statements:**

  The episode predicts a trend towards more realistic and transparent tokenomics in
  the crypto industry, moving away from outdated practices like fixed max supply caps.


  **Practical Applications and Real-World Examples:**

  The proposal''s practical application involves accounting changes to Hyperliquid''s
  token supply, serving as a case study for other projects facing similar valuation
  challenges.


  **Controversies, Challenges, or Problems Highlighted:**

  Challenges include the market''s reliance on FDV for valuation, which can mislead
  investors, and the potential market impact of large token unlocks.


  **Solutions, Recommendations, or Actionable Advice Provided:**

  The episode recommends accounting adjustments to better reflect true market valuations
  and suggests governance improvements to ensure transparent decision-making.


  **Context About Why This Conversation Matters to the Industry:**

  This conversation is crucial as it addresses common valuation and governance issues
  in the crypto industry, offering solutions that could lead to more sustainable and
  transparent practices, ultimately benefiting investors and project developers alike.'
