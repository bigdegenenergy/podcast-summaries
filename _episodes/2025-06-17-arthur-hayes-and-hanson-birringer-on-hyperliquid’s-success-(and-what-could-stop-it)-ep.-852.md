  text: If you can just obfuscate all of that [starting an exchange] and really just
    basically plug into an existing tech stack, that saves you a ton of time, and
    you really only have to focus on user acquisition, which is a very hard problem
    to get, but arguably a simpler one than getting all the liquidity.

    40% left supply earmarked for the community.

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Arthur Hayes and Hanson Birringer on Hyperliquid’s Success
  (And What Could Stop It) - Ep. 852


  This episode of Unchained features Arthur Hayes (CIO of Milstrom) and Hanson Birringer
  (Head of US Sales at FlowDesk) discussing the meteoric rise of the decentralized
  perpetual swap exchange, **HyperLiquid**, following its fair-launch airdrop in November.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The discussion centers on **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**, specifically the success
  of **decentralized perpetual futures exchanges (DEXs)**, the mechanics of on-chain
  trading transparency, and the business model that has propelled HyperLiquid to rank
  among the top global futures exchanges.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **HyperCore as a Liquidity Layer:** HyperLiquid’s success is attributed not
  just to its front-end UI but to its underlying technology stack (HyperCore), which
  allows other applications (via builder codes and upcoming features like HIP-3) to
  plug in and utilize its liquidity for building novel products, including tokenized
  equities perps.

  *   **On-Chain Transparency Advantage:** The transparency of on-chain trading (visible
  P&L, liquidation levels) is seen as a net positive, allowing sophisticated actors
  (like market makers) to strategically place orders (e.g., "stink bids" near liquidation
  levels) and providing verifiable proof of performance, unlike many KOLs on centralized
  exchanges.

  *   **L1 vs. L2 Valuation Mindset:** The market is currently valuing HyperLiquid
  as an "L-something" (Layer 1/Protocol) rather than just a DEX, granting it a higher
  price-to-earnings multiple due to its proven client base and revenue generation
  capabilities.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **The Power of a Good Airdrop:** HyperLiquid’s success is heavily credited to
  its "fair launch" and airdrop execution, which successfully rewarded retail users
  based on trading flow, fostering deep community loyalty—a key factor in retaining
  capital within the growing HyperEVM ecosystem.

  *   **Revenue Concentration:** Similar to historical derivatives markets, a small
  cohort (estimated 10,000 to 50,000 traders) generates the vast majority of revenue
  for the entire crypto trading ecosystem, and HyperLiquid is currently capturing
  this high-value segment.

  *   **Valuation Headwind:** The primary short-term risk to HyperLiquid’s high valuation
  (currently around $45B FDV) is the impending launch of regulated perpetual products
  by major US centralized exchanges like **Coinbase and Robinhood**, which will target
  the American retail "degens" who currently rely on HyperLiquid due to jurisdictional
  limitations.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **HyperLiquid:** The subject of the discussion, praised for its engineering
  output (small team generating massive results) and business execution (fair launch,
  high revenue buybacks).

  *   **Arthur Hayes:** Provided historical context on perpetuals and emphasized the
  importance of making retail users rich to build loyalty.

  *   **James Wynn:** The pseudonymous trader whose highly publicized, massive long
  position and subsequent $13 million loss on HyperLiquid highlighted the platform''s
  transparency and the cultural phenomenon of leaderboard trading.

  *   **Coinbase/Robinhood:** Mentioned as the key centralized competitors whose upcoming
  US perp offerings pose a direct threat to HyperLiquid’s current user base.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  The discussion directly addresses the regulatory impact: the launch of US-regulated
  perp exchanges by Coinbase and Robinhood will siphon off a segment of HyperLiquid’s
  users—specifically Americans who currently use the DEX as an easier alternative
  to navigating complex on-chain mechanics or who are restricted from CEXs. The debate
  hinges on whether the overall market expansion ("the pie gets bigger") will offset
  HyperLiquid''s loss of market share.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation suggests a future where on-chain infrastructure like HyperCore
  becomes the foundational liquidity layer for various financial products, including
  tokenized traditional assets (like S&P 500 futures). Furthermore, the social dynamics
  observed in the James Wynn saga—where on-chain verifiability elevates KOL status—suggests
  leaderboard trading and performance promotion will become increasingly public and
  tied to DEX platforms.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is most valuable for **Crypto/DeFi professionals, quantitative traders,
  market makers, and crypto investors** interested in the mechanics, business strategy,
