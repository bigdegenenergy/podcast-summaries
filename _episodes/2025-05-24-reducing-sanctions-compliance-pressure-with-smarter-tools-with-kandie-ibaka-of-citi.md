summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Reducing Sanctions Compliance Pressure with
  Smarter Tools - with Kandie Ibaka of Citi


  This 17-minute episode dives into the escalating complexity of sanctions compliance
  in 2025 and how financial institutions are leveraging advanced technology, particularly
  AI/ML, to transition from reactive monitoring to proactive risk guidance.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is the **evolution of sanctions compliance workflows** within
  large financial institutions, specifically addressing the overwhelming volume of
  new regulations and the shifting expectations from regulators. Key themes include
  the application of **automation and AI/ML** to translate policy changes into real-time
  operational strategy, and the necessary evolution of compliance professional skill
  sets.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **ML for "So What" Analysis:** Machine learning is moving beyond simply flagging
  regulatory changes to helping compliance teams understand the *implications* ("the
  so what")â€”connecting new guidance to existing controls, risk appetite, and specific
  business lines or transaction types in real-time.

  *   **Automation for Ingestion and Mapping:** Automation tools are actively used
  to ingest new regulatory guidance and immediately map its impact against the institution''s
  current control framework, ensuring immediate operational relevance.

  *   **Data Quality as a Prerequisite:** A major technical challenge remains ensuring
  the **quality, consistency, and completeness of human-generated data** across disparate
  regional systems, which directly impacts the reliability of AI/ML outputs.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **Shift in Regulatory Expectation:** The relationship with regulators has fundamentally
  changed; institutions are now expected to provide **real-time insight** and demonstrate
  the rationale behind every decision (escalation or non-escalation), moving beyond
  simple post-facto documentation.

  *   **Proactive Risk Guidance:** Successful compliance is now defined by the ability
  to guide risk proactively, advising leadership on risk trade-offs and demonstrating
  that systems are designed to catch issues *before* they become problems.

  *   **Vendor Trust and Transparency:** Financial institutions require vendors utilizing
  AI to provide clear visibility into system logic and data provenance to maintain
  trust and meet governance demands, especially concerning potential hallucinations
  in generative AI applications.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Kandie Ibaka (Citi):** Vice President and Sanctions Control Officer, providing
  expert insight into the operational realities, technological adoption, and regulatory
  pressures facing sanctions compliance leaders.

  *   **Citi:** The institutional context for the discussion, highlighting how a major
  bank is implementing these technological and procedural shifts.

  *   **Mindbridge:** Sponsor of the special series on AI and financial workflows.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a model where compliance professionals must be **analytical
  storytellers** who can translate complex, data-driven risk narratives into defensible
  arguments for regulators and leadership. The required skill set for compliance staff
  is shifting from pure execution to **cross-functional fluency** (connecting with
  tech, legal, and ops) and **adaptability** to continuously evolving tools.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Financial Services Compliance Professionals,
  Risk Managers, Financial Crime Technology Leaders, and Executives** involved in
  AI adoption strategy within regulated industries. It is essential for those needing
  to understand the practical application of AI in high-stakes regulatory environments.'
