summary: '## Podcast Summary: 🛡️Zero-Trust AI: A Quantum-Resilient Framework for the
  Enterprise


  This 24-minute episode of *AI Unraveled* addresses the urgent, dual existential
  threats facing modern enterprise AI: intrinsic machine learning vulnerabilities
  and the impending quantum decryption threat. The discussion pivots from outlining
  these converging crises to presenting a comprehensive, three-pillar strategic defense:
  the **Quantum-Resilient Zero Trust AI Framework**.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Enterprise AI Security and Resilience**, specifically addressing
  the intersection of adversarial machine learning attacks (data poisoning, evasion,
  inference) and the cryptographic obsolescence caused by quantum computing (Q-Day).
  The core deliverable is the introduction and detailed breakdown of the proposed
  Zero Trust AI framework.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **Intrinsic AI Vulnerabilities:** Attacks are categorized across the ML lifecycle:
  **Data Poisoning** (corrupting training data via supply chain/insider threats),
  **Inference Attacks** (model inversion/membership inference to steal training data
  secrets), and **Evasion Attacks** (adversarial examples causing real-time misclassification).
  LLMs introduce specific risks like **Prompt Injection** and **Hallucination Abuse**
  (seeding the web with fake content).

  *   **Quantum Threat (HNDL):** The "Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" (HNDL) strategy
  is an immediate danger, where adversaries store currently encrypted sensitive data,
  anticipating future decryption by a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer
  (CRQC) expected around 2030–2035 via Shor''s algorithm.

  *   **Pillar 2: Verifiable Provenance:** Integrity is secured by recording cryptographic
  hashes of critical artifacts (data sets, model weights) onto an immutable ledger,
  such as a permissioned blockchain, creating an undeniable chain of custody against
  tampering.


  ### 3. Business/Investment Angle

  *   **AI as Critical Asset:** AI is no longer a side project but a core enterprise
  asset driving functions like drug discovery and financial modeling, making its security
  paramount.

  *   **Urgency of Migration:** The HNDL threat means any data requiring confidentiality
  beyond the next decade is already vulnerable, necessitating immediate planning for
  Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) migration.

  *   **MLOps Investment Shift:** Security spending must shift from traditional perimeter
  defense to rigorous, continuous verification across the entire MLOPS lifecycle,
  demanding new tooling and expertise in Zero Trust principles applied to AI pipelines.


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology):** Mentioned as the
  driving force behind standardizing the new PQC algorithms (e.g., ML-KEM, ML-DSA),
  which form the basis of the quantum-resistant foundation.

  *   **Ownwell & Granger:** Mentioned during unrelated sponsorship segments at the
  beginning of the podcast.

  *   **Microsoft Tay:** Cited as a historical example of public data poisoning/model
  corruption.


  ### 5. Future Implications

  The industry is moving toward a security model where **implicit trust is eliminated**
  across the entire data and model lifecycle. Future security architecture must be
  **crypto-agile**, capable of swapping out cryptographic primitives as new standards
  emerge or vulnerabilities are found in PQC algorithms. Furthermore, the convergence
  of AI and quantum threats suggests the rise of **Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning
  (QAML)**, requiring defenses that are algorithmically agile.


  ### 6. Target Audience

  **Senior Enterprise Leaders, CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and MLOps Heads.** This content
  is highly technical and strategic, aimed at professionals responsible for securing
  mission-critical, production-scale AI systems against long-term existential threats.

  ### Comprehensive Narrative Summary


  The podcast establishes that enterprise AI faces a "converging storm" of threats
  that render legacy security models obsolete. The first prong is the **intrinsic
  vulnerability of AI models** themselves, which are susceptible to attacks exploiting
  their statistical nature. The discussion meticulously details these attacks: **data
  poisoning** targeting training sets, **inference attacks** stealing proprietary
  knowledge from deployed models, and **evasion attacks** (adversarial examples) forcing
  real-time misclassifications. The rise of LLMs adds risks like prompt injection
  and the weaponization of model hallucinations.


  The second, equally critical prong is the **quantum decryption threat**. The imminent
  arrival of a Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computer (CRQC) threatens to break
  all current asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC) via Shor’s algorithm. This danger is
  immediate due to the **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later (HNDL)** strategy employed by
  sophisticated adversaries.


  To counter this perfect storm, the episode introduces the **Quantum-Resilient Zero
  Trust AI Framework**, built on three mandatory pillars:


  1.  **Zero Trust MLOPS:** This requires eliminating all implicit trust within the
  development and deployment pipeline. It mandates continuous verification, strict
  enforcement of least privilege (e.g., inference servers only getting execute access),
  microsegmentation to contain breaches, and heavy investment in real-time behavioral
  monitoring to detect anomalies indicative of theft or tampering.

  2.  **Verifiable Provenance:** To guarantee asset integrity, systems must establish
  an immutable chain of custody. This is achieved by using technologies like permissioned
  blockchain to record cryptographic hashes of data sets and model artifacts at every
  stage. This allows for instant, undeniable verification that a deployed model matches
  its approved, untampered version. The discussion also touches on **Secure Multi-Party
  Computation (SMPC)** as a future goal for confidential collaborative training, despite
  current performance overheads.

  3.  **Crypto Agility and Quantum Resistance:** Since the first two pillars rely
  on cryptographic verification, the foundation must be quantum-proof. This necessitates
  the mandatory adoption of **Post-Quantum Cryptography (P'
