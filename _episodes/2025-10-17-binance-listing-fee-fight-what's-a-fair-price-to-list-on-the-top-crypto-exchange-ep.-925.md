    principles.

    100% of TVL offer to the token pool and PancakeSwap at $1 million plus. You would

    whose short-term focus (exit liquidity) conflicts directly with the long-term
    vision of decentralized infrastructure.

  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There is a large cohort of people, which some may call a cabal, right, which
    consists of not only centralized exchanges, but also founders and market makers.
    And when you're probably a long-term investor or founder, you look at this kind
    of offer and you think, how on earth does 8% of the entire network... make sense
    if we're talking about the next three, five, or even 10 years over a new infrastructure
    system?
  topic: Investment Thesis/Business Model Critique
- impact_reason: A philosophical stance on where to find genuine information in decentralized
    spaces—in the community feedback ('comments') rather than official announcements
    ('OP').
  relevance_score: 10

    that, that care about truth, the truth is in the comments. It's not in the OP
    that the people strongly projecting.
  topic: Web3 Vision
- impact_reason: Exposes a dangerous trend in tokenomics where large initial allocations
    for centralized entities lead to inevitable retail dumping, highlighting sustainability
    issues.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: there is very much a gray area within these supply distributions where people
    are willing to pay like 8% of token supply, which can never be long-term sustainable
    for the majority of networks, which ultimately just has really dire consequences
    for the hardworking people that believe in this, buy into this, right? Because
    ultimately they are the exit liquidity and they're the ones getting dumped on.

    transparent data (like TVL and flows) that centralized entities obscure.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The benefit of being on-chain is you can see the actual numbers. And there's
    no questions about what are the true inflows/outflows if you go to Uniswap and
    look at their TVL or Aave or any of these, right? You can see the actual numbers.
  topic: Technology/Transparency
- impact_reason: A critical assessment of the current state of the crypto industry,
    noting that most 'crypto businesses' are still centralized and custodial, emphasizing
    the need for true on-chain applications to mature.

  text: I think that as a space and as an industry, we still have a way to go, especially
    for unchained apps. It's only pretty recently that unchained apps really started
    to break out. And I think there's still a long way to go from the current state
    of what are mostly centralized businesses that build on top of crypto and make
    some integrations with that and have crypto deposits, but are still ultimately
    custodial products.
  topic: adoption/strategy

    often employed by large CEXs, backed by implied historical data on listing performance.

  text: Yeah, I don't believe that these kind of supply distributions are a positive
    thing for users and for retail investors. And I would be willing to bet against
    that. And as Nick said, you can just look at the data, right? Like we can just
    look at the chart for Binance listings, and the proof is there.
  topic: investment/defi
- impact_reason: 'A major pivot point: arguing that the focus should shift from token
    speculation to building impactful, mainstream-ready products like prediction markets.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I think at this point, we're talking way too much about tokens. And it's like
    prediction markets are taking crypto mainstream in a way that no other product
    has. And ultimately, it's the products that matter, right? We need—there's so
    much inward nonsense that we focus on in crypto. And it's like, let's focus on
    the products that are pushing this way forward.

    customers into the space through prediction markets.
  topic: technology/adoption
- impact_reason: 'Articulates the correct role of a token: an alignment mechanism
    and ''rocket fuel'' for an already successful product, not the primary value driver.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The token can be rocket fuel on a product that's successful. And we want a
    team to be aligned with users. So we want to create tokens to give ownership of
    the product to users.
  topic: defi/business
- impact_reason: Identifies the core problem of misalignment when massive VC funding
    precedes token distribution, suggesting smaller, user-focused rounds are better
    for long-term alignment.

    the structure of a valuable operating company with the decentralized ownership
    model of a tokenized protocol.'
  relevance_score: 10

  text: to date, in crypto, you've either gone to the Coinbase route of being a public
    company or the Uniswap route of being kind of an on-chain token project. And there

summary: '## Podcast Summary: Binance Listing Fee Fight: What''s a Fair Price to List
  on the Top Crypto Exchange? - Ep. 925


  This episode of Unchained features host Laura Shin, CJ Heatherington (CEO of Limitless
  Labs), and Nick Tomato (GP at One Confirmation) discussing the controversial and
  often opaque listing fee structures imposed by major centralized exchanges (CEXs),
  specifically focusing on the terms revealed by CJ regarding Binance.


  ---


  **1. Focus Area:**

  The primary focus is the **business practices and ethics surrounding token listings
  on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEXs)**, particularly the high fees and
  token allocations demanded by Binance. The discussion contrasts these centralized
  extraction models with the ethos of decentralized, transparent building within the
  broader crypto ecosystem (e.g., on Base).


  **2. Key Technical Insights:**

  *   **Token Distribution as Extraction:** The core critique is that demanding 8%
  or more of a token supply for a listing incentivizes short-term "dumping on retail"
  rather than long-term network sustainability, viewing it as antithetical to crypto''s
  liberating ethos.

  *   **On-Chain Transparency vs. CEX Opacity:** The conversation highlights the verifiable
  nature of on-chain metrics (like DEX TVL or Aave usage) versus the hidden, often
  conflicting data surrounding CEX operations (like real-time inflows/outflows).

  *   **Ecosystem Choice:** CJ explicitly chose to build on Base due to its supportive
  builder ecosystem that avoids these "token supply grabs," suggesting a shift toward
  decentralized infrastructure for new projects.


  **3. Market/Investment Angle:**

  *   **CEX Sentiment at All-Time Low:** The revelation, coupled with recent market
  manipulation events (like liquidity vanishing from oracles), has driven negative
  sentiment toward CEX practices, favoring on-chain alternatives.

  *   **Founder Courage as a Signal:** Nick suggests that founders willing to speak
  truth to power (like challenging Binance) are signaling long-term commitment and
  building real products, attracting more serious partnerships post-revelation.

  *   **Performance of Launchpad Tokens:** The hosts imply that tokens launched via
  these high-fee structures often perform poorly for retail investors in the long
  run, benefiting only the exchange and the initial selling team.


  **4. Notable Companies/People:**

  *   **Binance & CZ:** The central subject. CJ revealed Binance demanded significant
  token allocations (1% airdrop, 3% future airdrops, 1% marketing, 3% BNB Holder Program)
  plus substantial cash deposits ($250k security, $2M BNB security) for a spot listing.
  CZ’s subsequent public reaction (calling CJ a "loser" and engaging in a confusing
  exchange over the confidentiality of the offer) is heavily scrutinized.

  *   **Limitless Labs (CJ Heatherington):** The project whose listing terms sparked
  the controversy.

  *   **One Confirmation (Nick Tomato):** An early investor in Limitless, supporting
  CJ’s transparency move.

  *   **Jesse Pollock:** Mentioned for recently tweeting about CEX listing fees, indicating
  broader industry frustration.


  **5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion:**

  The discussion frames the issue as a matter of **people rising up against centralized
  control**, rather than relying solely on regulators. Nick references Hal Finney’s
  vision of computers as tools for liberation, suggesting that the current fight is
  against corporate control, especially given the current pro-freedom regulatory environment
  in the US. The core argument is that transparency is the necessary defense against
  deceptive practices, echoing lessons learned from the FTX collapse.


  **6. Future Implications:**

  The conversation strongly suggests a **macro trend toward decentralization and transparency**.
  CJ noted that far more builders and institutions are reaching out *after* the tweet,
  indicating that transparency is becoming a competitive advantage. The industry appears
  to be moving away from reliance on centralized gatekeepers for distribution and
  toward on-chain mechanisms.


  **7. Target Audience:**

  This episode is highly valuable for **Crypto Founders, Venture Capitalists, DeFi
  Builders, and Crypto Professionals** interested in the mechanics of token distribution,
  exchange relationships, and the ethical landscape of centralized versus decentralized
  infrastructure.'
