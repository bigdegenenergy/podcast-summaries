summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: PREPARE FOR ALTSEASON! TOP 3 COINS TO BUY IN
  JUNE!


  This 7-minute podcast episode focuses on strategic cryptocurrency investment recommendations
  for the anticipated "Altseason," following Bitcoin''s recent all-time high. The
  host provides three "safer" altcoin picks and three corresponding high-risk "degen"
  alternatives, emphasizing technical analysis (TA) to support the selections.


  ---


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Cryptocurrency Investment Strategy**, specifically identifying
  high-potential **Altcoins** for the next market cycle (targeting 2025 gains). The
  discussion heavily relies on technical indicators, relative performance charts (e.g.,
  ETH/BTC, AVAX/ETH), and market capitalization comparisons.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **ETH/BTC Relative Strength:** The host notes that the ETH/Bitcoin trading chart
  shows the Relative Strength Index (RSI) in an oversold condition, historically preceding
  significant gains for Ethereum against Bitcoin.

  *   **Golden Cross Indicator:** The analysis frequently references the "Golden Cross"
  (50-day Simple Moving Average crossing above the 200-day SMA) as a bullish signal
  for Avalanche (AVAX) and potentially for SWEET, suggesting momentum continuation
  after the cross.

  *   **Relative Performance Strategy:** A key strategy highlighted is analyzing tokens
  priced against high-performing assets (e.g., SWEET priced in SOL), suggesting that
  letting winners ride against other strong assets can yield superior returns.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Ethereum Price Target:** A projection of **$9,000 to $10,000** for Ethereum
  (ETH) by the end of 2025 is suggested based on trendline continuation.

  *   **Market Cap Differential for Gains:** Avalanche (AVAX) is presented as a high-upside
  play due to its significantly smaller market cap ($10B) compared to Ethereum ($320B),
  implying greater percentage gains are possible.

  *   **Risk Tolerance Segmentation:** The episode explicitly segments recommendations
  into "safe bets" and high-risk "degen" plays, warning that the latter requires tolerance
  for significant daily volatility (e.g., 20% red candles).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Ethereum (ETH):** Positioned as the foundational, less risky "safe bet."

  *   **Avalanche (AVAX):** Recommended as the risky counterpart to ETH, noted for
  its EVM compatibility and smaller market cap.

  *   **Solana (SOL):** Selected as the second "safe bet," with upside potential noted
  from its previous high near $270.

  *   **SWEET:** The risky counterpart to Solana, highlighted despite a recent hack
  on its top DEX (Seedest protocol), suggesting a potential discount entry.

  *   **BitTensor (TAO):** The "safe AI bet," dubbed the "Bitcoin of AI" due to its
  Bitcoin-like tokenomics (shrinking rewards).

  *   **Fetch.ai (FET):** The risky AI counterpart to TAO, noted for its smaller market
  cap and historical cyclical pump-and-consolidate patterns.

  *   **Raoul Pal:** Mentioned as being "massively overweight" on SWEET (over 70%
  of his portfolio).

  *   **Chamath Palihapitiya:** Mentioned as being bullish on BitTensor (TAO) from
  the All-In Podcast.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No specific regulatory discussions or policy implications were covered in the provided
  transcript segment.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  The conversation strongly anticipates a sustained **Altseason** following Bitcoin''s
  recent strength, suggesting a rotation of capital into Ethereum, Layer 1 competitors
  (Solana, Avalanche), and the burgeoning **AI narrative** (BitTensor, Fetch.ai).
  The focus on relative performance suggests investors should prioritize assets showing
  strength against market leaders.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This content is highly valuable for **Intermediate to Advanced Cryptocurrency Investors
  and Traders** who are already familiar with basic market cycles, technical analysis
  terminology (RSI, Golden Cross), and are actively managing a portfolio seeking aggressive
  growth during a bull market phase.


  ---


  ### Comprehensive Summary


  The podcast episode serves as a tactical guide for investors preparing their portfolios
  for an anticipated "Altseason" following Bitcoin''s recent price surge. The central
  narrative is structured around presenting three core, relatively safer altcoin picks,
  each paired with a higher-risk, higher-reward alternative suitable for aggressive
  speculators ("degens").


  The first major recommendation is **Ethereum (ETH)**, supported by technical analysis
  showing the ETH/BTC pair is oversold on the weekly RSI, suggesting an imminent reversal
  and outperformance against Bitcoin, with a long-term price target near $9k–$10k
  by 2025. The risky counterpart suggested is **Avalanche (AVAX)**, which, despite
  being an EVM-compatible chain, offers greater upside due to its significantly smaller
  market cap. The host points to a potential Golden Cross on AVAX charts as a bullish
  technical confirmation.


  The second core pick is **Solana (SOL)**, viewed as having substantial upside remaining
  from its previous highs. Its risky counterpart is **SWEET**. The host justifies
  SWEET’s inclusion by referencing massive conviction from major figures like Raoul
  Pal (who allegedly holds over 70% of his portfolio in SWEET) and by demonstrating
  that SWEET has been significantly outperforming Solana on a relative basis over
  the past year. The host notes that a recent hack on SWEET’s DEX might offer a temporary
  discount entry point.


  Finally, the discussion pivots to the **AI sector**.'
