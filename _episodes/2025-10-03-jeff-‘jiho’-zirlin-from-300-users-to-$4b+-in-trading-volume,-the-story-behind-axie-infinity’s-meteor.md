    focus, ETFs, corporate treasuries) from the prior cycle (retail/community focus,
    exchange listings).
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The cycle has been interesting. It's definitely been the institutional cycle,
    right? So, the ETFs, the things like MicroStrategy and basically the digital asset
    treasury companies have really defined the meta where it actually seems kind of
    like last cycle everything was about building a community, getting a product,
    and getting enough traction to be able to get onto Binance and Coinbase. Whereas
    this cycle, it's about the New York Stock Exchange, right?
  topic: Investment/Market Trends
- impact_reason: 'Acknowledges Axie''s role in pioneering P2E/incentives but pivots
    to the evolution: moving from ''helicopter money'' to targeted, sustainable loyalty
    and reputation systems.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: A lot of things last cycle were very centered around token incentives and
    basically giving out helicopter money to attract users to your applications. Obviously,
    we were the pioneers of that. But there's been a lot of progress when it comes
    to basically how do you create these supercharged loyalty programs using token
    incentives rather than something that's kind of an infinite money glitch?
  topic: DeFi/Tokenomics
- impact_reason: 'Explains the direct product evolution from CryptoKitties: identifying
    flaws (lack of utility/stakes) and iterating toward a game with real consequences
    (battle/death) for digital assets.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: There were dozens of people looking for the next CryptoKitties, right? And
    there was also a group of armchair economists, armchair game economists, myself
    included, that were like, hey, there are a couple of fundamental flaws with the
    CryptoKitties model. What if we created basically a game where you could battle
    these NFTs, right? And they could die, they could actually die on-chain if you
    lose, and there was real stakes.
  topic: Technology/Innovation

    introducing scarcity and natural cycles (death/destruction) for long-term sustainability.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And that's actually one of the basically key principles that we had with Axie
    from the beginning is that you basically needed to bring this idea of battles,
    of death, of the actual natural circle of life on-chain to try and build something
    that's a little bit more sustainable.
  topic: Strategy/Innovation
- impact_reason: Provides a concrete, massive metric of success for a Web3 gaming
    project and validates the thesis that games can be mass adoption vectors.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And Axie is the number one NFT project of all time. It's in the Guinness Book
    of World Records with over $4 billion in NFT trading volume. We onboarded millions
    to crypto. Most people just put that on their website and on their pitch deck,
    but we actually did that.
  topic: Adoption
- impact_reason: 'This is the core innovation of Play-to-Earn: democratizing crypto
    earning by turning gameplay into a form of ''mining'' or labor.'
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: We invented the idea of being able to use a digital collectible or an NFT
    to earn a fungible token, so like a normal token. And I think the way that I think
    about this is that a lot of people were interested in mining crypto, but mining
    crypto is something that only a certain percentage of the population is going
    to be able to do. And we basically democratized the act of mining and earning
    your first crypto.

    token incentives/liquidity pools as a self-sustaining user acquisition mechanism.'

  text: a lot of game companies were wasting or using their money for basically to
    buy installs, whereas there might be a more interesting way of basically, can
    you just like deposit those funds directly into like a liquidity pool? And you're

    lowering the barrier to entry for Play-to-Earn games by providing capital/assets
    to players.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: The guild mechanism was also another huge kind of onboarding point. So people
    would basically get, require a ton of Axies and then go out there and search for
    people or pro gamers or people who are really good at games to kind of pilot or
    use these Axies and battle.
  topic: Adoption/DeFi
- impact_reason: A strong prediction that gaming's next major role will be onboarding
    users into DeFi and payments, not just asset ownership.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: I still think that that's like the potential for gaming to onboard people
    into the payments aspect of crypto, the DeFi aspect of crypto. This is something
    that only Axie so far mainly has shown, but there are also some games like Pixels
    and Fishing Frenzy and Cambria that are showing this so far this cycle. But I
    still think that that's untapped, and I still think that that's going to be a
    huge onboarding funnel for like these more like financial primitives within crypto.
  topic: Adoption/DeFi
- impact_reason: Directly links the failure of Ethereum scalability (via CryptoKitties)
    to the necessity of building a dedicated, custom scaling solution (Ronin) for
    consumer applications.
  relevance_score: 10
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: one of the big inflection points as well that I should point out is the Ronin
    network. So, what is Ronin? Well, while we were building Axie from the beginning,
    we knew that scaling was going to be a boss that we had to contend with and slay.
    Why? Because we came from CryptoKitties. CryptoKitties famously or infamously
    clogged the entire Ethereum network.

    the importance of on-chain provable scarcity and mechanics (genetics) in early
    digital collectibles.

    them, you could collect them. One of the interesting things is that they basically

    Cypherpunk ethos—as a necessary societal component.

    the gap between decentralized, community-driven mechanics and the requirements/language
    of traditional finance and institutional investors.'

    with the CryptoKitties model. And one of them was like, you know, CryptoKitties
    can't die.
  topic: Technology/Innovation
- impact_reason: 'Defines the core strategy for mass crypto adoption: using fun, nostalgic,
    non-financial entry points rather than focusing solely on financial incentives.'
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: But to introduce people to crypto through something that's nostalgic and it
    reminds them of childhood, and that's something that's fun, right? Like, we believe
    that the fiat system is coming to a turning point.

    to attract mainstream users; hobbies are the true gateway.

    another way of making money. I actually already knew other ways of making money.
    I wasn''t interested in crypto. But what I was interested in when it appealed
    to my hobbies: collecting, gaming.'

- impact_reason: Directly links token economics and price action to community growth,
    emphasizing the importance of economic balancing in Web3 growth loops.
  relevance_score: 9
  source: llm_enhanced
  text: And as basically the price of the token, the potions, the tokenized potions
    went up, we started to see an inflow of community members. So, it's basically
    taught us that, hey, modulating and really doubling down on also the economic
    balance within the ecosystem was a key growth lever.

    marketing/listing strategy leveraging influential community members (Binance Angels)

    Axies blowing up in Binance, right? And then we were able to basically use that
    to get onto Binance, and then boom, we were able to onboard a bunch of the people
    who were traders but never actually using on-chain applications.
  topic: Adoption/Strategy

    incentivized marketing/onboarding forces.

  text: You know, I think another thing that we had was a really strong community,
    where it was almost like an affiliate program where the early community members
    own the collectible assets, they own your token in pretty large amounts. So, they
    have this natural incentive to almost act as this evangelistic army that's going
    out there manually onboarding people.

    (token incentives and aligned community) despite inherent challenges like attribution.

    consumer app, right? Where attribution can be a little bit tricky, your CPI, or
    your CPI can be cyclical, but yeah, a lot of industries are also cyclical, right?
    But you also have these incredibly powerful tools, which are token incentives,
    a community that's basically aligned with you via aligned token incentives as
    well.

summary: '## Podcast Episode Summary: Jeff ‘Jiho’ Zirlin: From 300 Users to $4B+ in
  Trading Volume, The Story Behind Axie Infinity’s Meteoric Growth


  This episode features Jeff ‘Jiho’ Zirlin, Co-founder of Sky Mavis (creators of Axie
  Infinity and the Ronin blockchain), detailing the journey of building Axie from
  a small community to a global phenomenon with over $4 billion in NFT trading volume.
  The discussion centers on early-stage growth hacking in Web3, the evolution of the
  crypto market cycle, and the strategic necessity of building proprietary infrastructure.


  ### 1. Focus Area

  The primary focus is **Web3 Gaming and Hyper-Growth Strategy**, specifically covering:

  *   **Manual User Onboarding at Scale:** Techniques used to acquire the first few
  hundred users.

  *   **Tokenized Game Economies:** Pioneering the Play-to-Earn (P2E) model by tokenizing
  in-game assets and experience points.

  *   **Infrastructure Development:** The decision and execution behind building the
  custom Ronin sidechain.

  *   **Market Cycles:** Contrasting the retail-driven 2021 cycle with the current
  institutional-focused cycle.


  ### 2. Key Technical Insights

  *   **On-Chain Genetics Inspiration:** CryptoKitties provided the initial blueprint,
  featuring on-chain genes adhering to Mendelian genetics, which inspired Axie’s biological/ecosystem
  approach (incorporating the "cycle of life and destruction" via battles).

  *   **Tokenizing XP for Economy:** Axie tokenized off-chain experience points (XP)
  into tradeable "potions," creating a secondary market and turning user incentives
  into the primary user acquisition budget.

  *   **Building Ronin:** Sky Mavis built the Ronin blockchain from scratch, scaling
  it to support 2 million users within six months, demonstrating the necessity of
  custom infrastructure for high-throughput gaming applications.


  ### 3. Market/Investment Angle

  *   **Institutional vs. Retail Cycles:** The current cycle is defined by institutional
  adoption (ETFs, corporate treasuries) rather than the retail mania seen in 2021,
  shifting focus toward Wall Street relevance.

  *   **Incentives Evolution:** The shift from "helicopter money" (giving out tokens
  to attract users) to creating supercharged, targeted loyalty and reputation systems
  using token incentives.

  *   **Gaming as Onboarding Funnel:** Gaming (like Axie) has a massive advantage
  over pure DeFi/trading apps because gamers represent a much larger potential user
  base for onboarding into broader crypto primitives (payments, DeFi).


  ### 4. Notable Companies/People

  *   **Jeff ‘Jiho’ Zirlin:** Co-founder of Sky Mavis, specializing in community building
  and early growth experimentation.

  *   **CryptoKitties Community:** The origin point where Zirlin met his co-founders
  and other key early NFT builders (like the founder of OpenSea).

  *   **Axie Infinity:** The flagship game, recognized by Guinness World Records as
  the #1 NFT project by trading volume ($4B+).

  *   **Ronin Network:** The proprietary sidechain built by Sky Mavis to support Axie’s
  scaling needs.

  *   **Uniswap:** Mentioned as a key catalyst; early Axie players benefited significantly
  from the Uniswap airdrop, creating a wealth effect that fueled further engagement.


  ### 5. Regulatory/Policy Discussion

  No direct, deep dive into specific regulatory frameworks was covered, but the discussion
  noted the current cycle is "very political," implying that institutional adoption
  is heavily intertwined with navigating regulatory landscapes.


  ### 6. Future Implications

  *   The industry needs to figure out how gaming can appeal to Wall Street metrics,
  which is currently a major focus for infrastructure builders.

  *   There is significant untapped potential for Web3 games to onboard users into
  DeFi and financial primitives, acting as a seamless portal beyond just collecting/trading
  NFTs.

  *   The experimentation mindset—ingraining constant iteration—must remain central
  to growth, especially in emerging markets.


  ### 7. Target Audience

  This episode is highly valuable for **Web3 Founders, Game Developers, Growth Marketers
  in Crypto, and Venture Capitalists** focused on the consumer application layer of
  blockchain technology.'
